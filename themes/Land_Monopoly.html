        cultivation from the earth itself upon which that improvement is made,
        the idea of landed property arose from that inseparable connection; but
        it is nevertheless true that it is value of the improvement only, and
        not the earth itself, that is individual property. Every proprietor,
        therefore, of cultivated land owes to the community a ground-rent, for
        I know no better term to express the idea by, for the land which he holds. &#8230;Cultivation
        is one of the greatest natural improvements ever made. . . .But the landed
        monopoly that began with it has dispossessed more than half the inhabitants
        of every nation of their natural inheritance.&quot; [Thomas Paine, Agrarian

      <p>&#8220;Christ knew better than we that 'No man having put his hand to
        the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God;' nor is many
        man doing his duty who shrinks and is faithless to his fellow-men. Now
        a word more about Abolitionists and new ideas in Government, whatever
        they may be: We are all called Abolitionists now who desire any restriction
        of slavery or believe that the system is wrong, as I have declared for
        years. We are called so, not to help out a peaceful solution, but in
        derision, to abase us, and enable the defamers to make successful combinations
        against us. I never was much annoyed by these, less now than ever. I
        favor the best plan to restrict the extension of slavery peacefully,
        and fully believe that we must reach some plan that will do it, and provide
        for some method of final extinction of the evil, before we can have permanent
        peace on the subject. On other questions there is ample room for reform
        when the time comes; but now it would be folly to think that we could
        undertake more than we have on hand.<strong> </strong>But when slavery is over
        with and settled, men should never rest content while oppressions, wrongs,
        and iniquities are in force against them.</p>
      <p>&#8220;The land, the earth that God gave to man for his home,
          his sustenance, and support, should never be the possession of any
          man, corporation, society, or unfriendly Government, any more than
          the air or the water, if as much. An individual company or enterprise
          requiring land should hold no more in their own right than is needed
          for their home and sustenance, and never more than they have in actual
          use in the prudent management of their legitimate business, and this
          much should not be permitted when it creates an exclusive monopoly.
          All that is not so used should be held for the free use of every family
          to make homesteads, and to hold them as long as they are so occupied.</p>
      <p><strong>&#8220;A reform like this will be worked out some time in the
          future. The idle talk of foolish men, that is so common now, on 'Abolitionists,
          agitators, and disturbers of the peace,' will find its way against
          it, with whatever force it may possess, and as strongly promoted and
          carried on as it can be by land monopolists, grasping landlords, and

          <p>Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down while
            productive power grows, because land, which is the source of all
            wealth and the field of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate poverty,
            to make wages what justice commands they should be, the full earnings
            of the laborer, we must therefore substitute for the individual ownership
            of land a common ownership.*</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">*By the phrase &quot;common ownership&quot; of
                land, Henry George did not mean that land should be held in common
                or by the State, nor did he propose to interfere with the existing
                system of land tenures. (See Sections 7 and 12, post.) As in
                this condensation much of George's argument necessarily has been
                omitted, the following extracts from his later work &quot;Protection
                or Free Trade,&quot; chapter XXVI, are appended to make his position
                clear to the present reader.</font></p>
            <blockquote> <font size="-1">&quot;No one would sow a crop, or build
                a house, or open a mine, or plant an orchard, or cut a drain,
                so long as any one else could come in and turn him out of the
                land in which or on which such improvement must be fixed. Thus
                is it absolutely necessary to the proper use and improvement
                of land that society should secure to the user and improver safe
                possession. ... We can leave land now being used in the secure
                possession of those using it. ... on condition that those who
                hold land shall pay to the community a ... rent based on the
                value of the privilege the individual receives from the community
                in being accorded the exclusive use of this much of the common
                property, and which should have no reference to any improvement
                he has made in or on it, or to any profit due to the use of his
                labor and capital. In this way all would be placed on an equality

        10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
        IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon
        the
production of wealth</a>)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to
          substitute one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for
          all other taxes, as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing
          or the substitution of the use of money for barter.</p>
      <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
          of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would
          be gained by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues
          are now raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear
          more and more important the more they are considered. ...</p>
      <p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
      <p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every
          wheel of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like
          removing an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy,
          production would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus
          which would be felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation
          operates upon exchange like artificial deserts and mountains;</p>
      <ul>
        <li> it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to
              carry them around the world.</li>
        <li> It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like
              a fine upon those qualities.</li>
        <li> If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you
          have been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually
              to make me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing
          me more
              than you.</li>
        <li> If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
        <li> If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though
              he had done an injury to the state;</li>
        <li> if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as
              though it were a public nuisance;</li>
        <li> if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which
          would go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
        <li> We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it
              among us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.</li>
        <li> We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
              grain,</li>
        <li> we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have
          attempted to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for,
          as I have before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls
          in increased prices.</p>
      <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of
        taxation from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the
        great manufactory;
          the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship;
          the farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed.
        All would be free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes,
          unannoyed by the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as
        it
          does now, &quot;The more you add to the general wealth the more shall you
          be taxed!&quot; the state would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious,
          as thrifty, as enterprising as you choose, you shall have your full
          reward! You shall not be fined for making two blades of grass grow
          where one grew
          before; you shall not be taxed for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
      <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that
          lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth
          out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their
          natural reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also
          a natural reward. The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for
          each. No one can keep to himself the good he may do, any more than he can
          keep the bad. Every productive enterprise, besides its return to those
          who undertake it, yields collateral advantages to others. If a man plant
          a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers the fruit in its time and season.
          But in addition to his gain, there is a gain to the whole community. Others
          than the owner are benefited by the increased supply of fruit; the birds
          which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which it helps to attract
          falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which rests upon it
          from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything else.
          The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
          besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
      <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts
          him to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his
          labor, and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more
          that labor and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in
          which all may share. And in the value or rent of land is this general gain
          expressed in a definite and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state
          may take while leaving to labor and capital their full reward. With increased
          activity of production this would commensurately increase.</p>
      <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the
          value or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
          of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system
          no one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld
          from use would everywhere be thrown open to improvement. ...</p>
      <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
          land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as
          agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep
          land from its most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for
          it than the use to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere
          that land had attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now,
          as a fine upon improvement, would operate to force improvement. Whoever
          planted an orchard, or sowed a field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory,
          no matter how costly, would have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept
          so much land idle.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though
              his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with
          stock.</li>
        <li> The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the
          privilege of keeping other people off of it until he wanted to use
          it, as his neighbor
              who has a fine house upon his lot.</li>
        <li> It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon
          valuable land as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile
          of great
              warehouses filled with costly goods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid

        IX Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: Of the Effect Upon Distribution
        and Thence Upon Production</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all
          public burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated
          until we consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
      <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
          in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
          inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
          as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands,
          gives a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced
          by labor and capital.</p>
      <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
          and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
          this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
          the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed.
          Rent, instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality.
          Labor and capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion
          taken by the state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied
          to public purposes, would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
      <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided
          into two portions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
              producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of
          production;</li>
        <li> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
              in public benefits to all its members.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young
          children and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as
          well as the vigorous. And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents
          the result of individual effort in production, the other represents
          the increased power with which the community as a whole aids the individual.</p>
      <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by
          the community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce
          inequality as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater
          and greater equality.</p>
      <p>Who can say to what infinite powers the wealth-producing capacity of labor
          may not be raised by social adjustments which will give to the producers
          of wealth their fair proportion of its advantages and enjoyments! With
          present processes the gain would be simply incalculable, but just as wages
          are high, so do the invention and utilization of improved processes and
          machinery go on with greater rapidity and ease.</p>
      <p> But I shall not deny, and do not wish to lose sight of the fact, that
          while thus preventing waste and thus adding to the efficiency of labor,
          the equalization in the distribution of wealth that would result from
        the simple plan of taxation that I propose, must lessen the intensity
        with
          which wealth is pursued. It seems to me that in a condition of society
          in which no one need fear poverty, no one would desire great wealth &#8212; at
          least, no one would take the trouble to strive and to strain for it
          as men do now. For, certainly, the spectacle of men who have only a
          few years
          to live, slaving away their time for the sake of dying rich, is in
          itself so unnatural and absurd, that in a state of society where the
          abolition
          of the fear of want had dissipated the envious admiration with which
          the masses of men now regard the possession of great riches, whoever
          would
          toil to acquire more than he cared to use would be looked upon as we
          would now look on a man who would thatch his head with half a dozen
          hats.</p>
      <p>And though this incentive to production be withdrawn, can we not spare
          it? Whatever may have been its office in an earlier stage of development,
          it is not needed now. The dangers that menace our civilization do not come
          from the weakness of the springs of production. What it suffers from, and
          what, if a remedy be not applied, it must die from, is unequal distribution!</p>
      <p>Nor would the removal of this incentive, regarded only from the standpoint
          of production, be an unmixed loss. For, that the aggregate of production
          is greatly reduced by the greed with which riches are pursued, is one of
          the most obtrusive facts of modern society. While, were this insane desire
          to get rich at any cost lessened, mental activities now devoted to scraping
          together riches would be translated into far higher spheres of usefulness.

        14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
      X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our
          inquiry is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the
          growth and decay of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated
          recognitions of relation and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions.
          Thus are given to our conclusions the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
      <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils
          arising from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are becoming
          more and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents
          of progress, but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they
          will not cure themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause
          is removed, grow greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism
          by the road every previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that
          these evils are not imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from
          social maladjustments which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their
          cause we shall be giving an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
      <p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men,
          and all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of
          justice. <strong>In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities
          which nature freely offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law
          of justice &#8212; for,
          so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems
          to be the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice
          and asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall
          conform ourselves to the law &#8212;</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution
              of wealth and power; </li>
        <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
        <li>tame the ruthless passions of greed; </li>
        <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
        <li>light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; </li>
        <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse to discovery; </li>
        <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
        <li>make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
          or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it
        will make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in
        letter
          and spirit of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
          that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all
          men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
          certain
          inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit
          of happiness!&quot;</p>
      <p><strong>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which
          and by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political
          rights will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty
          of nature. Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes,
          as population increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete
          for employment at starvation wages. </strong>This is the truth that we have ignored.
          And so</p>
      <ul>
        <li> there come beggars in our streets and tramps on our roads; and</li>
        <li> poverty enslaves men who we boast are political sovereigns; and</li>
        <li> want breeds ignorance that our schools cannot enlighten; and</li>
        <li> citizens vote as their masters dictate; and</li>
        <li> the demagogue usurps the part of the statesman; and</li>
        <li> gold weighs in the scales of justice; and</li>
        <li> in high places sit those who do not pay to civic virtue even the
          compliment of hypocrisy; and</li>
        <li> the pillars of the republic that we thought so strong already bend
              under an increasing strain.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her statues and sound
          her praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so
          grow her
    demands. She will have no half service!</p>
      <p>Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings.
          For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the
          law of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation.</p>
      <p>They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission when she
          has abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot, who think
          of her as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of life,
          have not seen her real grandeur &#8212; to them the poets who have
          sung of her must seem rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun
          is the
          lord of life, as well as of light; as his beams not merely pierce the
          clouds, but support all growth, supply all motion, and call forth from
          what would
          otherwise be a cold and inert mass all the infinite diversities of
          being and beauty, so is liberty to mankind. It is not for an abstraction
          that
          men have toiled and died; that in every age the witnesses of Liberty
          have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty have suffered.</p>
      <p>We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge, invention,
          national strength, and national independence as other things. But, of all
          these, Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary condition. ...</p>
      <p>Only in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet beamed
          among men, but all progress hath she called forth. ...</p>
      <p>Shall we not trust her?</p>
      <p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
          inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower.
          Liberty calls to us again. <strong>We must follow her further; we must
          trust her fully. Either we must wholly accept her or she will not stay.
          It is not
          enough that men should vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically
          equal before the law. They must have liberty to avail themselves of the
          opportunities and means of life; they must stand on equal terms with reference
          to the bounty of nature. Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light! </strong>Either
          this, or darkness comes on, and the very forces that progress has evolved
          turn to powers that work destruction. This is the universal law. This is
          the lesson of the centuries. Unless its foundations be laid in justice
          the social structure cannot stand.</p>
      <p><strong>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing
          one man to own the land on which and from which other men must live,
          we have
        made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress
        goes on. </strong>This is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not realize is
        extracting from the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their
        weary toil; that is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place
        of that which has been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism
        out of political freedom, and must soon transmute democratic institutions
        into anarchy.</p>
      <p><strong>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into
          a curse</strong>.
        It is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
        houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
        them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
        that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
      <p><strong>Civilization so based cannot continue.</strong> The eternal
        laws of the universe forbid it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the
        witness that is in every
          soul answers, that it cannot be. It is something grander than Benevolence,
          something more august than Charity &#8212; it is Justice herself that demands
          of us to right this wrong. Justice that will not be denied; that cannot
          be put off &#8212; Justice that with the scales carries the sword.
          Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies and prayers? Shall we avert
          the decrees
          of immutable law by raising churches when hungry infants moan and weary
          mothers weep?</p>
      <p><strong>Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that
          attributes to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and
          brutishness that come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the
          All-Father and lays on Him the responsibility for the want and crime
          of our great cities. </strong>We degrade the Everlasting. We slander
          the Just One. A merciful man would have better ordered the world; a
          just man would crush with his foot such an ulcerous ant-hill! It is
          not the
          Almighty, but we who are responsible for the vice and misery that fester
          amid our civilization. The Creator showers upon us his gifts &#8212; more
          than enough for all. But like swine scrambling for food, we tread them
          in the mire &#8212; tread them in the mire, while we tear and rend
          each other!</p>
      <p><strong>In the very centers of our civilization today are want and suffering
          enough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his eyes and steel
          his nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to relieve it?</strong> Supposing
          the prayer were heard, and at the behest with which the universe sprang
          into being there should glow in the sun a greater power; new virtue fill
          the air; fresh vigor the soil; that for every blade of grass that now
          grows two should spring up, and the seed that now increases fiftyfold
          should increase a hundredfold! Would poverty be abated or want relieved?
          Manifestly no! Whatever benefit would accrue would be but temporary.
          The new powers streaming through the material universe could be utilized
          only through land.</p>
      <p>This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a fact of experience. <strong>We
          know it because we have seen it. </strong>Within our own times, under
          our very eyes, that Power which is above all, and in all, and through
          all; that Power of which the whole universe is but the manifestation;
          that Power which maketh all things, and without which is not anything
          made that is made, has increased the bounty which men may enjoy, as truly
          as though the fertility of nature had been increased. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Into the mind of one came the thought that harnessed steam for the
              service of mankind. </li>
        <li>To the inner ear of another was whispered the secret that compels
          the lightning to bear a message round the globe. </li>
        <li>In every direction have the laws of matter been revealed; </li>
        <li>in every department of industry have arisen arms of iron and fingers
              of steel, whose effect upon the production of wealth has been precisely
              the same as an increase in the fertility of nature. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What has been the result? Simply that landowners get all the gain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Can it be that the gifts of the Creator may be thus misappropriated
          with impunity? Is it a light thing that labor should be robbed of its
          earnings while greed rolls in wealth &#8212; that the many should want
          while the few are surfeited? </strong>Turn to history, and on every
          page may be read the lesson that such wrong never goes unpunished;
          that the
          Nemesis that follows injustice never falters nor sleeps! Look around
          today. Can this state of things continue? May we even say, &quot;After
          us the deluge!&quot; Nay; the pillars of the State are trembling even
          now, and the very foundations of society begin to quiver with pent-up
          forces that glow underneath. The struggle that must either revivify,
          or convulse in ruin, is near at hand, if it be not already begun.</p>
      <p>The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers
          born of progress, forces have entered the world that will either compel
          us to a higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as civilization
          after civilization, have been overwhelmed before. ... </p>
      <ul>
        <li> We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp.</li>
        <li> We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and
              then refusing them the right to earn an honest living.</li>
        <li> We cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then
              denying the inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even now, in old bottles the new wine begins to ferment, and elemental
          forces gather for the strife!</p>
      <p><strong>But if, while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey her,
          if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now threaten must
          disappear,<em> the forces that now menace will turn to agencies of elevation.</em> </strong>Think
          of the powers now wasted; of the infinite fields of knowledge yet to
          be explored; of the possibilities of which the wondrous inventions of
          this century give us but a hint.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> With want destroyed;</li>
        <li> with greed changed to noble passions;</li>
        <li> with the fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> An acquaintance of mine died in San Francisco
    recently, leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in England.
    I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more temperate than
    he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This man did not get
    his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He no more produced it than
    did those lucky relations in England who may now do nothing for the rest
    of their lives. He became rich by getting hold of a piece of land in the
    early days, which, as San Francisco grew, became very valuable. His wealth
    represented not what he had earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of
    the earth's surface enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the other day,
    leaving $3,000,000. He may or may not have been particularly industrious,
    skilful and economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that
    he got so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby through
    a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against the pauper labor
    of Europe," gave him the advantage of a sixty-per-cent, tariff. To the day
    of his death he was a stanch protectionist, and said free trade would ruin
    our "infant industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to
    lay by from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
    what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by the tariff
    that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's earnings.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small>"Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
  of wealth."</small>
</center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element of monopoly, of appropriation
    and spoliation will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account
    for all great fortunes....</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt fortune. The
    first Vanderbilt was a boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it.
    But it was not working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
    fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money enough he
    used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He ran off opposition
    lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel. Then he went into railroads,
    pursuing the same tactics. The Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working
    and saving than did the fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune. Mr. Gould
    might have got his first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial.
    But it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions. It
    was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures, getting
    up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock values and
    transportation rates. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great fortunes which
    the Pacific railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
    profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations of
    Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by monopolizing and gouging.
    And so of fortunes made by such combinations as the Standard Oil Company,
    the Bessemer Steel Ring, the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and
    the various rings for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper
    labor of Europe." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of successful
    patents. Like that element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased
    value of land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I
    am not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
    in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make fortunes
    out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and, in fact,
    through nearly all acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes,
    these elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
    of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me recently, "It
    is not on our ordinary business that we make our money; it is where we can
    get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally true.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>The Evils of Monopolists</b></small> <br>
  <small> Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the increase
  of land values has had, and is having, in the United States. This is, of course,
  monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in value it does not mean that
  its owner has added to the general wealth. The owner may never have seen the
  land or done aught to improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant
  city or in another country. Increase of land values simply means that the owners,
  by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed before man was,
  have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth produced by other people's
  labor. Consider how much the monopolies created and the advantages given to
  the unscrupulous by the tariff and by our system of internal taxation -- how
  much the railroad (a business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water
  and other similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
  rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and stock-gambling, the
  destructive use of wealth in driving off or buying off opposition which the
  public must finally pay for, and many other things which these will suggest,
  have operated to build up large fortunes, and it will at least appear that
  the unequal distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
  that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many who work
  little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the earnings of the one
  class are, in one way or another, filched away from them to swell the incomes
  of the other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly making
    their way from the ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the
    ranks of those who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state
    of things right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
    pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that piracy
    was right and that no effort should be made to suppress it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I am not denouncing the rich, nor seeking,
    by speaking of these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get
    a clear understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that
    it is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which we
    give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by law and
    by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so enormously rich while
    others remain so miserably poor. If we look around us and note the elements
    of monopoly, extortion and spoliation which go to the building up of all,
    or nearly all, fortunes, we see on the one hand now disingenuous are those
    who preach to us that there is nothing wrong in social relations and that
    the inequalities in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities
    of human nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk
    as though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
    restricting the acquisition of wealth. <strong>Capital is a good; the capitalist
    is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely let any one get
    as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in doing so.</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There are deep wrongs in the present constitution
    of society, but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor
    in those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are the
    laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from bad adjustments
    which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social state is not that
    in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but in which each gets in proportion
    to his contribution to the general stock. And in such a social state there
    would not be less incentive to exertion than now; there would be far more
    incentive. Men will be more industrious and more moral, better workmen and
    better citizens, if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his
    family, than where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them
    until some have far more than they could have earned, and others have little
or nothing.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  <p>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</p>
  <p>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
    of what some have to sell and others must buy.</p>
  <p>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
    it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</p>
  <p>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
    sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
    and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to
    do.</p>
  <p>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
    thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest
    division of wealth.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
    of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
    octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
    duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
    on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
    the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
    be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
    need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
    deem a right one?</p>
  <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
    the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
    scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
    price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
    they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
    thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
    others.</p>
  <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
    of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
  <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
    are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
    that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
    the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
    effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
    buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
    gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
    of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
    sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
    it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
    of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
    instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
    of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
  <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
    show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
    intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
  <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
    a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
    the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
    of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
    in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
    of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
    reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
    always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
    user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
    pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
    the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
    or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
    to be a user.</p>
  <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
    of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
    what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
    to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
    community as a whole.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
        are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
        what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
        from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
        for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
        be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
        in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
        will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
        as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
        determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
        the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
        increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
        cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
        or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
        in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
        recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
        cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
        Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
          by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
          and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
          can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
      2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
      particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
      by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
      for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
      3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
      in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
      social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
      withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
        be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
        the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
        land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
        because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
        economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
        were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
        since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
        of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
        receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
        demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
        to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
        were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
        for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
        merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
    of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
    to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
    impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
    it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
    by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
    artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
    that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
    most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
    enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
    temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
    innocent.</p>
  <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
    needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
    of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
    nourishment of the babe.</p>
  <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
    the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
    but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
    But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
    necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
    begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
    more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
    time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
    The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
    since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
    steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
    centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
    Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
    of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
    due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
    cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
    streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
    health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
    of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
    the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
    improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
    law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
    anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
    values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
  <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
    and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
    If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
    with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
    the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
    us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
    that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
  <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one thing
    that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue of which
    all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general improvements
    of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the
    dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
    Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
    is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it
    not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
    while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with the
    advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each member
    of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from
    his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen
    relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
    the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
    the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
    should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater
    equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
    an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Take, for instance, protectionism. What support it has, beyond the mere
    selfish desire of sellers to compel buyers to pay them more than their goods
    are worth, springs from such superficial ideas as that production, not consumption,
    is the end of effort; that money is more valuable than money&#8217;s-worth,
    and to sell more profitable than to buy; and above all from a desire to limit
    competition, springing from an unanalyzing recognition of the phenomena that
    necessarily follow when men who have the need to labor are deprived by monopoly
    of access to the natural and indispensable element of all labor. Its methods
    involve the idea that governments can more wisely direct the expenditure
    of labor and the investment of capital than can laborers and capitalists,
    and that the men who control governments will use this power for the general
    good and not in their own interests. They tend to multiply officials, restrict
    liberty, invent crimes. They promote perjury, fraud and corruption. And they
    would, were the theory carried to its logical conclusion, destroy civilization
    and reduce mankind to savagery. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>I have already referred generally to the defects that attach to all socialistic
    remedies for the evil condition of labor, but respect for your Holiness dictates
    that I should speak specifically, even though briefly, of the remedies proposed
    or suggested by you.</p>
  <p>Of these, the widest and strongest are that the state should restrict the
    hours of labor, the employment of women and children, the unsanitary conditions
    of workshops, etc. Yet how little may in this way be accomplished.</p>
  <p>A strong, absolute ruler might hope by such regulations to alleviate the
    conditions of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our times is toward democracy,
    and democratic states are necessarily weaker in paternalism, while in the
    industrial slavery, growing out of private ownership of land, that prevails
    in Christendom today, it is not the master who forces the slave to labor,
    but the slave who urges the master to let him labor. Thus the greatest difficulty
    in enforcing such regulations comes from those whom they are intended to
    benefit. It is not, for instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce
    restrictions on child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, prompted
    by poverty, misrepresent the ages of their children even to the masters,
    and teach the children to misrepresent.</p>
  <p>But while in large factories and mines regulations as to hours, ages, etc.,
    though subject to evasion and offering opportunities for extortion and corruption,
    may be to some extent enforced, how can they have any effect in those far
    wider branches of industry where the laborer works for himself or for small
    employers?</p>
  <p>All such remedies are of the nature of the remedy for overcrowding that
    is generally prescribed with them &#8212; the restriction under penalty of
    the number who may occupy a room and the demolition of unsanitary buildings.
    Since these measures have no tendency to increase house accommodation or
    to augment ability to pay for it, the overcrowding that is forced back in
    some places goes on in other places and to a worse degree. All such remedies
    begin at the wrong end. They are like putting on brake and bit to hold in
    quietness horses that are being lashed into frenzy; they are like trying
    to stop a locomotive by holding its wheels instead of shutting off steam;
    like attempting to cure smallpox by driving back its pustules. Men do not
    overwork themselves because they like it; it is not in the nature of the
    mother&#8217;s heart to send children to work when they ought to be at play;
    it is not of choice that laborers will work under dangerous and unsanitary
    conditions. These things, like overcrowding, come from the sting of poverty.
    And so long as the poverty of which they are the expression is left untouched,
    restrictions such as you indorse can have only partial and evanescent results.
    The cause remaining, repression in one place can only bring out its effects
    in other places, and the task you assign to the state is as hopeless as to
    ask it to lower the level of the ocean by bailing out the sea.</p>
  <p>Nor can the state cure poverty by regulating wages. It is as much beyond
    the power of the state to regulate wages as it is to regulate the rates of
    interest. Usury laws have been tried again and again, but the only effect
    they have ever had has been to increase what the poorer borrowers must pay,
    and for the same reasons that all attempts to lower by regulation the price
    of goods have always resulted merely in increasing them. The general rate
    of wages is fixed by the ease or difficulty with which labor can obtain access
    to land, ranging from the full earnings of labor, where land is free, to
    the least on which laborers can live and reproduce, where land is fully monopolized.
    Thus, where it has been comparatively easy for laborers to get land, as in
    the United States and in Australasia, wages have been higher than in Europe
    and it has been impossible to get European laborers to work there for wages
    that they would gladly accept at home; while as monopolization goes on under
    the influence of private property in land, wages tend to fall, and the social
    conditions of Europe to appear. Thus, under the partial yet substantial recognition
    of common rights to land, of which I have spoken, the many attempts of the
    British Parliament to reduce wages by regulation failed utterly. And so,
    when the institution of private property in land had done its work in England,
    all attempts of Parliament to raise wages proved unavailing. In the beginning
    of this century it was even attempted to increase the earnings of laborers
    by grants in aid of wages. But the only result was to lower commensurately
    what wages employers paid.</p>
  <p>The state could maintain wages above the tendency of the market (for as
    I have shown labor deprived of land becomes a commodity), only by offering
    employment to all who wish it; or by lending its sanction to strikes and
    supporting them with its funds. Thus it is, that the thoroughgoing socialists
    who want the state to take all industry into its hands are much more logical
    than those timid socialists who propose that the state should regulate private
    industry &#8212; but only a little.</p>
  <p>The same hopelessness attends your suggestion that working-people should
    be encouraged by the state in obtaining a share of the land. It is evident
    that by this you mean that, as is now being attempted in Ireland, the state
    shall buy out large landowners in favor of small ones, establishing what
    are known as peasant proprietors. Supposing that this can be done even to
    a considerable extent, what will be accomplished save to substitute a larger
    privileged class for a smaller privileged class? What will be done for the
    still larger class that must remain, the laborers of the agricultural districts,
    the workmen of the towns, the proletarians of the cities? Is it not true,
    as Professor De Laveleye says, that in such countries as Belgium, where peasant
    proprietary exists, the tenants, for there still exist tenants, are rack-rented
    with a mercilessness unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that in such countries
    as Belgium the condition of the mere laborer is even worse than it is in
    Great Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if the state attempts to
    buy up land for peasant proprietors will not the effect be, what is seen
    today in Ireland, to increase the market value of land and thus make it more
    difficult for those not so favored, and for those who will come after, to
    get land? How, moreover, on the principle which you declare (36), that &#8220;to
    the state the interests of all are equal, whether high or low,&#8221; will
    you justify state aid to one man to buy a bit of land without also insisting
    on state aid to another man to buy a donkey, to another to buy a shop, to
    another to buy the tools and materials of a trade &#8212; state aid in short
    to everybody who may be able to make good use of it or thinks that he could?
    And are you not thus landed in communism &#8212; not the communism of the
    early Christians and of the religious orders, but communism that uses the
    coercive power of the state to take rightful property by force from those
    who have, to give to those who have not? For the state has no purse of Fortunatus;
    the state cannot repeat the miracle of the loaves and fishes; all that the
    state can give, it must get by some form or other of the taxing power. And
    whether it gives or lends money, or gives or lends credit, it cannot give
    to those who have not, without taking from those who have.</p>
  <p>But aside from all this, any scheme of dividing up land while maintaining
    private property in land is futile. Small holdings cannot coexist with the
    treatment of land as private property where civilization is materially advancing
    and wealth augments. We may see this in the economic tendencies that in ancient
    times were the main cause that transformed world-conquering Italy from a
    land of small farms to a land of great estates. We may see it in the fact
    that while two centuries ago the majority of English farmers were owners
    of the land they tilled, tenancy has been for a long time the all but universal
    condition of the English farmer. And now the mighty forces of steam and electricity
    have come to urge concentration. It is in the United States that we may see
    on the largest scale how their power is operating to turn a nation of landowners
    into a nation of tenants. The principle is clear and irresistible. Material
    progress makes land more valuable, and when this increasing value is left
    to private owners land must pass from the ownership of the poor into the
    ownership of the rich, just as diamonds so pass when poor men find them.
    What the British government is attempting in Ireland is to build snow-houses
    in the Arabian desert! to plant bananas in Labrador!</p>

        <p>It is the old, old story! And no wonder, for property
          in land is just as absurd! just as monstrous as property in human beings.
          (Hear, hear, and cheers) What
        difference does it make whether you enslave a man by making his flesh
          and blood the property of another, or whether you enslave him by making
          the
          property
        of another that element on which and from which he must live if he is
          to live at all? (A voice: &quot;None whatever!&quot; and cheers)</p>

      <div align="left">
        <p>Why, in those old days slave ships used to set out from
          this town of Liverpool for the coast of Africa to buy slaves. They
          did not bring them to Liverpool;
        they took them over to America. Why? Because you people were so good,
          and the Englishmen who had got to the other side of the Atlantic, and
          had
          settled there,
        were so bad? Not at all. I will tell you why the Liverpool ships carried
          slaves to America and did not bring them back to England. Because in
          America population
        was sparse and land was plentiful. Therefore to rob a man of his labor &#8212; and
        that is what the slaveowner wanted the slave for &#8212; you had got to catch
        and hold the man. That is the reason the slaves went to America. The reason
        they did not come here, the reason they were not carried over to Ireland was
        that here population was relatively dense, land was relatively scarce and could
        easily be monopolized, and to get out of the laborer all that his labor could
        furnish, save only wages enough to keep him alive even the slaveowner had to
        give this &#8212; it was only necessary to own land.</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>What is the difference, economically speaking, between
          the slaves of South Carolina, Missouri, Mississippi, and Georgia and
          the free peasantry of Ireland
        or the agricultural laborer of England? (Cheers) Go to one of those slave
          states in the slave days, and there you would find a planter, the owner
          of five hundred
        slaves, living in elegant luxury, without doing a stroke of work, having
          a fine mansion, horses, [and a] carriage &#8212; all the things that
          work produces, but doing none of it himself. The people who did the
          work were living in negro
        huts, on coarse food; they were clothed in coarse raiment. If they ran
          away, he had the privilege of chasing them back, tying them up and
          whipping them
        and making them work.</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Come to this side of the Atlantic, in a place where you saw the same state
        of development. There you found also five hundred people living in little cabins,
        eating coarse food, clothed in coarse raiment, working hard, yet getting only
        enough of the things that work produces to keep them in good times, when bad
        times came having to appeal to the world for charity. But you found among those
        little cabins, too, the lordly mansion of the man who did no work. (Hear, hear,
        and groans)</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>You found the mansion; you did not often find the man. (Laughter and cheers)
        As a general rule he was off in London, or in Paris, enjoying himself on the
        fruits of their labor. (Hear, hear) He had no legal right to make them work
        for him. Oh! no. If they ran away he could not put bloodhounds on their track
        and bring them back and whip them; but he had, in hunger, in starvation, a
        ban dog40 more swift, more keen, more sure than the bloodhound of the south.

      <div align="left">
        <p>The slaveowner of the south &#8212; the owner of men &#8212; had to make those

    <blockquote>
      <div align="left">Everybody nowadays is anxious to help do something for
        the poor, especially they who are on the backs of the poor; they will
        do anything that is not fundamental.
      Nobody ever dreams of giving the poor a chance to help themselves. The
        reformers in this state have passed a law prohibiting women from working
        more than eight
      hours in one day in certain industries &#8212; so much do women love to
      work that they must be stopped by law. If any benevolent heathen see fit
      to come
      here and do work, we send them to gaol or send them back where they came
      from.</div>
      <div align="left">All these prohibitory laws are froth. You can only cure effects by curing
      the cause. Every sin and every wrong that exists in the world is the product
      of law, and you cannot cure it without curing the cause. Lawyers, as a class,
      are very stupid. What would you think of a doctor, who, finding a case of malaria,
      instead of draining the swamp, would send the patient to gaol, and leave the
      swamp where it is? We are seeking to improve conditions of life by improving
      symptoms.</div>
      <div align="left">Land Basic</div>
      <div align="left">No man created the earth, but to a large extent all take
        from the earth a portion of it and mould it into useful things for the
        use of man. Without land
      man cannot live; without access to it man cannot labor. First of all, he
        must have the earth, and this he cannot have access to until the single
        tax is applied.
      It has been proven by the history of the human race that the single tax
        does work, and that it will work as its advocates claim. For instance,
        man turned
      from Europe, filled with a population of the poor, and discovered the great
      continent of America. Here, when he could not get profitable employment,
        he went on the free land and worked for himself, and in those early days
        there
      were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully rich and no extremely poor &#8212; because
      there was cheap land. Men could go to work for themselves, and thus take the
      surplus off the labor market. There were no beggars in the early days. It was
      only when the landlord got in his work &#8212; when the earth monopoly was

        they can.
              It is as if some raft filled with shipwrecked sailors should be
        floating on the ocean, and a few of the strongest and most powerful would
        take
              all the raft they could get and leave the most of the people, especially
              the ones who did the work, hanging to the edges by their eyebrows.
              These men who have taken possession of this raft, this little planet
              in this endless space, are not even content with taking all there
        is and leaving the rest barely enough to hold onto, but they think so
              much of themselves and their brief day that while they live they
        must
              make rules and laws and regulations that parcel out the earth for
        thousands of years after they are dead and, gone, so that their descendants
        and
              others of their kind may do in the tenth generation exactly what
        they are doing today &#8212; keeping the earth and all the good things
        of the earth and compelling the great mass of mankind to toil for them.</div>
      <div align="left">Now, the question is, how are you going to get it back?
        Everybody who thinks knows that private ownership of the land is wrong.
        If ten
            thousand men can own America, then one man can own it, and if one
        man may own it he may take all that the rest produce or he may kill them
            if he sees fit. It is inconsistent with the spirit of manhood. No
        person
            who thinks can doubt but that he was born upon this planet with the
            same birthright that came to every man born like him. And it is for
            him to defend that birthright. And the man who will not defend it,
            whatever the cost, is fitted only to be a slave. The earth belongs
            to the people &#8212; if they can get it &#8212; because if you cannot
            get it, it makes no difference whether you have a right to it or
            not, and if you can get it, it makes no difference whether you have
            a right
            to it or not, you just take it. The earth has been taken from the
            many by the few. It made no difference that they had no right to
            it; they
            took it.</div>
      <div align="left">Now, there are some methods of getting access to the earth which are
            easier than others. The easiest, perhaps, that has been contrived is
            by means of taxation of the land values and land values alone; and
            I need only say a little upon that question. One trouble with it which
            makes it almost impossible to achieve, is that it is so simple and
            so easy. You cannot get people to do anything that is simple; they
            want it complex so they can be fooled.</div>
      <div align="left">Now the theory of Henry George and of those who really
        believe in the common ownership of land is that the public should take
        not alone
            taxation from the land, but the public should take to itself the
        whole value of the land that has been created by the public &#8212; should
            take it all. It should be a part of the public wealth, should be used
            for public improvements, for pensions, and belong to the people who
            create the wealth &#8212; which is a strange doctrine in these strange
            times. It can be done simply and easily; it can be done by taxation.
            All the wealth created by the public could be taken back by the public
            and then poverty would disappear, most of it at least. The method is
            so simple, and so legal even &#8212; sometimes a thing is legal if
            it is simple &#8212; that it is the easiest substantial reform for
            men to accomplish, and when it is done this great problem of poverty,
          the problem of the ages, will be almost solved. We may need go farther. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_Land_Belongs.html">read

        building site, or it might be something else - if there was only one
        man who wanted it, of course he would not offer me much, but if the
        land be really worth anything such a circumstance is not likely to
        happen. On the contrary, there would be a number who would want it,
        and they would go on bidding and bidding one against the other, in
        order to get it. I should accept the highest offer - what could be
        fairer? Every increase of population, extension of trade, every
        advance in the arts and sciences would, as we all know, increase the
        value of land, and the competition that would naturally arise would
        continue to force rents upward, so much so, that in many cases the
        tenants would have little or nothing left for themselves.... <a

  <blockquote>
    <p>Note 88: &quot;Rent is the effect of a monopoly; though the monopoly
      is a natural one, which may be regulated, which may even be held as a trust
      for the
      community generally, but which cannot be prevented from existing. . . If
      all the land of the country belonged to one person he could fix the rent
      at his pleasure. . . The effect would be much the same if the land belonged
      to so few people that they could and did act together as one man and the
      rent by agreement among themselves . . . The only remaining supposition
      is that of free competition. &#8212; Mill's Prin., book ii, ch. xvi, sec.
      I.</p>
    <p>Rent &quot;considered as the price paid for the use of the land is naturally
      a monopoly price.&quot; &#8212; Smith's Wealth of Nations, book o, ch.
      xi. </p>
    <p>Note 89: The line of separation between the poorest land thus commanding
      a premium, and the best land for which labor will not pay a premium, was
      formerly called &quot;the margin of cultivation,&quot; probably because
      the law of rent was not understood with reference to any but agricultural
      land; but it is now more generally called &quot;the margin of production,&quot; since
      it is understood that the law of rent applies to all kinds of land, including,
      of course, the building lots of cities.</p>
    <p>The premium for land falls not into the fund termed Wages, but into the
      fund termed Rent. Henceforth Wages consist not of the entire product of
      labor, but of so much of that product as might with the same expenditure
      of labor force be produced from the best land that commands no premium.
      The remainder goes to the owners of the land from which it is in fact produced,
      in proportion to the advantages which their land respectively contributes
      to its production. This excess is the premium. It is what constitutes Rent
      as distinguished from Wages. And both the amount of the general fund Rent,
      and the amount of rent which each land-owner obtains, are determined by
      the competition of labor for superior opportunities.</p>
    <p>Thus, in the beginnings all Wealth would be Wages; but as labor was forced
      from better to poorer lands, or, what is the same thing in its principle
      of operation, as greater capabilities attached to particular lands in consequence
      of social development, good government, industrial improvement, etc. Rent
      would arise, and as a proportion of the gross Wealth-product, would increase
      as labor was forced to poorer land or new capabilities were added to land
      by society. The law derived from these phenomena is known as Ricardo's
      law of rent. Henry George formulates it as follows:</p>
    <p>&quot;The rent of land is determined by the excess of its produce over
      that which the same application can secure from the least productive land
      in use.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iii, ch. ii.</p>
    <p>As will be noticed, the law is the law of Wages as well as the law of
      Rent. For whatever determines the proportion of Wealth to be taken as Rent
      necessarily determines the proportion to be left as Wages. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
    <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
    <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social
      progress, while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent
      be treated as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps
      in the direction of realizing through orderly and natural growth those
      grand conceptions of both the socialist and the individualist, which in
      the present condition of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not
      likewise a plain warning that if Rent be treated as private property, advances
      in productive power will be steps in the direction of making slaves of
      the many laborers, and masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that
      common ownership of Rent is in harmony with natural law, and that its private
      appropriation is disorderly and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the
      tendency illustrated in the preceding chart are considered in connection
      with <strong>the self-evident truth that God made the earth for common
      use and not for private monopoly</strong>, how can a contrary inference hold? Caused and
      increased by social growth, 97 the benefits of which should be common,
      and attaching to land, the just right to which is equal, Rent must be the
      natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary
          settler. Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues,
          and none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes,
          and another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
          Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little;
          perhaps just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village
          becomes a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher.
          It becomes a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so
          are the land values.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising
          with the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline
          of society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as
          distinguished from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand,
          measure the earning power of the individuals as distinguished from
          that of society as a whole. We have distinguished the parts into which
          Wealth is distributed as Wages and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed
          it is the same thing, to regard all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish
          the two kinds as Communal Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then,
          can there be any question as to the fund from which society should
          be supported? How can it be justly supported in any other way than
          out of its own earnings?</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and
      who can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings
      of the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and
      that Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual
      in proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether
      we trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in
      the eighth commandment. </p>
    <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
    <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
      creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
      therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
      nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
      fear of poverty.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">99. &quot;Whatever dispute arouses the passions of men,
          the conflict is sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it
          wise?' as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an
          ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind;
          it rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably
          the deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that
          alone is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual
          actions and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but in
          the wider field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;I bow to this arbitrament, and accept this test.&quot; &#8212; Progress
          and Poverty, book vii, ch. i.</font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with
      the white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession
      of the best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
      need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
      space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
      the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
      with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
    <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
      Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
      social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
      Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
      as such, earn nothing.100</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a
          workman in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession
          of it after much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
          the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
          and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
          of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
          nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
          title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which
          it fell.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
      of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
      chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to
      go upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much
      will they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and
      not to hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full
      difference between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next
      best. But if the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon
      be scarce and theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent
      at that valuation, the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade,
      though the best be as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first
      grade commands Rent before it otherwise would.</p>
    <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
      be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
      of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart
      may be made to show it: [chart]</p>
    <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in
      securing more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force,
      a rush is made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is
      wanted, but to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets
      as soon as growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration,
      suppose that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the
      third are thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
    <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is
      no increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for
      higher prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots
      in the moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let
      more land be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance.
      The new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or
      rent from owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the
      same in any case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would
      get more than 1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent,
      either directly in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus:
      [chart]</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or
          continuous payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But
          actual or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized
          for the purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling
          value that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
          will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
          is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the
          capitalization of its present or prospective power of producing Rent.
          In fact, much the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value
          is wholly or partly unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than
          it would if fully used. This condition is expressed in the chart by
          the blue color.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial
          'discounted' value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford,
          allowance being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including
          those of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth,
          its capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
          material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
          Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
          number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain

          equal, it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
          are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
          afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality
          inhering in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession
          of a thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or
          for its use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is
          purely relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining
          things for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value,
          for nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying
          some physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or
          whim. But utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves
          the reason of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things
          having some form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable,
          as they are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see
          that with most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease
          of getting them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor
          which must be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into
          the place, form and condition in which they are desired. . . Value
          is simply an expression of the labor required for the production of
          such a thing. But there are some things as to which this is not so
          clear. Land is not produced by labor, yet land, irrespective of any
          improvements that labor has made on it, often has value. . . Yet a
          little examination will show that such facts are but exemplifications
          of the general principle, just as the rise of a balloon and the fall
          of a stone both exemplify the universal law of gravitation. . . The
          value of everything produced by labor, from a pound of chalk or a paper
          of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances of a first-class
          ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent of the
          labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while the
          value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
          of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
          labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
          or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>

    <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
      Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
      owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
      produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
    <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
      with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
      of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
      the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
      confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
      becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if
      land were appropriated only for use.</p>
    <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have
      as yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before
      (page 73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given
      expenditure of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when
      applied to the next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest.
      Labor would not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73
      we illustrated the appropriation of land for use only, although much less
      land is actually used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth
      dangles before men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so
      as to make it more than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade
      would be taken up in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would
      be crowded out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which
      in consequence of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest
      closed space originally yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of
      labor force.102 Wages would then be reduced to the present productiveness
      of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>

          have so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man,

      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard

            a drink, pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse
            vast areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land
            can be had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
      that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
      of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
      neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may
      increase, so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers
      would continually be pushed back to land which increased productive power
      would have brought up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition
      for work would so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure
      of labor force, however much it produced, could nowhere secure more than
      1 in Wages.103 And this tendency would persist until some labor was forced
      upon land which, despite increase in productive power, would not yield
      the accustomed living without increase of labor force. Competition for
      work would then compel all laborers to increase their expenditure of labor
      force, and to do it over and over again as progress went on and lower and
      lower grades of land were monopolized, until human endurance could go no
      further.104 Either that, or they would be obliged to adapt themselves to
      a lower scale of living.105</p>

      <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
          ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
          implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do
          not increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers,
          but that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
          paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
          is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
          in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
          the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies,
          cannot limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed
          quantity, which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but
          there is nevertheless a limit to the price of land, in the minimum
          required by labor and capital as the condition of engaging in production.
          If it were possible to continuously reduce wages until zero were reached,
          it would be possible to continuously increase rent until it swallowed
          up the whole produce. But as wages cannot be permanently reduced below
          the point at which laborers will consent to work and reproduce, nor
          interest below the point at which capital will be devoted to production,
          there is a limit which restrains the speculative advance of rent. Hence,
          speculation cannot have the same scope to advance rent in countries
          where wages and interest are already near the minimum, as in countries
          where they are considerably above it. Yet that there is in all progressive
          countries a constant tendency in the speculative advance of rent to
          overpass the limit where production would cease, is, I think, shown
          by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress

    <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
      are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing
      unused land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry.
      Thus increase of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression
      of Rent, co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But
      no sooner do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land
      set in, Rent rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly
      reappear. The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent
      higher and Wages lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>

          between land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v,

      <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a
          point at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there
          is a downward tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which
          is the same thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades
          of laborers. This tendency continues until the fictitious values of
          land give way. So long as the tendency is felt only by that class which
          is hired for wages, it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is
          felt by the class of labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business
          interests of the country,&quot; it is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard
          times&quot; are periodical because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good
          times&quot; to set it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard
          times&quot; on again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome,

    <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
      from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
      is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
      continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should,
      actually generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of
      productive power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated,
      tend to even greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues:
      for individuals suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.<font size="+1"><strong>      ...</strong></font></p>
    <p><em>Q18. How would you reach the bondholder, or the man with money alone?</em><br>
      A. Why should we wish to reach him if his bonds or his money represent
        labor products to which he has honestly acquired a just title? This question
        is a legitimate offspring of the plundering theory that men should be
        taxed according to their ability to pay, the merits of which are considered
        on pages 7-9. It is a question which may also have been suggested by
        the fact that &quot;bondholders&quot; and &quot;men of money&quot; are
        so often men who have special privileges which coin money for them. There
        is a feeling that it would be unfair to allow such special privileges
        to escape taxation. It would be. But inquiry will show that the most
        important of these privileges rest in the ownership of land, and that
        the &quot;bondholders&quot; and &quot;men of money&quot; whom the questioner
        probably has in mind, are in fact great landlords; that is to say, that
        their fortunes are really based upon land. When land values were taxed,
        the great source of unearned incomes &#8212; land monopoly &#8212; would
        be practically abolished, and bondholders and men of money would be only
        those who earn what they have. Such property no man of honest instincts
        should wish to expropriate. </p>
    <p><em>Q35. What would be the effect of the single tax if you still left
        railroad, telegraph, money, and other monopolies in private hands?</em><br>
A. The real strength of all monopolies is in land monopoly. Observe, for example,
the land holdings of the inside ring of such railroads as the Southern Pacific,
to which the interests of the road are corruptly made subordinate. Abolish land
monopoly, and the power of all the others will go, as Sampson's strength went
with the cutting of his hair. </p>
    <p><em>Q45. What is the difference between speculation in land and in other
        kinds of property?</em><br>
A. If all the products of the world were cornered by speculators, but land were
free, new products would soon appear and the ill effects of the speculation would
quickly pass away. But if all the land were cornered by speculators, though everything
else were free, the people would immediately be dependent upon the speculators
for a chance to live. That illustrates the difference.</p>
    <p><em>Q56. Rich man with large mansion; poor widow with small house on same
        sized lot adjoining. The two pay the same tax. Is that right?</em><br>
A. There is no reason in justice why the community should not charge poor widows
as much for monopolizing valuable land as it charges rich men. In either case
it confers a special privilege and should be paid what the privilege is worth.
The question is seldom asked in good faith. Poor widows who live on lots adjoining
large mansions are not numerous, and when they exist they are simply land-grabbers.
In our sympathy for these widows, let us not forget the vast armies of widows
who not only do not live next to mansions, but have no place in the whole wide
world upon which to rest. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

        <small>Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes me. I reflect that there is no

        free they would still have to look to me for work somehow. So one day
        I announce to them that they are all free, intimating at the same

        as we may mutually and independently agree.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Most of them think they would like to have a piece of land and

        <br>
        <small>"But," softly I observe, "you are going too fast. Your proposals
        about the tools and seed and your maintenance are all right enough,
        but the land, you remember, belongs to me. You cannot expect me to
        give you your liberty and my own land for nothing. That would not be
        reasonable, would it?"&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Still I am ready to do what I promised &#8211; "to employ as many

        agree." <strong>... </strong></small><br>
        <br>
        <small>At once a number volunteered their services at such wages as
        their
        imagination had been picturing to them. I tell the ninety whose
        demands are most reasonable to stand on one side. The remaining ten
        look blank, and seeing that since I won't let them have any of the
        land, it is a question of hired employment or starvation, they offer
        to come for a little less than the others. </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>But, meanwhile, I have been making a little calculation in my
        head, and have reckoned up what the cost of keeping a slave, with his
        food and clothes, and a trifle over to keep him contented, would come
        to, and I offer that. They won&#8217;t hear of it, but as I know they
        can&#8217;t help themselves, I say nothing, and presently first one
        and then another gives in, till I have got my ninety, and still there

        him the use of the land that prevents him from acquiring capital. All
        the capital he wants to begin with is an axe and a spade, which a
        week&#8217;s earnings would buy him, and for his maintenance during
        the first year, and at any subsequent time, he could work for me or

        increment </span>Fancy comparing these healthy processes with the
        enrichment which comes
        to the landlord who happens to own a plot of land on the outskirts or
        at the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the busy
        population around him making the city larger, richer, more convenient,
        more famous every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing.
        Roads are made, streets are made, railway
        services are improved, electric light turns night into day, electric
        trams glide swiftly to and fro, water is brought from reservoirs a
        hundred miles off in the mountains -- and all the while the landlord
        sits still. Every one of those improvements is effected by the labour
        and at the cost of other people. Many of the most important are
        effected at the cost of the municipality and of the ratepayers. To not
        one of those improvements does the
        land monopolist as a land monopolist contribute, and yet by every one
        of them the value of his land is sensibly enhanced. He renders
        no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general
        welfare; he contributes nothing even to the process from which his own
        enrichment is derived. If the land were occupied by shops or by
        dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon them
        in aid of the general fund, but the land may be unoccupied,
        undeveloped, it may be what is called '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ripening</span>'
        -- ripening at the expense of the whole city, of the whole country, for
        the unearned increment of its owner. Roads perhaps may have to be
        diverted to avoid this forbidden area. The merchant going to his
        office, the artisan going to his work, have to make a detour or pay a
        tram fare to avoid it. The citizens are losing their chance of
        developing the land, the city is losing its rates, the State is losing
        its taxes which would have accrued if the natural development had taken
        place; and that share has to be replaced at the expense of the other
        ratepayers and taxpayers, and the nation as a whole is losing in the
        competition of the world -- the hard and growing competition of the
        world -- both in time and money. <span style="font-weight: bold;">And
        all the while the land monopolist
        has only to sit still and watch complacently his property multiplying
        in value, sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on
        his part; and that is justice!</span></small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unearned increment
        reaped in exact proportion to the disservice done. </span>But let us
        follow the process a little further. The population of the
        city grows and grows still larger year by year, the congestion in the
        poorer quarters becomes acute, rents and rates rise hand in hand, and
        thousands of families are crowded into one-roomed tenements. There are
        120,000 persons living in one-roomed tenements in Glasgow alone at the
        present time. At last the land becomes ripe for sale -- that means that
        the price is too tempting to be resisted any longer -- and then, and
        not till then, it is sold by the yard or by the inch at ten times, or
        twenty times, or even fifty times, its agricultural value, on which
        alone hitherto it has been rated for the public service. The greater
        the population around the land, the greater the injury which they have
        sustained by its protracted denial, the more inconvenience which has
        been caused to everybody, the more serious the loss in economic
        strength and activity, the larger will be the profit of the landlord
        when the sale is finally accomplished. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In
        fact, you may say that the
        unearned increment on the land is on all fours with the profit gathered
        by one of those American speculators who engineer a corner in corn, or
        meat, or cotton, or some other vital commodity, and that the unearned
        increment in land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion,
        not to the service but to the disservice done. ...</span></small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax on capital value of
        undeveloped land</span>&nbsp; But there is another proposal concerning
        land values which is not less
        important. I mean the tax on the capital value of undeveloped urban or
        suburban land. The income derived from land and its rateable value
        under the present law depend upon the use to which the land is put,
        consequently income and rateable value are not always true or complete
        measures of the value of the land. Take the case to which I have
        already referred of the man who keeps a large plot in or near a growing
        town idle for years while it is ripening -- that is to say, while it is
        rising in price through the exertions of the surrounding community and
        the need of that community for more room to live. Take that case. I
        daresay you have formed your own opinion upon it. Mr Balfour, Lord
        Lansdowne, and the Conservative Party generally, think that is an
        admirable arrangement. <strong>T</strong><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">hey speak of
        the profits of the land monopolist
        as if they were the fruits of thrift and industry and a pleasing
        example for the poorer classes to imitate. </span>We do not take that
        view of
        the process. We think it is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">dog-in-the-manger</span>
        game. We see the evil, we see the imposture upon the public, and we see
        the consequences in crowded slums, in hampered commerce, in distorted
        or restricted development, and in congested centres of population, and
        we say here and now to the land monopolist who is holding up his land
        -- and the pity is it was not said before -- you shall judge for
        yourselves whether it is a fair offer or not. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We say to the land monopolist: 'This
        property of yours might be put to immediate use with general advantage.
        It is at this minute saleable in the market at ten times the value at
        which it is rated. If you choose to keep it idle in the expectation of
        still further unearned increment, then at least you shall he taxed at
        the true selling value in the meanwhile.' </span>And the Budget
        proposes a tax of a halfpenny in the pound on the capital value of all
        such land; that is to say, a tax which is a little less in equivalent
        than the income tax would be upon the property if the property were
        fully developed. That is the second main proposal of the Budget with
        regard to the land, and its effects will be, </small></div>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Two-factor economics, however,
        had advantages to influential
        individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
        positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
        increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
        quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
        parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
        their value, one could quickly turn a profit. This is because the
        increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
        were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. In
        three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
        and efficient manner. When a railroad magnate like George Leland
        Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
        Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
        needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
        a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
        the line. <span style="font-weight: bold;">All across America, land
        speculators learned that capturing
        monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
        turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.</span></small><small>... <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Hence it becomes important,
        critically important, to understand the
        meaning of &#8220;ownership&#8221; and &#8220;property&#8221; in the Georgist lexicon. But it
        is not difficult, for they continue to have their classical meanings,
        just as for John Locke, Adam Smith, and all the major forerunners and
        thinkers of classical economics until the advent of neoclassical
        economics. What was the meaning of ownership and property in their
        classical sense? Property was the product of human labor and capital,
        and that alone. Items of property were household goods, personal
        attire, armaments, and similar such goods. Property belonged in the
        category of capital. Land was not part of property, but rather was its
        own category. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land, broadly defined,
        belonged to everyone and was the common heritage of all humanity.</span><small

        of ownership that people often use today.</span> Much like the
        native-American concept of ownership, it was part of what was

        be the earth, for the land is our mother, nourishing all her children,
        beasts, birds, fish, and all men. The woods, the streams, everything on
        it belongs to everybody and is for the use of all. How can one man say

    <p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
        Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Georgist analysis strongly emphasises landownership as a principal source
        of inequality. Because land is a strictly limited resource, its private
        ownership necessarily excludes large sections of the community from its
        benefits. A landowning class thereby gains political economic power.
        In George&#8217;s own time the social identity and power of this landowning
        class was distinctive. Those who could not afford to buy land were forced
        to pay rent to the wealthier few who could. By taxing the value of land,
        George posited that publicly created wealth could be recouped from the
        private landowners and redistributed throughout the community more equitably
        in order to address social goals.</p>
      <p>Are George&#8217;s arguments about land ownership and wealth inequality
        relevant today? Australia provides an interesting example, because land
        is the single largest item in national wealth. Laurie Aarons outlines
        the concentration of farming land in particular in the hands of a few
        very wealthy corporations and individuals &#8211; what he refers to as &#8216;corporate
        squattocracy&#8217; (Aarons, 1999: 23). The relentless increase in urban
        land values in recent years has also produced dramatic redistributions
        of wealth. In the State of New South Wales, for example, land values
        increased by about $361 billion over the period 1993 &#8211; 2003. The
        existing land-based taxes clawed back only $44 billion in government
        revenues, comprising only about 12% of the land-related economic surplus.
        So 88% was retained as &#8216;unearned income&#8217; by landowners (Stilwell
        and Jordan, forthcoming). A higher rate of land tax with fewer exemptions
        could have substantially reduced this private wealth appropriation. This
        is not necessarily to posit the desirability of recouping 100% through
        land tax, because that would certainly raise major problems of people&#8217;s
        ability to pay, given that much of the increased wealth resulting from
        land price inflation has not been realised as current income. But it
        is indicative of the current imbalance between private and public appropriations
        of the surplus arising from increases in land-based wealth.</p>
      <p>However, it is also pertinent to note that land ownership today is significantly
        less concentrated than in George&#8217;s time, with around 70% of Australians
        being home-owners (including those in the process of purchasing their
        homes with mortgage finance). According to the recent Household, Income
        and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, home-ownership is unevenly
        distributed between income groups, with 56% of households in the lowest
        income quintile owning their own homes, compared to 85% of those in the
        highest quintile (Kohler et al, 2004: 10). But this distributional inequality
        is significantly less marked than the ownership of other assets, such
        as shares for example. Of course, most land ownership for residential
        purposes involves very small tracts, typically only about one-sixth of
        an acre in the suburban areas of the major cities. Flat-owners, growing
        annually as a proportion of the population, usually own less land and
        do so more indirectly through strata property titles. So the form of
        land tax (that is, whether flat rate or on a progressive scale, whether
        applying to all land or only that above a &#8216;threshold&#8217; value,
        or exempting owner-occupied property) becomes crucial to its effectiveness
        as a mechanism for tackling distributional inequality. It is also crucial
        to the political acceptability of land tax reform.</p>
      <p>In addition, it is apparent in modern economies that not all socioeconomic
        inequalities stem from the unequal capture of the economic surplus associated
        with land. Inequalities are also generated by unequal access to capital,
        educational and employment opportunities. These inequalities are imperfectly
        correlated with wealth deriving from land ownership. Hence, additional
        means of redress are needed, as J. K. Galbraith and other institutional
        economists have consistently argued (e.g. see Galbraith, 1992; 2002:
        chapter 3). For example, &#8216;floors,&#8217; such as minimum wage requirements
        and &#8216;social security&#8217; payments, must be provided to guarantee
        a minimum income to all members of society, including those excluded
        from the production process. A strong, albeit unfashionable, case can
        also be made for &#8216;ceilings&#8217; to limit excessive salaries,
        such as those of some top corporate executives, which far outweigh their
        productive contributions to society. The average executive remuneration
        levels in major Australian companies increased from 22 times average
        weekly earnings to 74 times average weekly earnings in the period 1992-2002
        (Shields et al, 2003: iii). It may be, as George argued, that &#8216;the
        increase of land values is always at the expense of the value of labour&#8217; (George,
        1966: 224) but the complex distributions of income received by capital
        and labour are not readily explicable in terms of an analysis focusing
        exclusively on land. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Von's</span> now holds 360 grocery stores
            in California (after acquiring 172 Safeway stores). Such large chain landholdings
            tend to lessen competition, it is widely feared [L.A. Times, 28 May 88].
            Congressmen who shop in Washington, D.C. know this first-hand. Washington
            food prices are conspicuously high, where Safeway is one of just two chains
            (the other is Giant).<br>
        <br>
        Some of the acquired stores are probably on leased sites, which would help account
        for the low price of the Safeway acquisition, averaging $2.4 million per store.
        Long-term leaseholds often acquire some value of their own when the remaining
        years' payments are below the market;
        but not as high as fee simple titles.</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Update, 1993. Von's, Southern Cal's biggest
            grocer, is gobbling up 53 leases released by Builders' Emporium "in a shut-out
            strategy against competitors." Von's is doing this by negotiating with Builders'
            Emporium itself, Irvine. The buildings are 40,000 sf to 90,000 sf, the right
            size for supermarkets, and are of course complete with vast parking lots
            in the requisite 5/1 ratio. Von's will convert 6-8 to markets, and "hold
            onto the others until commercial rents rebound - then market them to non-rivals." (TPE
            15 Oct 93 C7) Salamon Bros. analyst Jonathan Ziegler praises this as "ingenious." "You're
            controlling who's in your market area." Ralphs had been looking, is shut
            out. (This may be "ingenious" for Von's, but is a zero-sum game with Ralph's,
            and a net loss for the market economy. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Land is held idle simply to suppress competition:
          a clear case of market failure.</span>)</div>

          <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Update, 1994. Vons has about 19% of the Southern
            California market; Lucky and Ralphs both have 14%. Vons, based in Arcadia,
            has 331 stores in Southern California, including some called Pavilions, Tianguis,
            and EXPO. Also, 15 in Las Vegas. (LAT 26 Apr 94 D1)<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alpha Beta</span>. Owner of Alpha Beta (131
          stores) is Yucaipa Company, which also owns the Boys (24 stores) and Viva (15
          stores) chains, and Food 4 Less warehouse stores. All these are operated by
          Food 4 Less Supermarkets, La Habra. (Food 4 Less has been the only chain willing
          to serve South Central LA, and other communities with large minority populations.)
          Their value is estimated
        at $1 billion.<br>
        <br>
        Former owner of Alpha Beta was, L.S. Skaggs, chairman of American Stores, Salt
        Lake City. Alpha Beta lost market share by failing to replace stores built in
        the 1960s. These became too small. It was preoccupied with its stores elsewhere,
        and allowed Alpha Beta to lose
        market share.<br>
        <br>
        In 1988, American Stores merged with Lucky Stores. It has 439 grocery stores
        in California and Las Vegas, but only 222 in Southern California. But in combination
        with Alpha Beta units, there would have been 370 stores in southern California
        alone. Its Lucky unit is based in Dublin, CA. It operates 1695 stores in 27 states,
        including the Sav-on unit, based in Anaheim. After anti-trust suits, it kept
        the Lucky stores in Northern California and put Lucky in charge of its new Alpha
        Beta stores. However, in Southern California. FTC blocked the purchase, so it
        sold 145 stores in southland to Yucaipa Co. (What happened to the excess of 145
        over 131? - 14 stores closed, or sold?)<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Grocery stores in auto-oriented Southern California
        require perhaps a 6/1 ratio of parking to floor
        space, so these "stores" are mainly landholdings. 360 stores at 5 acres each
        (estimated) would come to 1800 acres: a large figure when we consider it is all
        good retail space.</span><br>
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ralph's grocery</span>, 129 stores run from
        Compton, California, is held by Federated Dept. Stores, a Cincinnati-based chain,
        owned by De Bartolo plus other shareholders. It was acquired by Robert Campeau
        of Toronto, who was taking offers in 1988. Bidding was around $1 billion, or
        $7.8 million per store, much
        higher than the Safeway price.<br>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Update, 9/94. George White, "Alpha Beta and Ralph's
          Merger Expected Soon." LAT 12 Sept., p.1. Ralph's (167 stores) and Alpha Beta
          (131 stores) expected to announce merger soon. Would then be larger than Von's.
          Von's has 19% of Southern California market; new merger would have 27%. The
          name Alpha Beta would be retired. Ralph's would be selling to Yucaipa. Payment
          would be $500 million, plus assuming debt of $1 billion. Thus, assets of new
          merger would be $2.5 billion.</div>
        <br>
        From 10 to 30 of the Ralph's stores, and many of the Alpha Beta stores would
        be converted to Food 4 Less warehouse stores. Some stores would be closed, and
        people laid off. ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_WOSC97.html">read the whole article
