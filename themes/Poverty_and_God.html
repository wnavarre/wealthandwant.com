<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Though it may take the language
of prayer, it is blasphemy that
attributes to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering
and brutishness that come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to
the All-Father and lays on Him the responsibility for the want and
crime of our great cities. We degrade the Everlasting. We slander the
Just One. A merciful man would have better ordered the world; a just
man would crush with his foot such an ulcerous ant-hill! It is not
the Almighty, but we who are responsible for the vice and misery that
fester amid our civilization. The Creator showers upon us his
gifts &#8212; more than enough for all. But like swine scrambling for
food, we tread them in the mire &#8212; tread them in the mire, while we
tear and rend each other!</small><br>
<br>
<small> In the very centers of our civilization today are want and
suffering enough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his
eyes and steel his nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to
relieve it? Supposing the prayer were heard, and at the behest with
which the universe sprang into being there should glow in the sun a
greater power; new virtue fill the air; fresh vigor the soil; that
for every blade of grass that now grows two should spring up, and the
seed that now increases fifty-fold should increase a hundredfold!
Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever
benefit would accrue would be but temporary. The new powers streaming
through the material universe could be utilized only through land.
And land, being private property, the classes that now monopolize the
bounty of the Creator would monopolize all the new bounty. Land
owners would alone be benefited. Rents would increase, but wages
would still tend to the starvation point! </small><br>
<br>
<small> This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a
fact of experience. We know it because we have seen it. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It is this that turns the
blessings of material progress into a
curse. It is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and
squalid tenement houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads
men with want and consumes them with greed; that robs women of the
grace and beauty of perfect womanhood; that takes from little
children the joy and innocence of life&#8217;s morning. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Civilization so based cannot
continue. The eternal laws of the
universe forbid it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness
that is in every soul answers, that it cannot be. It is something
grander than Benevolence, something more august than Charity &#8212; it
is Justice herself that demands of us to right this wrong. Justice
that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice that
with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with
liturgies and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by
raising churches when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep?

Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...Whose fault is it that social
conditions are such that men have to make that terrible choice between
what conscience tells them is right, and the necessity of earning a
living? I hold that it is the fault of society; that it is the fault of
us all. Pestilence is a curse. The man who would bring cholera to this
country, or the man who, having the power to prevent its coming here,
would make no effort to do so, would be guilty of a crime. Poverty is
worse than cholera; poverty kills more people than pestilence, even in
the best of times. Look at the death statistics of our cities; see
where the deaths come quickest; see where it is that the little
children die like flies &#8211; it is in the poorer quarters. And the man who
looks with careless eyes upon the ravages of this pestilence, the man
who does not set himself to stay and eradicate it, he, I say, is guilty
of a crime.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If poverty is appointed by the
power which is above us all, then it is no crime; but if poverty is
unnecessary, then it is a crime for which society is responsible and
for which society must suffer.</span> I hold, and I think no one who
looks at the facts can fail to see, that poverty is utterly
unnecessary. It is not by the decree of the Almighty, but it is because
of our own injustice, our own selfishness, our own ignorance, that this
scourge, worse than any pestilence, ravages our civilisation, bringing
want and suffering and degradation, destroying souls as well as bodies.
Look over the world, in this heyday of nineteenth century civilisation.
In every civilised country under the sun you will find men and women
whose condition is worse than that of the savage: men and women and
little children with whom the veriest savage could not afford to
exchange. Even in this new city of yours with virgin soil around you,
you have had this winter to institute a relief society. Your roads have
been filled with tramps, fifteen, I am told, at one time taking shelter
in a round-house here. As here, so everywhere; and poverty is deepest
where wealth most abounds. </small><br>
<br>
<small> What more unnatural than this? There is nothing in nature like
this poverty which today curses us. We see rapine in nature; we see
one species destroying another; but as a general thing animals do not
feed on their own kind; and, wherever we see one kind enjoying
plenty, all creatures of that kind share it. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">No man, I think, ever
saw a herd of buffalo, of which a few were fat and the great majority
lean. No man ever saw a flock of birds, of which two or three were
swimming in grease and the others all skin and bone.</span> Nor in
savage
life is there anything like the poverty that festers in our
civilisation. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>... Men are compelled to compete
with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been
robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves; because
they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
paying some other human creature for the privilege. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I do not mean to say that even
after you had set right this
fundamental injustice, there would not be many things to do; but this
I do mean to say, that our treatment of land lies at the bottom of
all social questions. This I do mean to say, that, do what you
please, reform as you may, <b>you never can get rid of wide-spread
poverty so long as the element on which and from which all men must
live is made the private property of some men. </b>It is utterly
impossible. Reform government &#8212; get taxes down to the
minimum &#8212; build railroads; institute co-operative stores; divide
profits, if you choose, between employers and employed -- and what will
be the result? <b>The result will be that the land will increase in
value &#8212; that will be the result &#8212; that and nothing else.
Experience shows this. Do not all improvements simply increase the
value of land &#8212; the price that some must pay others for the
privilege of living? </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Consider the matter, I say it
with all reverence, and I merely
say it because I wish to impress a truth upon your minds &#8212; it is
utterly impossible, so long as His laws are what they are, that God
himself could relieve poverty &#8212; utterly impossible. Think of it
and you will see. Men pray to the Almighty to relieve poverty.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> But
poverty comes not from God's laws &#8212; it is blasphemy of the worst
kind to say that; it comes from man's injustice to his fellows.</span>
Supposing the Almighty were to hear the prayer, how could He carry
out the request so long as His laws are what they are? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Consider -- the Almighty gives us
nothing of the things that
constitute wealth; He merely gives us the raw material, which must be
utilised by man to produce wealth. Does He not give us enough of that
now? <span style="font-weight: bold;">How could He relieve poverty
even if He were to give us more?</span>
Supposing in answer to these prayers He were to increase the power of
the sun; or the virtue of the soil? Supposing He were to make plants
more prolific, or animals to produce after their kind more
abundantly? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Who would get the benefit
of it? </span>Take a country where
land is completely monopolised, as it is in most of the civilised
countries &#8212; who would get the benefit of it? Simply the
landowners. And even if God in answer to prayer were to send down out
of the heavens those things that men require, who would get the
benefit?&nbsp; ... <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/the_crime_of_poverty.html"><span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy Kingdom Come</a>
(1889 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have just joined in the most
solemn, the most sacred, the most
catholic of all prayers: &#8220;Our Father which art in Heaven!&#8221;
To all of us who have learned it in our infancy, it oft calls up the
sweetest and most tender emotions. Sometimes with feeling, sometimes
as a matter of course, how often have we repeated it? For centuries,
daily, hourly, has that prayer gone up. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; Has it come?
Let this Christian
city of Glasgow answer &#8212; Glasgow, that was to &#8220;Flourish by
the preaching of the word&#8221;. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; Day after
day, Sunday after
Sunday, week after week, century after century, has that prayer gone
up; and today, in this so-called Christian city of Glasgow, 125,000
human beings &#8212; so your medical officer says &#8212; 125,000
children of God are living whole families in a single room. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; We have been
praying for it and
praying for it, yet it has not come. So long has it tarried that many
think it will never come. Here is the vital point in which what we
are accustomed to call the Christianity of the present day differs so
much from that Christianity which overran the ancient world &#8212;
that Christianity which, beneath a rotten old civilisation, planted
the seeds of a newer and a higher. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We have become accustomed to
think that God&#8217;s kingdom, is
not intended for this world; that, virtually, this is the
devil&#8217;s world, and that God&#8217;s kingdom is in some other
sphere, to which He is to take good people when they die &#8212; as
good Americans are said when they die to go to Paris. If that be so,
what is the use of praying for the coming of the kingdom? Is God the
loving Father of whom Christ told &#8212; is He a God of that kind; a
God who looks on this world, sees its sufferings and its miseries,
sees high faculties aborted, lives stunted, innocence turned to vice
and crime, and heartstrings strained and broken, yet, having it in
His power, will not bring that kingdom of peace, and love, and plenty
and happiness? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Is God indeed a
self-willed despot, whom we must coax
to do the good He might?</span> </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Think of it. The Almighty &#8212; and
I say it with reverence
&#8212; the Almighty could not bring that kingdom of Himself. For,
what is the kingdom of God; the kingdom that Christ taught us to pray
for? Is it not in the doing of God&#8217;s will, not by automata, not
by animals who are compelled, but by intelligent beings clothed with
free will, intelligent beings knowing good from evil?<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; When Christ
taught that prayer He
did not mean that humans should idly phrase these words, but that for
the coming of that kingdom humanity must work as well as pray! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Prayer! Consider what prayer is.
How true is the old fable! The
wagoner whose wagon was stuck in the rut knelt down and prayed to
Jove to get it out. He might have prayed till the crack of doom, and
the wagon would have stood there. This world &#8212; God&#8217;s world
&#8212; is not a world in which the repeating of words will get wagons
out of mire or poverty out of slums. We who would pray with effect
must work!<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Our Father!&#8221; &#8220;Our Father!&#8221;
Whose? Not <span style="font-style: italic;">my
</span>Father &#8212; that is not the prayer. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Our </span>Father&#8221; &#8212;
not the father of any sect, or any class, but the Father of all
humanity. The All-Father, the equal Father, the loving Father. He it
is we ask to bring the kingdom. Aye, we ask it with our lips! We call
Him &#8220;Our Father,&#8221; the All, the Universal Father, when we
kneel down to pray to Him. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that He is the All-Father &#8212;
that He is all
people&#8217;s Father &#8212; we deny by our institutions. The
All-Father who made the world, the All-Father who created us in His
image, and put us upon the earth to draw subsistence from its bosom;
to find in the earth all the materials that satisfy our wants,
waiting only to be worked up by our labour! If He is the All-Father,
then are not all human beings, all children of the Creator, equally
entitled to the use of His bounty? And, yet, our laws say that this
God&#8217;s earth is not here for the use of all His children, but
only for the use of a privileged few! <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of what Christianity
teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Better to me, higher to me, is
the atheist, who says there is no
God, than the professed Christian who, prating of the goodness and
the Fatherhood of God, tells us in words as some do, or tells us
indirectly as others do, that millions and millions of human
creatures &#8212; [at this point a child was heard crying]
&#8212; don&#8217;t take the little thing out &#8212; that millions and
millions of human beings, like that little baby, are being brought
into the world daily by the creative fiat, and no place in this world
provided for them. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Aye! Tells us that, by the laws
of God, the poor are created in
order that the rich may have the unctuous satisfaction of dealing out
charity to them, and attributes to the laws of God the state of
things which exists in this city of Glasgow, as in other great cities
on both sides of the Atlantic, where little children are dying every
day, dying by hundreds of thousands, because having come into this
world &#8212; those children of God, with His fiat, by His decree
&#8212; they find that there is not space on the earth sufficient for
them to live; and are driven out of God&#8217;s world because they
cannot get room enough, cannot get air enough, cannot get sustenance
enough.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What God gives are the natural
elements that are indispensable
to labour. He gives them, not to one, not to some, not to one
generation, but to all. They are His gifts, His bounty to the whole
human race. And yet in all our civilised countries what do we see?
That a few people have appropriated these bounties, claiming them as
theirs alone, while the great majority have no legal right to apply
their labour to the reservoirs of Nature and draw from the
Creator&#8217;s bounty. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Thus it happens that all over the
civilised world that class
that is called peculiarly &#8216;the labouring class&#8217; is the poor
class, and that people who do no labour, who pride themselves on
never having done honest labour, and on being descended from fathers
and grandfathers who never did a stroke of honest labour in their
lives, revel in a superabundance of the things that labour brings
forth.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Mr Abner Thomas, of New York, a
strict orthodox Presbyterian
&#8212; and the son of Rev Dr Thomas, author of a commentary on the
bible &#8212;wrote a little while ago an allegory. Dozing off in his
chair, he dreamt that he was ferried over the River of Death, and,
taking the straight and narrow way, came at last within sight of the
Golden City. A fine-looking old gentleman angel opened the wicket,
inquired his name, and let him in; warning him, at the same time,
that it would be better if he chose his company in heaven, and did
not associate with disreputable angels. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What!&#8221; said the newcomer, in
astonishment: &#8220;Is
not this heaven?&#8221;<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The story goes on to describe how
the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
&#8220;Thy kingdom come.&#8221; No one can think of the kingdom
for which the prayer asks without feeling that it must be a kingdom
of justice and equality &#8212; not necessarily of equality in
condition, but of equality in opportunity.</span> And no one can think
of it
without seeing that a very kingdom of God might be brought on this
earth if people would but seek to do justice &#8212; if people would
but acknowledge the essential principle of Christianity, that of
doing to others as we would have others do to us, and of recognising
that we are all here equally the children of the one Father, equally
entitled to share His bounty, equally entitled to live our lives and
develop our faculties, and to apply our labour to the raw material
that He has provided. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Nothing is clearer than that if
we are all children of the
universal Father, we are all entitled to the use of His bounty. No
one dare deny that proposition. But the people who set their faces
against its carrying out say, virtually: &#8220;Oh, yes! that is true;
but it is impracticable to carry it into effect!&#8221; Just think of
what this means. This is God&#8217;s world, and yet such people say
that it is a world in which God&#8217;s justice, God&#8217;s will,
cannot be carried into effect. What a monstrous absurdity, what a
monstrous blasphemy! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If the loving God does reign, if
His laws are the laws not
merely of the physical, but of the moral universe, there must be a
way of carrying His will into effect, there must be a way of doing
equal justice to all of His creatures.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Yet, while in looking through the
laws of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical </span>nature, we
find intelligence we do not so clearly find beneficence. But in the
great <span style="font-style: italic;">social </span>fact that as
population increases, and improvements are
made, and men progress in civilisation, the one thing that rises
everywhere in value is land, and in this we may see a proof of the
beneficence of the Creator. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider what it means! It
means that the social laws are
adapted to progressive humanity! In a rude state of society where
there is no need for common expenditure, there is no value attaching
to land. The only value which attaches there is to things produced by
labour. But as civilisation goes on, as a division of labour takes
place, as people come into centres, so do the common wants increase,
and so does the necessity for public revenue arise. And so in that
value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the
individual does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a
provision intended &#8212; we may safely say intended &#8212; to meet
that social want. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><> Just as society grows, so do
the common needs grow, and so grows
this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided fund from which they
can be supplied. Here is a value that may be taken, without impairing
the right of property, without taking anything from the producer,
without lessening the natural rewards of industry and thrift. Nay,
here is a value that must be taken if we would prevent the most
monstrous of all monopolies. What does all this mean? It means that
in the creative plan, the natural advance in civilisation is an
advance to a greater and greater equality instead of to a more and
more monstrous inequality.&nbsp; ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You assume that there are in the natural order two classes, the rich and
    the poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say that there are differences in capacity, in diligence,
    in health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
    however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor. The
    natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not greater than
    are natural differences in stature. But while it is only by selecting giants
    and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as others, yet in the difference
    between rich and poor that exists today we find some men richer than other
    men by the thousandfold and the millionfold.</p>
  <p><strong>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide with differences
    in individual powers and aptitudes. The real difference between rich and
    poor is the difference between those who hold the tollgates and those who
    pay toll; between tribute-receivers and tribute-yielders.</strong></p>
  <p>In what way does nature justify such a difference? In the numberless varieties
    of animated nature we find some species that are evidently intended to live
    on other species. But their relations are always marked by unmistakable differences
    in size, shape or organs. To man has been given dominion over all the other
    living things that tenant the earth. But is not this mastery indicated even
    in externals, so that no one can fail on sight to distinguish between a man
    and one of the inferior animals? Our American apologists for slavery used
    to contend that the black skin and woolly hair of the negro indicated the
    intent of nature that the black should serve the white; but the difference
    that you assume to be natural is between men of the same race. <strong>What
    difference does nature show between such men as would indicate her intent
    that one should
    live idly yet be rich, and the other should work hard yet be poor? </strong>If I could
    bring you from the United States a man who has $200,000,000, and one who
    is glad to work for a few dollars a week, and place them side by side in
    your antechamber, would you be able to tell which was which, even were you
    to call in the most skilled anatomist? <strong>Is it not clear that God in
    no way countenances or condones the division of rich and poor that exists
    today,
    or in any way permits it, except as having given them free will he permits
    men to choose either good or evil, and to avoid heaven if they prefer hell.
    For is it not clear that the division of men into the classes rich and poor
    has invariably its origin in force and fraud; invariably involves violation
    of the moral law; and is really a division into those who get the profits
    of robbery and those who are robbed; those who hold in exclusive possession
    what God made for all, and those who are deprived of his bounty?</strong> Did not
    Christ in all his utterances and parables show that the gross difference
    between rich and poor is opposed to God&#8217;s law? Would he have condemned
    the rich so strongly as he did, if the class distinction between rich and
    poor did not involve injustice &#8212; was not opposed to God&#8217;s intent?</p>
  <p>It seems to us that your Holiness misses its real significance in intimating
    that Christ, in becoming the son of a carpenter and himself working as a
    carpenter, showed merely that &#8220;there is nothing to be ashamed of in
    seeking one&#8217;s bread by labor.&#8221; To say that is almost like saying
    that by not robbing people he showed that there is nothing to be ashamed
    of in honesty. If you will consider how true in any large view is the classification
    of all men into working-men, beggar-men and thieves, you will see that it
    was morally impossible that Christ during his stay on earth should have been
    anything else than a working-man, since he who came to fulfil the law must
    by deed as well as word obey God&#8217;s law of labor.</p>
  <p>See how fully and how beautifully Christ&#8217;s life on earth illustrated
    this law. Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as it is
    appointed that all should enter it, he lovingly took what in the natural
    order is lovingly rendered, the sustenance, secured by labor, that one generation
    owes to its immediate successors. Arrived at maturity, he earned his own
    subsistence by that common labor in which the majority of men must and do
    earn it. Then passing to a higher &#8212; to the very highest &#8212; sphere
    of labor, he earned his subsistence by the teaching of moral and spiritual
    truths, receiving its material wages in the love-offerings of grateful hearers,
    and not refusing the costly spikenard with which Mary anointed his feet.
    So, when he chose his disciples, he did not go to landowners or other monopolists
    who live on the labor of others, but to common laboring-men. And when he
    called them to a higher sphere of labor and sent them out to teach moral
    and spiritual truths, he told them to take, without condescension on the
    one hand or sense of degradation on the other, the loving return for such
    labor, saying to them that &#8220;the laborer is worthy of his hire,&#8221; thus
    showing, what we hold, that all labor does not consist in what is called
    manual labor, but that whoever helps to add to the material, intellectual,
    moral or spiritual fullness of life is also a laborer.*</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* Nor should it be forgotten that the investigator, the
        philosopher, the teacher, the artist, the poet, the priest, though not
        engaged in the
      production of wealth, are not only engaged in the production of utilities
      and satisfactions
        to which the production of wealth is only a means, but by acquiring and
      diffusing knowledge, stimulating mental powers and elevating the moral
      sense, may greatly
        increase the ability to produce wealth. For man does not live by bread
      alone. . . . He who by any exertion of mind or body adds to the aggregate
      of enjoyable
        wealth, increases the sum of human knowledge, or gives to human life
      higher elevation or greater fullness &#8212; he is, in the large meaning of the
        words, a &#8220;producer,&#8221; a &#8220;working-man,&#8221; a &#8220;laborer,&#8221; and
        is honestly earning honest wages. But he who without doing aught to make
        mankind richer, wiser, better, happier, lives on the toil of others &#8212; he,
        no matter by what name of honor he may be called, or how lustily the priests
        of Mammon may swing their censers before him, is in the last analysis but
        a beggar-man or a thief. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, pp. 74-75.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>In assuming that laborers, even ordinary manual laborers, are naturally
    poor, you ignore the fact that labor is the producer of wealth, and attribute
    to the natural law of the Creator an injustice that comes from man&#8217;s
    impious violation of his benevolent intention. In the rudest stage of the
    arts it is possible, where justice prevails, for all well men to earn a living.
    With the labor-saving appliances of our time, it should be possible for all
    to earn much more. And so, in saying that poverty is no disgrace, you convey
    an unreasonable implication. For poverty ought to be a disgrace, since in
    a condition of social justice, it would, where unsought from religious motives
    or unimposed by unavoidable misfortune, imply recklessness or laziness</strong>.
    <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Let me again state the case that your Encyclical presents:</p>
  <p>What is that condition of labor which as you truly say is &#8220;the question
    of the hour,&#8221; and &#8220;fills every mind with painful apprehension&#8221;?
    Reduced to its lowest expression it is the poverty of men willing to work.
    And what is the lowest expression of this phrase? It is that they lack bread &#8212; for
    in that one word we most concisely and strongly express all the manifold
    material satisfactions needed by humanity, the absence of which constitutes
    poverty.</p>
  <p>Now what is the prayer of Christendom &#8212; the universal prayer; the
    prayer that goes up daily and hourly wherever the name of Christ is honored;
    that ascends from your Holiness at the high altar of St. Peter&#8217;s, and
    that is repeated by the youngest child that the poorest Christian mother
    has taught to lisp a request to her Father in Heaven? It is, &#8220;Give
    us this day our daily bread!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Yet where this prayer goes up, daily and hourly, men lack bread. Is it not
    the business of religion to say why? If it cannot do so, shall not scoffers
    mock its ministers as Elias mocked the prophets of Baal, saying, &#8220;Cry
    with a louder voice, for he is a god; and perhaps he is talking, or is in
    an inn, or on a journey, or perhaps be is asleep, and must be awaked!&#8221; What
    answer can those ministers give? Either there is no God, or he is asleep,
    or else he does give men their daily bread, and it is in some way intercepted.</p>
  <p>Here is the answer, the only true answer: If men lack bread it is not that
    God has not done his part in providing it. If men willing to labor are cursed
    with poverty, it is not that the storehouse that God owes men has failed;
    that the daily supply he has promised for the daily wants of his children
    is not here in abundance. It is, that impiously violating the benevolent
    intentions of their Creator, men have made land private property, and thus
    given into the exclusive ownership of the few the provision that a bountiful
    Father has made for all.</p>
  <p>Any other answer than that, no matter how it may be shrouded in the mere
    forms of religion, is practically an atheistical answer. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  <p> OR let him go to Edinburgh, the &quot;modern Athens,&quot; of which Scotsmen
    speak with pride, and in buildings from whose roofs a bowman might strike
    the spires of twenty churches he will find human beings living as he would
    not keep his meanest dog. Let him toil up the stairs of one of those monstrous
    buildings, let him enter one of those &quot;dark houses,&quot; let him close

    (but, alas! how futile is Charity without Justice!) where little children
    are kept while their mothers are at work, and children are fed who would
    otherwise go hungry, he may see infants whose limbs are shrunken from want
    of nourishment. Perhaps they may tell him, as they told me, of that little
    girl, barefooted, ragged, and hungry, who, when they gave her bread, raised
    her eyes and clasped her hands, and thanked our Father in Heaven for His
    bounty to her. They who told me that never dreamed, I think, of its terrible
    meaning. But I ask the Duke of Argyll, did that little child, thankful for
    that poor dole, get what our Father provided for her? Is He so niggard? If
    not, what is it, who is it, that stands, between such children and our Father's
    bounty? If it be an institution, is it not our duty to God and to our neighbor
    to rest not till we destroy it? If it be a man, were it not better for him
    that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depths
    of the sea? &#8212; The Reduction to Iniquity (a reply to the Duke of Argyll),
    The Nineteenth Century, July, 1884</p>
  <p>WE are so accustomed to poverty that even in the most advanced countries
    we regard it as the natural lot of the great masses of the people; that we
    take it as a matter of course that even in our highest civilization large
    classes should want the necessaries of healthful life, and the vast majority
    should only get a poor and pinched living by the hardest toil. There are
    professors of political economy who teach that this condition of things is
    the result of social laws of which it is idle to complain! There are ministers
    of religion who preach that this is the condition which an all-wise, all-powerful
    Creator intended for His children! If an architect were to build a theater
    so that not more than one-tenth of the audience could see and hear, we should
    call him a bungler and a botcher. If a man were to give a feast and provide
    so little food that nine-tenths of his guests must go away hungry, we should
    call him a fool, or worse. Yet so accustomed are we to poverty, that even
    the preachers of what passes for Christianity tell us that the great Architect
    of the Universe, to whose infinite skill all nature testifies, has made such
    a botch job of this world that the vast majority of the human creatures whom
    He has called into it are condemned by the conditions he has imposed to want,
    suffering, and brutalizing toil that gives no opportunity for the development
    of mental powers &#8212; must pass their lives in a hard struggle to merely
    live! &#8212; Social Problems </p>
  <p>&quot;THE poor ye have always with you.&quot; If ever a scripture has been
    wrested to the devil's service, this is that scripture. How often have these
    words been distorted from their obvious meaning to soothe conscience into
    acquiescence in human misery and degradation &#8212; to bolster that blasphemy,
    the very negation and denial of Christ's teachings, that the All Wise and
    Most Merciful, the Infinite Father, has decreed that so many of His creatures
    must be poor in order that others of His creatures to whom He wills the good
    things of life should enjoy the please and virtue of doling out alms! &quot;The
    poor ye have always with you,&quot; said Christ; but all His teachings supply
    the limitation, &quot;until the coming of the Kingdom.&quot; In that kingdom
    of God on earth, that kingdom of justice and love for which He taught His
    followers to strive and pray, there will be no poor. &#8212; Social Problems &#8212; Chapter
    8: That We All Might Be Rich.</p>
  <p>WE naturally despise poverty; and it is reasonable that we should. I do
    not say &#8212; I distinctly repudiate it &#8212; that the people who are
    poor are poor always from their own fault, or even in most cases; but it
    ought to be so. If any good man or woman had the power to create a world,
    it would be a sort of a world in which no one would be poor unless he was
    lazy or vicious. But that is just precisely the kind of a world that this
    is; that is just precisely, the kind of a world that the Creator has made.
    Nature gives to labor, and to labor alone; there must be human work before
    any article of wealth can be produced; and, in a natural state of things,
    the man who toiled honestly and well would be the rich man, and he who did
    not work would be poor. We have so reversed the order of nature, that we
    are accustomed to think of a working-man as a poor man. &#8212; The Crime
    of Poverty </p>
  <p> THAT justice is the highest quality in the moral hierarchy I do not say;
    but that it is the first. That which is above justice must be based on justice,
    and include justice, and be reached through justice. It is not by accident
    that, in the Hebraic religious development which through Christianity we
    have inherited, the declaration, &quot;The Lord thy God is a just God,&quot; precedes
    the sweeter revelation of a God of Love. Until the eternal justice is perceived,
    the eternal love must be hidden. As the individual must be just before he
    can be truly generous, so must human society be based upon justice before
    it can be based on benevolence. &#8212; Social Problems &#8212; Chapter 9,
    First Principles</p>
  <p>It is, something grander than Benevolence, something more august than Charity &#8212; it
    is Justice herself that demands of us to right this wrong. Justice that will
    not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice that with the scales
    carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies and prayers? Shall
    we avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches when hungry infants
    moan and weary mothers weep?<br>
      <br>
      Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that attributes
      to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and brutishness
      that come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the All-Father and
      lays on Him the responsibility for the want and crime of our great cities.
      We degrade the Everlasting. We slander the Just One. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
      X, Chapter 5, The Law of Human Progress: The Central Truth</p>
  <p>WE see that God in His dealings with men has not been a bungler or a niggard;
    that He has not brought too many men into the world; that He has not neglected
    abundantly to supply them; that He has not intended that bitter competition
    of the masses for a mere animal existence, and that monstrous aggregation
    of wealth which characterizes our civilization; but that these evils, which
    lead so many to say there is no God, or yet more impiously to say that they
    are of God's ordering, are due to our denial of His moral law. We see that
    the law of justice, the law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of
    perfection, but indeed the law of social life. We see that, if we were only
    to observe it, there would be work for all, leisure for all, abundance for
    all; and that civilization would tend to give to the poorest not only necessaries,
    but all comforts and reasonable luxuries as well. We see that Christ was
    not a mere dreamer when He told men that, if they would seek the kingdom
    of God and its right doing, they might no more worry about material things
    than do the lilies of the field about their raiment; but that He was only
    declaring what political economy, in the light of modern discovery, shows
    to be a sober truth. &#8212; The Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope

<p>Martin Luther King, Jr: <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">Where
    Do We Go From Here?</a> (1967)</p>
<p>Now our country can do this. John Kenneth Galbraith said that a guaranteed
  annual income could be done for about twenty billion dollars a year. And I
  say to you today, that if our nation can spend thirty-five billion dollars
  a year to fight an unjust, evil war in Vietnam, and twenty billion dollars
  to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to put God's children
  on their own two feet right here on earth. ...</p>
<p>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about &quot;Where
  do we go from here,&quot; that we honestly face the fact that the Movement
  must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American
  society. There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must ask
  the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And
  when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the economic
  system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that question,
  you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I'm simply saying that
  more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society.
  We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's market place.
  But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs
  restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. You see, my friends,
  when you deal with this,</p>
<p> * you begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the oil?&quot;<br>
  * You begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the iron ore?&quot;<br>
  * You begin to ask the question, &quot;Why is it that people have to pay water
  bills in a world that is two thirds water?&quot;</p>
<p>These are questions that must be asked. ...</p>
<p>So, I conclude by saying again today that we have a task and let us go out
  with a &quot;divine dissatisfaction.&quot;</p>
<p> * Let us be dissatisfied until America will no longer have a high blood pressure
  of creeds and an anemia of deeds.<br>
  * Let us be dissatisfied until the tragic walls that separate the outer city
  of wealth and comfort and the inner city of poverty and despair shall be crushed
  by the battering rams of the forces of justice.<br>
  * Let us be dissatisfied until those that live on the outskirts of hope are
  brought into the metropolis of daily security.<br>
  * Let us be dissatisfied until slums are cast into the junk heaps of history,
  and every family is living in a decent sanitary home.<br>
  * Let us be dissatisfied until the dark yesterdays of segregated schools will
  be transformed into bright tomorrows of quality, integrated education.<br>
  * Let us be dissatisfied until integration is not seen as a problem but as
  an opportunity to participate in the beauty of diversity.<br>
  * Let us be dissatisfied until men and women, however black they may be, will
  be judged on the basis of the content of their character and not on the basis
  of the color of their skin. Let us be dissatisfied.<br>
  * Let us be dissatisfied until every state capitol houses a governor who will
  do justice, who will love mercy and who will walk humbly with his God.<br>
  * Let us be dissatisfied until from every city hall, justice will roll down
  like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.<br>
  * Let us be dissatisfied until that day when the lion and the lamb shall lie
  down together, and every man will sit under his own vine and fig tree and none
  shall be afraid.<br>
  * Let us be dissatisfied. And men will recognize that out of one blood God

  reap.&quot; This is our hope for the future, and with this faith we will be
  able to sing in some not too distant tomorrow with a cosmic past tense, &quot;We
  have overcome, we have overcome, deep in my heart, I did believe we would overcome.&quot; ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">read

            <p>A poor man was facing eviction and couldn't cover his family's
              most basic needs. He prayed and asked God to let him win the lottery.
              And he waited. A week later, he prayed again, explaining how badly
              his family needed that lottery jackpot. And he waited. At the end
              of the second week, he again beseeched God to let him win the lottery.
              God suggested that it might help if he would buy a lottery ticket.</p>

        It had been raining for days and days, and a terrible flood had come
            over the land. The waters rose so high that one man was forced to
            climb onto the roof of his house.<br>
        <br>
        As the waters rose higher and higher, a man in a rowboat appeared, and
        told him to get in. "No," replied the man on the roof. "I have faith
        in the Lord; the Lord will save me." So the man in the rowboat went away.
        The man on the roof prayed for God to save him.<br>
        <br>
        The waters rose higher and higher, and suddenly a speedboat appeared. "Climb
        in!" shouted a man in the boat. "No," replied the man on the roof. "I
        have faith in the Lord; the Lord will save me." So the man in the speedboat
        went away. The man on the roof prayed for God to save him.<br>
        <br>
        The waters continued to rise. A helicopter appeared and over the loudspeaker,
        the pilot announced he would lower a rope to the man on the roof. "No," replied
        the man on the roof. "I have faith in the Lord; the Lord will save me." So
        the helicopter went away. The man on the roof prayed for God to save
        him.<br>
        <br>
        The waters rose higher and higher, and eventually they rose so high that
        the man on the roof was washed away, and alas, the poor man drowned.<br>
        <br>
        Upon arriving in heaven, the man marched straight over to God. "Heavenly
        Father," he said, "I had faith in you, I prayed to you to save me, and
        yet you did nothing. Why?" God gave him a puzzled look, and replied "I
        sent you two boats and a helicopter, what more did you expect?"</small></td>
