          Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give

            our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those
          who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us

              which is inherently common property &#8212; even if we hope ourselves
              to be net beneficiaries of that system at some point in our lives.
              Deliver us from the evil of
                    poverty
                    created by the privatization of that which

      <p>What is a <em>trespass</em>? Is privatization of the economic value
        of land &#8212; rent &#8212; a trespass against the rights of our fellow
        human beings? When <em>some</em> get to privatize what should really be passed
        along
        to the commons as the basis of our common spending, isn't there a major
        injustice taking place? <em>Should we forgive it, or seek to change it?</em></p>
      <p>Do we envision it as God's will that some of us should grow rich by
        collecting rent on what God provides, while others are forced to pay
        them for what God provides?</p>
      <p>Let us not forget that our forefathers prayed that prayer, even while

      <p>Henry George, in <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>, sought the cause of poverty in

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy Kingdom Come</a>
(1889 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have just joined in the most
solemn, the most sacred, the most
catholic of all prayers: &#8220;Our Father which art in Heaven!&#8221;
To all of us who have learned it in our infancy, it oft calls up the
sweetest and most tender emotions. Sometimes with feeling, sometimes
as a matter of course, how often have we repeated it? For centuries,
daily, hourly, has that prayer gone up.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We have become accustomed to
think that God&#8217;s kingdom, is
not intended for this world; that, virtually, this is the
devil&#8217;s world, and that God&#8217;s kingdom is in some other
sphere, to which He is to take good people when they die &#8212; as
good Americans are said when they die to go to Paris. If that be so,
what is the use of praying for the coming of the kingdom? Is God the
loving Father of whom Christ told &#8212; is He a God of that kind; a
God who looks on this world, sees its sufferings and its miseries,
sees high faculties aborted, lives stunted, innocence turned to vice
and crime, and heartstrings strained and broken, yet, having it in
His power, will not bring that kingdom of peace, and love, and plenty
and happiness? Is God indeed a self-willed despot, whom we must coax
to do the good He might? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of it. The Almighty &#8212; and I
say it with reverence
&#8212; the Almighty could not bring that kingdom of Himself. For,
what is the kingdom of God; the kingdom that Christ taught us to pray
for? Is it not in the doing of God&#8217;s will, not by automata, not
by animals who are compelled, but by intelligent beings clothed with
free will, intelligent beings knowing good from evil? <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; When Christ
taught that prayer He
did not mean that humans should idly phrase these words, but that for
the coming of that kingdom humanity must work as well as pray!<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Our Father!&#8221; &#8220;Our Father!&#8221;
Whose? Not <span style="font-style: italic;">my
</span>Father &#8212; that is not the prayer. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Our </span>Father&#8221; &#8212;
not the father of any sect, or any class, but the Father of all
humanity. The All- Father, the equal Father, the loving Father. He it
is we ask to bring the kingdom. Aye, we ask it with our lips! We call
Him &#8220;Our Father&#8221;, the All, the Universal Father, when we
kneel down to pray to Him. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that He is the All-Father &#8212;
that He is all
people&#8217;s Father &#8212; we deny by our institutions. The
All-Father who made the world, the All-Father who created us in His
image, and put us upon the earth to draw subsistence from its bosom;
to find in the earth all the materials that satisfy our wants,
waiting only to be worked up by our labour! If He is the All-Father,
then are not all human beings, all children of the Creator, equally
entitled to the use of His bounty? And, yet, our laws say that this
God&#8217;s earth is not here for the use of all His children, but
only for the use of a privileged few! 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There was a little dialogue
published in the United States, in
the west, some time ago. Possibly you may have seen it. It is between
a boy and his father when visiting a brickyard. The boy looks at the
men making bricks, and he asks who those dirty men are, why they are
making up the clay, and what they are doing it for. He learns, and
then he asks about the owner of the brickyard. &#8220;He does not make
any bricks; he gets his income from letting the other men make
bricks.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the boy wants to know how
the man who owns the brickyard
gets his title to the brickyard &#8212; whether he made it. &#8220;No,
he did not make it,&#8221; the father replies: &#8220;God made
it.&#8221; The boy asks, &#8220;Did God make it for him?&#8221; Whereat
his father tells him that he must not ask questions such as that, but
that anyhow it is all right, and it is all in accordance with
God&#8217;s law. The boy, who of course was a Sunday school boy, and
had been to church, goes off mumbling to himself &#8220;that God so
loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to die for all
men&#8221;; but that He so loved the owner of this brickyard that He
gave him the brickyard too.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This has a blasphemous sound. But
I do not refer to it lightly.
I do not like to speak lightly of sacred subjects. Yet it is well
sometimes that we should be fairly shocked into thinking. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of what Christianity
teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Better to me, higher to me, is
the atheist, who says there is no
God, than the professed Christian who, prating of the goodness and
the Fatherhood of God, tells us in words as some do, or tells us
indirectly as others do, that millions and millions of human
creatures &#8212; [at this point a child was heard crying]
&#8212; don&#8217;t take the little thing out &#8212; that millions and
millions of human beings, like that little baby, are being brought
into the world daily by the creative fiat, and no place in this world
provided for them. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Aye! Tells us that, by the laws
of God, the poor are created in
order that the rich may have the unctuous satisfaction of dealing out
charity to them, and attributes to the laws of God the state of
things which exists in this city of Glasgow, as in other great cities
on both sides of the Atlantic, where little children are dying every
day, dying by hundreds of thousands, because having come into this
world &#8212; those children of God, with His fiat, by His decree
&#8212; they find that there is not space on the earth sufficient for
them to live; and are driven out of God&#8217;s world because they
cannot get room enough, cannot get air enough, cannot get sustenance
enough. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I believe in no such god. If I
did, though I might bend before
him in fear, I would hate him in my heart. Not room for the little
children here! Look around any country in the civilised world; is
there not room enough and to spare? Not food enough? Look at the
unemployed labour, look at the idle acres, look through every country
and see natural opportunities going to waste. Aye! That Christianity
puts on the Creator the evil, the injustice, the degradation that are
due to humanity&#8217;s injustice is worse, far worse, than atheism.
That is the blasphemy, and if there be a sin against the Holy Ghost,
that is the unpardonable sin!
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider: &#8220;Give us this day
our daily bread.&#8221; I
stopped in a hotel last week &#8212; a hydropathic establishment. A
hundred or more guests sat down to table together. Before they ate
anything, a man stood up, and, thanking God, asked Him to make us all
grateful for His bounty. And it is so at every mealtime &#8212; such
an acknowledgement is made over well-filled boards. What do we mean
by it? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If Adam, when he got out of Eden,
had sat down and commenced to
pray, he might have prayed till this time without getting anything to
eat unless he went to work for it. Yet food is God&#8217;s bounty. He
does not bring meat and vegetables all prepared. What He gives are
the opportunities of producing these things &#8212; of bringing them
forth by labour. His mandate is &#8212; it is written in the Holy
Word, it is graven on every fact in nature &#8212; that by labour we
shall bring forth these things. Nature gives to labour and to nothing
else. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What God gives are the natural
elements that are indispensable
to labour. He gives them, not to one, not to some, not to one
generation, but to all. They are His gifts, His bounty to the whole
human race. And yet in all our civilised countries what do we see?
That a few people have appropriated these bounties, claiming them as
theirs alone, while the great majority have no legal right to apply
their labour to the reservoirs of Nature and draw from the
Creator&#8217;s bounty.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Thus it happens that all over the
civilised world that class
that is called peculiarly &#8216;the labouring class&#8217; is the poor
class, and that people who do no labour, who pride themselves on
never having done honest labour, and on being descended from fathers
and grandfathers who never did a stroke of honest labour in their
lives, revel in a superabundance of the things that labour brings
forth.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Mr Abner Thomas, of New York, a
strict orthodox Presbyterian &#8212; and the son of Rev Dr Thomas, author of a commentary on the
bible &#8212;wrote a little while ago an allegory. Dozing off in his
chair, he dreamt that he was ferried over the River of Death, and,
taking the straight and narrow way, came at last within sight of the
Golden City. A fine-looking old gentleman angel opened the wicket,
inquired his name, and let him in; warning him, at the same time,
that it would be better if he chose his company in heaven, and did
not associate with disreputable angels. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What!&#8221; said the newcomer, in
astonishment: &#8220;Is
not this heaven?&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;But
there are a lot of
tramp angels here now."<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come.&#8221; No one can
think of the kingdom
for which the prayer asks without feeling that it must be a kingdom
of justice and equality &#8212; not necessarily of equality in
condition, but of equality in opportunity. And no one can think of it
without seeing that a very kingdom of God might be brought on this
earth if people would but seek to do justice &#8212; if people would
but acknowledge the essential principle of Christianity, that of
doing to others as we would have others do to us, and of recognising
that we are all here equally the children of the one Father, equally
entitled to share His bounty, equally entitled to live our lives and
develop our faculties, and to apply our labour to the raw material
that He has provided. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Early Christianity did not mean,
in its prayer for the coming of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, a kingdom in heaven, but a kingdom on earth.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What was persecuted was a great
movement for social reform
&#8212; the gospel of justice &#8212; heard by common fishermen with
gladness, carried by labourers and slaves into the imperial city of
Rome. The Christian revelation was the doctrine of human equality, of
the fatherhood of God, of the brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity.
It struck at the very basis of that monstrous tyranny that then
oppressed the civilised world; it struck at the fetters of the
captive, and at the bonds of the slave, at that monstrous injustice
which allowed a class to revel on the proceeds of labour, while those
who did the labour fared scantily. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That is the reason why early
Christianity was persecuted. And
when they could no longer hold it down, then the privileged classes
adopted and perverted the new faith, and it became, in its very
triumph, not the pure Christianity of the early days, but a
Christianity that, to a very great extent, was the servitor of the
privileged classes.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> And, instead of preaching the
essential Fatherhood of God, the
essential brotherhood and sisterhood of humankind, its high priests
grafted onto the pure truths of the gospel the blasphemous doctrine
that the All-Father is a respecter of persons, and that by His will
and on His mandate is founded that monstrous injustice which condemns
the great mass of humanity to unrequited hard toil. There has been no
failure of Christianity. The failure has been in the sort of
Christianity that has been preached. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Nothing is clearer than that if
we are all children of the
universal Father, we are all entitled to the use of His bounty.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small> If the loving God does reign, if His laws are the laws not
merely of the physical, but of the moral universe, there must be a
way of carrying His will into effect, there must be a way of doing
equal justice to all of His creatures.</small><br>
<br>
<small> There is. The people who deny that there is any practical way
of
carrying into effect the perception that all human beings are equally
children of the Creator shut their eyes to the plain and obvious way.<strong>... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Yet, while in looking through the
laws of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical </span>nature, we
find intelligence we do not so clearly find beneficence. But in the
great <span style="font-style: italic;">social </span>fact that as
population increases, and improvements are
made, and men progress in civilisation, the one thing that rises
everywhere in value is land, and in this we may see a proof of the
beneficence of the Creator. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider what it means! It
means that the social laws are
adapted to progressive humanity! In a rude state of society where
there is no need for common expenditure, there is no value attaching
to land. The only value which attaches there is to things produced by
labour. But as civilisation goes on, as a division of labour takes
place, as people come into centres, so do the common wants increase,
and so does the necessity for public revenue arise. And so in that
value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the
individual does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a
provision intended &#8212; we may safely say intended &#8212; to meet
that social want. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Just as society grows, so do
the common needs grow, and so grows
this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided fund from which they
can be supplied.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; It may be
that we shall never see
it. But to those people who realise that it may come, to those who
realise that it is given to them to work for the coming of God&#8217;s
kingdom on earth, there is for them, though they never see that
kingdom here, an exceedingly great reward &#8212; the reward of
feeling that they, little and insignificant though they may be, are
doing something to help the coming of that kingdom, doing something
on the side of that Good Power that shows all through the universe,
doing something to tear this world from the devil&#8217;s grasp and
make it the kingdom of righteousness. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Aye, and though it should never
come, yet those who struggle for
it know in the depths of their hearts that it must exist somewhere
&#8212; they know that, somewhere, sometime, those who strive their
best for the coming of the kingdom will be welcomed into the kingdom,
and that to them, even to them, sometime, somewhere, the King shall
say: &#8220;Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into
the joy of thy Lord.&#8221;

dreamed; that day in which involuntary poverty shall be utterly
abolished; that day in which there shall be work for all, leisure for
all, abundance for all; that day in which even the humblest shall
have his share, not merely of the necessities and comforts, but of
the reasonable luxuries of life; that day in which every child born
among us may hope to develop all that is highest and noblest in its
nature; that day in which in the midst of abundance the fear of want
shall be gone. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This greed for wealth that leads
men to turn their backs upon
everything that is just and true, and to trample upon their fellows
lest they be trampled upon; to search and to strive, and to strain
every faculty of their natures to accumulate what they cannot take
away, will be gone, and in that day the higher qualities of man shall
have their opportunity and claim their reward. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We cannot change human nature; we
are not so foolish as to dream
that human nature can be changed. What we mean to do is to give the
good in human nature its opportunity to develop. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Try our remedy by any test &#8212; the
test of justice; the test of
expediency. Try it by any dictum of political economy; by any maxim
of good morals; by any maxim of good government. It will stand every
test. What I ask you to do is not to take what I or any other man may
say, but to think for yourselves!&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/WoL.htm">The Wages of
Labor<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In seeking to restore to all men
their equal and natural
rights we do not seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both
know by faith and see by fact that injustice can profit no one and that
justice must benefit all. Nor do we seek any futile and ridiculous
equality. We recognise that there must always be differences and
inequalities. In so far as these are in conformity with the moral law,
in so far as they do not violate the command, &#8220;Thou shalt not steal,&#8221;
we are content.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The equality we would bring about
is not the equality of
fortune, but the equality of natural opportunity; the equality that
reason and religion alike proclaim &#8211; the equality in usufruct of all
His children to the bounty of Our Father Who art in Heaven!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In doing this, we would not levy
the slightest tax on the
possessors of wealth, no matter how rich they might be.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only do we deem such taxes a
violation of the right of
property, but we see that it is impossible for any one to produce
wealth for himself without adding to the wealth of the world.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, consider the moral aspect of
the present condition of labor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is &#8220;the question of the
hour,&#8221; the question that is
filling minds with painful apprehension? Reduced to its lowest
expression it is the poverty of men willing to work. And what is the
lowest expression of this phrase? It is that they lack bread &#8211; for in
that one word we most concisely and strongly express all the manifold
material satisfactions needed by humanity, the absence of which
constitutes poverty.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, what is the prayer of
Christendom &#8211; the universal prayer;
the prayer that goes up daily and hourly wherever the name of Christ is
honoured; that ascends from the high altar of St. Peter&#8217;s at Rome, and
that is repeated by the youngest child that the poorest Christian
mother has taught to lisp a request to her Father in Heaven? It is: &#8220;<b><i>Give
us this day our daily bread!</i></b>&#8221; Yet, where this prayer goes up,
daily and hourly, men lack bread! Why?
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is the answer, the only true
answer! <span style="font-weight: bold;">If men lack
bread, it is not that God has not done His part in providing it. If men
willing to labor are cursed with poverty, it is not that the
storehouse has failed, that the supply He has promised for the daily
wants of His children is not here in abundance.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is, that, &#8220;impiously
violating the benevolent intentions
of their Creator,&#8221; men have made land private property, and thus have
given into the exclusive ownership of the few the provision that a
bountiful Father has made for all!...&nbsp;<a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For in this beautiful provision made by natural law for the social needs
    of civilization we see that God has intended civilization; that all our discoveries
    and inventions do not and cannot outrun his forethought, and that steam,
    electricity and labor-saving appliances only make the great moral laws clearer
    and more important. In the growth of this great fund, increasing with social
    advance &#8212; a fund that accrues from the growth of the community and
    belongs therefore to the community &#8212; we see not only that there is
    no need for the taxes that lessen wealth, that engender corruption, that
    promote inequality and teach men to deny the gospel; but that to take this
    fund for the purpose for which it was evidently intended would in the highest
    civilization secure to all the equal enjoyment of God&#8217;s bounty, the
    abundant opportunity to satisfy their wants, and would provide amply for
    every legitimate need of the state. We see that God in his dealings with
    men has not been a bungler or a niggard; that he has not brought too many
    men into the world; that he has not neglected abundantly to supply them;
    that he has not intended that bitter competition of the masses for a mere
    animal existence and that monstrous aggregation of wealth which characterize
    our civilization; but that these evils which lead so many to say there is
    no God, or yet more impiously to say that they are of God&#8217;s ordering,
    are due to our denial of his moral law. We see that the law of justice, the
    law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection, but indeed the
    law of social life. We see that if we were only to observe it there would
    be work for all, leisure for all, abundance for all; and that civilization
    would tend to give to the poorest not only necessities, but all comforts
    and reasonable luxuries as well. We see that Christ was not a mere dreamer
    when he told men that if they would <strong>seek the kingdom of God</strong> and
    its right-doing they might no more worry about material things than do the
    lilies of the
    field about their raiment; but that he was only declaring what political
    economy in the light of modern discovery shows to be a sober truth. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<p>    Henry George: <a href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html">The
    Single
    Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge It</a> (1890)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the Single Tax we may
expect these
<small><small><small><b>advantages</b></small></small>:</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. It would dispense with a
whole army of tax gatherers and other officials which present taxes
require, and place in the treasury a much larger portion of what is
taken from people, while by making government simpler and cheaper, it
would tend to make it purer. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It would
get rid of taxes which necessarily promote fraud, perjury, bribery, and
corruption, which lead men into temptation, and which tax what the
nation can least afford to spare--honesty and conscience.</span> Since
land lies out-of-doors and cannot be removed, and its value is the most
readily ascertained of all values, the tax to which we would resort can
be collected with the minimum of cost and the least strain on public
morals. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>...&nbsp; These are the fundamental reasons for which we urge
the Single
Tax, believing it to be the greatest and most fundamental of all
reforms. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We do not think it will
change human nature. That, man can
never do; but it will bring about conditions in which human nature
can develop what is best, instead of, as now in so many cases, what
is worst.</span> </small><ul>
  <li><small>It will permit such an enormous production as we can now
hardly conceive. </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It will secure an
equitable distribution. </span></small></li>
  <li><small>It will
solve the labor problem and dispel the darkening clouds which are now
gathering over the horizon of our civilization. </small></li>
  <li><small>It will make
undeserved poverty an unknown thing. </small></li>
  <li><small>It will check the
soul-destroying greed of gain. </small></li>
  <li><small>It will enable men to be at least as
honest, as true, as considerate, and as high-minded as they would
like to be. </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It will remove temptation
to lying, false, swearing,
bribery, and law breaking. </span></small></li>
  <li><small>It will open to all, even the poorest, the
comforts and refinements and opportunities of an advancing
civilization. </small></li>
</ul>
<small> </small><small>It will thus, so we reverently believe, clear
the way
for the coming of that kingdom of right and justice, and consequently
of abundance and peace and happiness, for which the Master told His
disciples to pray and work. It is not that it is a promising
invention or cunning device that we look for the Single Tax to do all
this; but it is because it involves a conforming of the most
important and fundamental adjustments of society to the supreme law
of justice, because it involves the basing of the most important of
our laws on the principle that we should do to others as we would be
done by.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The readers of this article, I may
fairly presume, believe, as I
believe, that there is a world for us beyond this. The limit of space
has prevented me from putting before them more than some hints for
thought. Let me in conclusion present two more:</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <p><small>1. What would be the result in
  heaven itself if those who get there first instituted private property
  in the surface of heaven, and parceled it out in absolute ownership
  among themselves, as we parcel out the surface of the earth? </small><br>
  <small>2. Since we cannot conceive of a heaven in which the
  equal
  rights of God's children to their Father's bounty is denied, as we now
  deny them on this earth, what is the duty enjoined on Christians by the
  daily prayer: "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth, as it is
  in heaven?" <a style="font-weight: bold;"
