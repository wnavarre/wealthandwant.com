<br>
Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/Ode_to_Liberty.html">Ode to
Liberty&nbsp;</a> (1877 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>WE HONOR LIBERTY in name and in
form. We set up her statues and sound her praises. But we have not
fully trusted her. And with our growth so grow her demands. She will
have no half service! Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex
the ear in empty boastings. For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is
the natural law &#8212; the law of health and symmetry and strength, of
fraternity and co-operation.</small><br>
<br>
<small> They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission
when she has abolished hereditary privileges and given men the
ballot, who think of her as having no further relations to the
everyday affairs of life, have not seen her real grandeur &#8212; to
them the poets who have sung of her must seem rhapsodists, and her
martyrs fools!&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small> We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth,
knowledge, invention, national strength and national independence as
other things. But, of all these, Liberty is the source, the mother,
the necessary condition. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Shall we not trust her? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> In our time, as in times before,
creep on the insidious forces
that, producing inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the
clouds begin to lower. Liberty calls to us again. We must follow her
further; we must trust her fully. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Either
we must wholly accept her or
she will not stay. It is not enough that men should vote; it is not
enough that they should be theoretically equal before the law. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">They
must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means
of life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty
of nature.</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>Either
this, or Liberty withdraws her light! Either this,
or darkness comes on, and the very forces that progress has evolved
turn to powers that work destruction. This is the universal law. This
is the lesson of the centuries. Unless its foundations be laid in
justice the social structure cannot stand. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our
primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In
allowing one man to own the land on which and from which other men
must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases
as material progress goes on.</span> This is the subtle alchemy that in
ways they do not realize is extracting from the masses in every
civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting
a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been
destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political
freedom, and must soon transmute democratic institutions into
anarchy. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a
curse. </span>It is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars
and
squalid tenement houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads
men with want and consumes them with greed; that robs women of the
grace and beauty of perfect womanhood; that takes from little
children the joy and innocence of life&#8217;s morning. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Civilization
so based cannot continue. The eternal laws of the
universe forbid it.&nbsp; ...</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But if, while there is yet time,
we turn to Justice and obey
her, if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now
threaten must disappear, the forces that now menace will turn to
agencies of elevation. Think of the powers now wasted; of the
infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored; of the possibilities
of which the wondrous inventions of this century give us but a hint.
With want destroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with the
fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the jealousy
and fear that now array men against each other; with mental power
loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure;
and who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar?
Words fail the thought! It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung
and high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious
vision which has always haunted man with gleams of fitful splendor.
It is what he saw whose eyes at Patmos were closed in a trance. It is
the culmination of Christianity &#8212; the City of God on earth, with
its walls of jasper and its gates of pearl! It is the reign of the
Prince of Peace!</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And Emma Lazarus' world famous
sonnet:, <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Colossus</span>:</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Not like the brazen giant of
Greek fame <br>
With conquering limbs astride from land to land; <br>
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand <br>
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame <br>
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name <br>
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand <br>
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command <br>
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. <br>
"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she <br>
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor, <br>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, <br>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. <br>
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, <br>
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <a
