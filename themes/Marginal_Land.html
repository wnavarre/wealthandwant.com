          is willing to give labor or the results of labor for the privilege
          of using it; and what anyone will thus give, depends not upon the capacity

      <p>Thomas Flavin, writing in <a href="http://www.knowledgerush.com/pg/etext96/bti1010.txt">The
    Iconoclast, 1897</a> </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Now, it is quite true that all taxes of whatever nature are paid out of
          the products of labor. But must they be for that reason a tax on labor products.
          Let us see. </p>
        <p>I suppose you won't deny that a unit of labor applies to different kinds
          of land will give very different results. Suppose that a unit of labor produces
          on A's land 4, on B's 3, on C's 2 and on D's 1. A's land is the most, and
          D's is the least, productive land in use in the community to which they belong.
          B's and C's represent intermediate grades. Suppose each occupies the best
          land that was open to him when he entered into possession. Now, B, and C,
          and D have just as good a right to the use of the best land as A had. </p>
        <p>Manifestly then, if this be the whole story, there cannot be equality of
          opportunity where a unit of labor produces such different results, all other
          things being equal except the land. </p>
        <p>How is this equality to be secured? There is but one possible way. Each
          must surrender for the common use of all, himself included, whatever advantages
          accrues to him from the possession of land superior to that which falls to
          the lot of him who occupies the poorest. </p>
        <p>In the case stated, what the unit of labor produces for D, is what it should
          produce for A, B and C, if these are not to have an advantage of natural
          opportunity over D. </p>
        <p>Hence equity is secured when A pays 3, B, 2 and C, 1 into a common fund
          for the common use of all &#8212; to be expended, say in digging a well,
          making a road or bridge, building a school, or other public utility. </p>
        <p>Is it not manifest that here the tax which A, B and C pay into a common
          fund, and from which D is exempt, is not a tax on their labor products (though
          paid out of them) but a tax on the superior advantage which they enjoy over
          D, and to which D has just as good a right as any of them. </p>
        <p>The result of this arrangement is that each takes up as much of the best
          land open to him as he can put to gainful use, and what he cannot so use
          he leaves open for the next. Moreover, he is at no disadvantage with the
          rest who have come in ahead of him, for they provide for him, in proportion
          to their respective advantages, those public utilities which invariably arise
          wherever men live in communities. Of course he will in turn hold to those
          who come later the same relation that those who came earlier held to him. </p>
        <p>Suppose now that taxes had been levied on labor products instead of land;
          all that any land-holder would have to do to avoid the tax is to produce
          little or nothing. He could just squat on his land, neither using it himself
          nor letting others use it, but he would not stop at this, for he would grab
          to the last acre all that he could possibly get hold of. Each of the others
          would do the same in turn, with the sure result that by and by, E, F and
          G would find no land left for them on which they might make a living. </p>
        <p>So they would have to hire their labor to those who had already monopolized
          the land, or else buy or rent a piece of land from them. Behold now the devil
          of landlordism getting his hoof on God's handiwork! Exit justice, freedom,
          social peace and plenty. Enter robbery, slavery, social discontent, consuming
          grief, riotous but unearned wealth, degrading pauperism, crime breeding,
          want, the beggar's whine, and the tyrant's iron heel. </p>
        <p><strong>And how did it all come about? By the simple expedient of taxing labor products
          in order that precious landlordism might laugh and grow fat on the bovine
          stupidity of the community that contributes its own land values toward its
          own enslavement! </strong></p>
        <p>And yet men vacuously ask, &quot;What difference does it make?&quot; </p>
        <p>O tempora! O mores! To be as plain as is necessary, it makes this four-fold
          difference. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>First, it robs the community of its land values; </li>
          <li>second, it robs labor of its wages in the name of taxation; </li>
          <li>third, it sustains and fosters landlordism, a most conspicuously damnable
            difference; </li>
          <li>fourth, it exhibits willing workers in enforced idleness; beholding their
            families in want on the one hand, and unused land that would yield them
            abundance on the other. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This last is a difference that cries to heaven for vengeance, and if it
          does not always cry in vain, will W. C. Brann be able to draw his robe close
          around him and with a good conscience exclaim, &quot;It's none of my fault;
          I am not my brother's keeper.&quot;</p>

        <p><small>Thus, to define Distributive
                Socialism we need to define "<b><i>surpluses</i></b>." These are primarily

                labor
                and
                capital are mobile and their supply is elastic; only land is fixed.
                Land rent is the basic taxable surplus. Where there is no land rent,
                an attempt to levy any tax can only abort production and land use,

  <p>George also brought out a countervailing point the critics have overlooked,
          in their exclusive concern with protecting high central rents from
    invasion. Taxes on the use and improvement of
  marginal land sterilize said land, "and tend to drive population and wealth from
  them to the great cities." That is not the last word on the subject either,
  but shows there is more to the subject than Cannan began to disclose. As George
  maintained,
  aborting rent on marginal land, not just rent-sharing on superior land, distorts
  locational
  decisions. ... <small><a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p> Fred Foldvary:&nbsp; <a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Picture an unpopulated island
where we're going to produce one
good, corn, and there are eleven grades of land. On the best land, we
can grow ten bushels of corn per week; the second land grows nine
bushels, and so on to the worst land that grows zero bushels. We'll
ignore capital goods at first. The first settlers go the best land.
While there is free ten-bushel land, rent is zero, so wages are 10.
When the 10-bushel land is all settled, immigrants go to the 9-bushel
land. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Wages in the 9-bushel land equal
9 while free land is available.
What then are wages in the 10-bushel land? They must also be 9, since
labor is mobile. If you offer less, nobody will come, and if you
offer a bit more than 9, everybody in the 9-bushel land will want to
work for you. Competition among workers makes wages the same all over
(we assume all workers are alike). So that extra bushel in the
10-bushel land, after paying 9 for labor, is rent. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That border line where the best
free land is being settled is
called the "margin of production." When the margin moves to the
8-bushel land, wages drop to 8. Rent is now 1 on the 9-bushel land and
2 on the 10-bushel land. Do you see what the trend is? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">As the margin
moves to less productive lands, wages are going down and rent is
going up. We can also now see that wages are determined at the margin
of production. That is the "law of wages."</span> The wage at the
margin
sets the wage for all lands. The production in the better lands left
after paying wages goes to rent. That is the "law of rent." If you
understand the law of wages and the law of rent, you see the cat! To
complete our cat story, suppose folks can get land to rent and sell
for higher prices later rather than using it now. This land
speculation will hog up lands and make the margin move further out
than without speculation, lowering wages and raising rent even more.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now we have good news and bad
news. The good news is that when we
put in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">capital goods</span>...</small>
we first left out from the example above,
the tools and technology increase the productivity of all the lands.
If production doubles, rent doubles, and wages go up. Wages won't
double, because workers have to pay for the tools, but even if wages
go up 50 percent, that's good news, and why industrialized economies
have a high standard of living. Also, high skills enable educated
workers to have a wage premium above the basic wage level. The bad
news is that the technology enables us to extend the margin to less
productive land, which lowers wages again. So there is this constant
race between technology raising wages and lower margins reducing
wages.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span> <small><a

Ethical Land Tenure</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I want to tell you the story of
Charles Avilla. A while back I came
across a book called <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ownership, Early
Christian Teachings</span>. Avilla was a divinity student in the
Phillipines. One of his professors had a great concern about poverty
conditions in the Phillipines, and was taking students out to prisons
where the cooks were the land rights revolutionaries in the
Phillipines. Because they kept pushing for land reform for the people,
they had ended up in jail. So they were political prisoners who were
reading the Bible and were asking the question, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">who did God give this earth to? Who does it
belong to?</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It isn't
in the Bible that so few should have so much and so many have so little.</span>
In the theological world in this upscale seminary he was trying to put
this together about poverty and what the biblical teachings were. He
had a thesis to write and he was thinking he would do something about
economic justice. One of his professors thought there would be a wealth
of information from the church's early history, the first 300 years
after Jesus. So he actually went back to read the Latin and Greek about
land ownership and found a wealth of information about the prophetic
railings of the people in that early time on the rights of the land. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the Judaic tradition, and the Talmudic tradition, how much of
the
Jubilee justice was actually implemented is a subject of discussion.
Some say it was a good idea but not put in place. Others say it was
substantially put into place.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The Talmudic rabinical discussion is of interest to Georgists
because
they tried to allocate the land according to the richness of the soil
for agriculture. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For better soil,
richer for agriculture, maybe an acre
of that would be allocated. On the poorer soil, these tribes could get
five acres.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The other thing was some lands
were closer to the market. Some land was
closer to Jerusalem. That is an advantage over those who would have to
travel a longer distance to get to the market.</span> How do you have
an equal
rights distribution of land allocation with reference to the market
problem? For those more advantageously situated, the adjustment was to
be made by money. Those holding land nearer the city should pay in to
the common treasury the estimated excess of value attaining to it by
reason of superior situation. While those holding land of less value by
reason of distance from the city would receive from the treasury a
money compensation. On the more valuable holdings would be imposed a
tax or a lease fee, the measure of which was the excess of their
respective values over a given standard, and the fund thus created was
to be paid out in due proportion to those whose holdings were in less
favorable locations.</small><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>
In this, then, we see affirmed the doctrine that natural advantages are
common property and may not be diverted to private gain. Throughout the
ages when wisdom is applied to land problems, we see this emerge</small>.</span>...<big><span

<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The major dynamic behind such
over-exploitation of parts of the environment is the process by which
hundreds of millions of people are displaced onto marginal land by
current tax-and-tenure systems. </span>In desperation they overwork
resources that ought to be carefully nurtured. Yet the practices of
such desperate peasants can be largely halted when the principles of
LVT are implemented and made clear. Daly makes the case that taking
away by taxation the value added by individuals from applying their own
labor and capital creates resentment but "taxing away value that no one
added, scarcity rents on nature's contribution, does not create
resentment. In fact, failing to tax away the scarcity rents to nature
and letting them accrue as unearned income to favored individuals has

a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a

Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land's
value goes up when population
increases and technological and economic development make labor more
productive. Those who "own" land often withhold it from use, expecting
to capture its increased value in the future -- thus, the possession of
land enables people to take an income that they did nothing to produce.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Speculative withholding of land
has disastrous consequences. Peasants who seek land on which to survive
are pushed out to poorer and poorer lands.</span> These "sub-marginal"
lands become their alternative place for self-employment. With such a
poor alternative, they have no choice but to accept very low wages.
Rent -- the payment to landowners -- absorbs more of the wealth
produced on all sites.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Land speculation also prevents development near the center of
cities,
pushing it to the outskirts while the center decays from neglect and
slums increase. The "<span style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl</span>"
engulfs farms and forests, even as it raises the price of land, making
use and development more costly.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Rapid destruction of the Amazon rain forest in Brazil dramatizes
how
the unnatural phenomenon of sprawl has an ominous worldwide impact on
the environment. In Brazil, ten per cent of the landowners own 80
percent of the land, while one million peasants are forced off the land
each year. And a mere one per cent controls 48 percent of the
cultivable land. The only place in Brazil where there is land for the
taking is in the Amazon rain forest. The destruction of the rain forest
is caused by a system that perpetuates artificial land shortages.
Nearly four-fifths of Brazil's arable land is covered by sprawling
latifundios, most of which are held by speculators who produce nothing.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here is the root cause of
poverty.
When laborers are faced with the choice of either bare subsistence
wages or land that can barely maintain life, labor itself is
marginalized and cannot effectively bargain on its own behalf. Wages,
generally, on all land, are driven down toward the point of bare
subsistence. Returns to capital are also depressed for the same reason,
deterring investment. When this is carried to an extreme -- when people
can no longer afford the goods being produced and when there is little
profit in applying capital -- the economy collapses. The inflated land
market, on which the speculative frenzy has fed, collapses too. </span><a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both Soilsmen and habitatspersons
have a point, we will see, but
they have a fatal weakness. Neither has a system that composes
conflict with other worthy goals, including each others'. As to
cities, both soilsmen and habitat-savers would direct cities away
from low-cost, high-productivity land to the high-cost leftover
lands. They would not make this an end in itself, of course, but it
is the necessary by-product of downgrading urban usage in the
competition for land.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, to
restore citriculture and habitat
in what is now L.A. we
would move the city folks to hazard-prone floodplains, steep slopes
subject to fire and erosion, quake-prone fault lines and liquefiable
soils, etc. We would also move them away from the center, imposing
longer commutes, greater auto-dependency, longer utility lines,
longer hauls to dispose of solid wastes, more air to protect, more
aquifer surface to protect, more land to protect from flooding,
etc.&nbsp; ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_EiSoE.html"><span

Employment, Growth And Progress On A Small Planet: Relieving Poverty
While Healing The Earth</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Weight of
excess burden of most taxes.</b> Many modern Georgists tend, oddly,
to trivialize the power of tax bias to keep land from its best use.
They have seized upon a conventional micro-economic device, now
generally called the &#8220;Harberger Triangle,&#8221; in recognition
of one Chicago-School expositor. It is based on supply and demand
curves, with no reference to land markets at all. Perhaps these
Georgists are hoping this will help them get through to ordinary
economists; but this device has the effect, by accident or design, of
minimizing estimates of the economic losses, or &#8220;excess
burdens,&#8221; that bad taxes cause. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The power of
tax bias to keep land from its best use is starkly
obvious by analyzing the economics of using marginal land.</span> Any
tax at
all will sterilize such land completely, unless the taxes are so
universal that the mobile factors, labor and capital, cannot escape
them by moving. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&#8220;Who cares about marginal land?&#8221;,
some may say. The
distorting power of taxes has been demonstrated inadvertently by
Chicago-School economists Gale Johnson and Stephen Cheung. They have
shown that <span style="font-weight: bold;">sharecropping</span>, as a
private arrangement, creates a bias on
the part of tenants to substitute land for labor and equipment,
almost without limit. This is because extra land costs the cropper
nothing, unless it adds to output, so the cropper&#8217;s interest is
to substitute land, which is free to him, for his labor and capital,
which he pays for. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxes
based on gross output affect
all landowners the same way the
cropshare lease affects croppers.</span> They make every landowner a
cropper
of the state, giving every landowner a motive to substitute land for
labor and capital indefinitely. Private landlords overcome this by
limiting how much land to allow each cropper; but the state has no
such offsetting control. Thus, each landowner&#8217;s motive to
acquire excess land runs wild. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In conjunction, consider that
taxes (other than property taxes)
are based solely on cash flows, thus entirely exempting all the
imputed income from and imputed consumption of the service flows of
land &#8211; the &#8220;amenities.&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Government
tells the landed
gentry, &#8220;Hold land as a totem, an heirloom, a private hunting
and riding park, a dream of future retirement, a speculation, a hedge
against inflation, an entry into high society, a beach access, a
protection against future neighbors, a shooting range, a golf course,
a ski hideaway, a drinking club, a private landing strip &#8230;
anything private and narcissistic or exclusionary or snobbish &#8230;
and your pleasures are tax exempt. Produce goods and services for
others, though, and we will treat you like a sharecropper &#8211; and
tax your employees, too.&#8221;</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now hark back to George&#8217;s second
force holding labor off the
better lands (Item A,3,b): <span style="font-weight: bold;">holding
land as a totem</span>. He noted that
tendency in an age before we even had an income tax, or state sales
taxes. Our present tax system magnifies the tendency beyond all
reason, resulting in the relegation of much of our best land to the
indulgences of the landed gentry, old and new.... <a

<small>To reprise from the section on forestry, we must
synthesize two concepts of land stewardship.&nbsp; Concept A says "save
for the future"; Concept B says put land to full use right now, to
serve and employ people.&nbsp; Concept AB says do both, but each in the
right place.&nbsp; Use the good land, use it well and fully, employ the
workers, serve everyone's needs.&nbsp; Congregate and cooperate on
central, low, flat, fertile ground, as efficient markets and efficient
public policies would dictate anyway.&nbsp; Leave the marginal land in
peace.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>
