<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>... Nature
gives to labour, and to labour alone; there must be human work before
any article of wealth can be produced; and in the natural state of
things the man who toiled honestly and well would be the rich man,
and he who did not work would be poor. We have so reversed the order
of nature that we are accustomed to think of the workingman as a poor
man. </b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> And if you trace it out I believe
you will see that the primary
cause of this is that we compel those who work to pay others for
permission to do so. You may buy a coat, a horse, a house; there you
are paying the seller for labour exerted, for something that he has
produced, or that he has got from the man who did produce it; but
when you pay a man for land, what are you paying him for? You are
paying for something that no man has produced; you pay him for
something that was here before man was, or for a value that was
created, not by him individually, but by the community of which you
are a part. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What is the reason that
the land here, where we stand
tonight, is worth more than it was twenty-five years ago? What is the
reason that land in the centre of New York, that once could be bought
by the mile for a jug of whiskey, is now worth so much that, though
you were to cover it with gold, you would not have its value? Is it
not because of the increase of population?</span> Take away that
population,
and where would the value of the land be? Look at it in any way you
please.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now, supposing we should abolish
all other taxes direct and
indirect, substituting for them a tax upon land values, what would be
the effect? 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In the first place it would be to kill speculative
values. It would be to remove from the newer parts of the country the
bulk of the taxation and put it on the richer parts. It would be to
exempt the pioneer from taxation and make the larger cities pay more
of it. It would be to relieve energy and enterprise, capital and
labour, from all those burdens that now bear upon them. What a start
that would give to production! <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In the second place we could, from the
value of the land, not merely pay all the present expenses of the
government, but we could do infinitely more.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> In the city of San
Francisco James Lick left a few blocks of ground to be used for
public purposes there, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and
the rent amounts to so much, that out of
it will be built the largest telescope in the world, large public
baths and other public buildings, and various costly works. </span>If,

the city is built had accrued to San Francisco what could she not do? </span>...

<blockquote>
  <p>Here, let us imagine, is <b>an unbounded savannah</b>, stretching off in
    unbroken sameness of grass and flower, tree and rill, till the traveler tires
    of the monotony. Along comes the wagon of the first immigrant. Where to settle
    he cannot tell &#8212; every acre seems as good as every other acre. As to
    wood, as to water, as to fertility, as to situation, there is absolutely
    no choice, and he is perplexed by the embarrassment of richness. Tired out
    with the search for one place that is better than another, he stops &#8212; somewhere,
    anywhere &#8212; and starts to make himself a home. The soil is virgin and
    rich, game is abundant, the streams flash with the finest trout. Nature is
    at her very best. He has what, were he in a populous district, would make
    him rich; but he is very poor. To say nothing of the mental craving, which
    would lead him to welcome the sorriest stranger, he labors under all the
    material disadvantages of solitude. He can get no temporary assistance for
    any work that requires a greater union of strength than that afforded by
    his own family, or by such help as he can permanently keep. Though he has
    cattle, he cannot often have fresh meat, for to get a beefsteak he must kill
    a bullock. He must be his own blacksmith, wagonmaker, carpenter, and cobbler &#8212; in
    short, a "jack of all trades and master of none." He cannot have his children
    schooled, for, to do so, he must himself pay and maintain a teacher. Such
    things as he cannot produce himself, he must buy in quantities and keep on
    hand, or else go without, for he cannot be constantly leaving his work and
    making a long journey to the verge of civilization; and when forced to do
    so, the getting of a vial of medicine or the replacement of a broken auger
    may cost him the labor of himself and horses for days. Under such circumstances,
    though nature is prolific, the man is poor. It is an easy matter for him
    to get enough to eat; but beyond this, his labor will suffice to satisfy
    only the simplest wants in the rudest way. </p>
  <p>Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section* of the
    boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he is not beset
    by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the land is the same,
    there is one place that is clearly better for him than any other place, and
    that is where there is already a settler and he may have a neighbor. He settles
    by the side of the first comer, whose condition is at once greatly improved,
    and to whom many things are now possible that were before impossible, for
    two men may help each other to do things that one man could never do.<font size="-1"></font></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">*The public prairie lands of
      the United States were surveyed into sections of one mile square, and a
      quarter section (160 acres) was the usual government allotment to a settler
      under the Homestead Act. </font> <br>
  </div>
  Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction, settles where
  there are already two. Another, and another, until around our first comer there
  are a score of neighbors. Labor has now an effectiveness which, in the solitary
  state, it could not approach. If heavy work is to be done, the settlers have
  a logrolling, and together accomplish in a day what singly would require years.
  When one kills a bullock, the others take part of it, returning when they kill,
  and thus they have fresh meat all the time. Together they hire a schoolmaster,
  and the children of each are taught for a fractional part of what similar teaching
  would have cost the first settler. It becomes a comparatively easy matter to
  send to the nearest town, for some one is always going. But there is less need
  for such journeys. A blacksmith and a wheelwright soon set up shops, and our
  settler can have his tools repaired for a small part of the labor it formerly
  cost him. A store is opened and he can get what he wants as he wants it; a
  postoffice, soon added, gives him regular communication with the rest of the
  world. Then come a cobbler, a carpenter, a harness maker, a doctor; and a little
  church soon arises. Satisfactions become possible that in the solitary state
  were impossible. There are gratifications for the social and the intellectual
  nature &#8212; for that part of the man that rises above the animal. The power
  of sympathy, the sense of companionship, the emulation of comparison and contrast,
  open a wider, and fuller, and more varied life. In rejoicing, there are others
  to rejoice; in sorrow, the mourners do not mourn alone. There are husking bees,
  and apple parings, and quilting parties. Though the ballroom be unplastered
  and the orchestra but a fiddle, the notes of the magician are yet in the strain,
  and Cupid dances with the dancers. At the wedding, there are others to admire
  and enjoy; in the house of death, there are watchers; by the open grave, stands
  human sympathy to sustain the mourners. Occasionally, comes a straggling lecturer
  to open up glimpses of the world of science, of literature, or of art; in election
  times, come stump speakers, and the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and
  power, as the cause of empires is tried before him in the struggle of John
  Doe and Richard Roe for his support and vote. And, by and by, comes the circus,
  talked of months before, and opening to children whose horizon has been the
  prairie, all the realms of the imagination &#8212; princes and princesses of
  fairy tale, mailclad crusaders and turbaned Moors, Cinderella's fairy coach,
  and the giants of nursery lore; lions such as crouched before Daniel, or in
  circling Roman amphitheater tore the saints of God; ostriches who recall the
  sandy deserts; camels such as stood around when the wicked brethren raised
  Joseph from the well and sold him into bondage; elephants such as crossed the
  Alps with Hannibal, or felt the sword of the Maccabees; and glorious music
  that thrills and builds in the chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome
  of Kubla Khan.
    <p>Go to our settler now, and say to him: "You have so many fruit trees which
      you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a house &#8212; in short,
      you have by your labor added so much value to this farm. Your land itself
      is not quite so good. You have been cropping it, and by and by it will
      need manure. I will give you the full value of all your improvements if
      you will give it to me, and go again with your family beyond the verge
      of settlement." He would laugh at you. His land yields no more wheat or
      potatoes than before, but it does yield far more of all the necessaries
      and comforts of life. His labor upon it will bring no heavier crops, and,
      we will suppose, no more valuable crops, but it will bring far more of
      all the other things for which men work. The presence of other settlers &#8212; the
      increase of population &#8212; has added to the productiveness, in these
      things, of labor bestowed upon it, and this added productiveness gives
      it a superiority over land of equal natural quality where there are as
      yet no settlers. If no land remains to be taken up, except such as is as
      far removed from population as was our settler's land when he first went
      upon it, the value or rent of this land will be measured by the whole of
      this added capability. If, however, as we have supposed, there is a continuous
      stretch of equal land, over which population is now spreading, it will
      not be necessary for the new settler to go into the wilderness, as did
      the first. He will settle just beyond the other settlers, and will get
      the advantage of proximity to them. The value or rent of our settler's
      land will thus depend on the advantage which it has, from being at the
      center of population, over that on the verge. In the one case, the margin
      of production will remain as before; in the other, the margin of production
      will be raised.</p>
    <p>Population still continues to increase, and as it increases so do the
      economies which its increase permits, and which in effect add to the productiveness
      of the land. Our first settler's land, being the center of population,
      the store, the blacksmith's forge, the wheelwright's shop, are set up on
      it, or on its margin, where soon arises a village, which rapidly grows
      into a town, the center of exchanges for the people of the whole district.
      With no greater agricultural productiveness than it had at first, this
      land now begins to develop a productiveness of a higher kind. To labor
      expended in raising corn, or wheat, or potatoes, it will yield no more
      of those things than at first; but to labor expended in the subdivided
      branches of production which require proximity to other producers, and,
      especially, to labor expended in that final part of production, which consists
      in distribution, it will yield much larger returns. The wheatgrower may
      go further on, and find land on which his labor will produce as much wheat,
      and nearly as much wealth; but the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper,
      the professional man, find that their labor expended here, at the center
      of exchanges, will yield them much more than if expended even at a little
      distance away from it; and this excess of productiveness for such purposes
      the landowner can claim just as he could an excess in its wheat-producing
      power. And so our settler is able to sell in building lots a few of his
      acres for prices which it would not bring for wheatgrowing if its fertility
      had been multiplied many times. With the proceeds, he builds himself a
      fine house, and furnishes it handsomely. That is to say, to reduce the
      transaction to its lowest terms, the people who wish to use the land build
      and furnish the house for him, on condition that he will let them avail
      themselves of the superior productiveness which the increase of population
      has given the land.</p>
    <p>Population still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater utility
      to the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town has grown
      into a city &#8212; a St. Louis, a Chicago or a San Francisco &#8212; and
      still it grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with
      the best machinery and the most favorable facilities; the division of labor
      becomes extremely minute, wonderfully multiplying efficiency; exchanges
      are of such volume and rapidity that they are made with the minimum of
      friction and loss. Here is the heart, the brain, of the vast social organism
      that has grown up from the germ of the first settlement; here has developed
      one of the great ganglia of the human world. Hither run all roads, hither
      set all currents, through all the vast regions round about. Here, if you
      have anything to sell, is the market; here, if you have anything to buy,
      is the largest and the choicest stock. Here intellectual activity is gathered
      into a focus, and here springs that stimulus which is born of the collision
      of mind with mind. Here are the great libraries, the storehouses and granaries
      of knowledge, the learned professors, the famous specialists. Here are
      museums and art galleries, collections of philosophical apparatus, and
      all things rare, and valuable, and best of their kind. Here come great
      actors, and orators, and singers, from all over the world. Here, in short,
      is a center of human life, in all its varied manifestations.</p>
    <p>So enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the application
      of labor, that instead of one man &#8212; with a span of horses scratching
      over acres, you may count in places thousands of workers to the acre, working
      tier on tier, on floors raised one above the other, five, six, seven and
      eight stories from the ground, while underneath the surface of the earth
      engines are throbbing with pulsations that exert the force of thousands
      of horses. </p>
    <p><b>All these advantages attach to the land; it is on this land and no
        other that they can be utilized, for here is the center of population &#8212; the
        focus of exchanges, the market place and workshop of the highest forms
        of industry.</b> The productive powers which density of population has
        attached to this land are equivalent to the multiplication of its original
        fertility by the hundredfold and the thousandfold. And rent, which measures
        the difference between this added productiveness and that of the least
        productive land in use, has increased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever
        has succeeded to his right to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another
        Rip Van Winkle, he may have lain down and slept; still he is rich &#8212; not
        from anything he has done, but from the increase of population. There
        are lots from which for every foot of frontage the owner may draw more
        than an average mechanic can earn; there are lots that will sell for
        more than would suffice to pave them with gold coin. In the principal
        streets are towering buildings, of granite, marble, iron, and plate glass,
        finished in the most expensive style, replete with every convenience.
        Yet they are not worth as much as the land upon which they rest &#8212; the
        same land, in nothing changed, which when our first settler came upon
        it had no value at all.</p>
    <p>That this is the way in which the increase of population powerfully acts
      in increasing rent, whoever, in a progressive country, will look around
      him, may see for himself. The process is going on under his eyes. The increasing
      difference in the productiveness of the land in use, which causes an increasing
      rise in rent, results not so much from the necessities of increased population
      compelling the resort to inferior land, as from the increased productiveness
      which increased population gives to the lands already in use. <b>The most
      valuable lands on the globe, the lands which yield the highest rent, are
      not lands of surpassing natural fertility, but lands to which a surpassing
      utility has been given by the increase of population.</b></p>
    <p>The increase of productiveness or utility which increase of population
      gives to certain lands, in the way to which I have been calling attention,
      attaches, as it were, to the mere quality of extension. The valuable quality
      of land that has become a center of population is its superficial capacity &#8212; it
      makes no difference whether it is fertile, alluvial soil like that of Philadelphia,
      rich bottom land like that of New Orleans; a filled-in marsh like that
      of St. Petersburg, or a sandy waste like the greater part of San Francisco.</p>
    <p><b>And where value seems to arise from superior natural qualities, such
        as deep water and good anchorage, rich deposits of coal and iron, or
        heavy timber, observation also shows that these superior qualities are
        brought out, rendered tangible, by population. </b>The coal and iron
        fields of Pennsylvania, that today [1879] are worth enormous sums, were
        fifty years ago valueless. What is the efficient cause of the difference?
        Simply the difference in population. The coal and iron beds of Wyoming
        and Montana, which today are valueless, will, in fifty years from now,
        be worth millions on millions, simply because, in the meantime, population
        will have greatly increased.</p>
    <p>It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If
      the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch
      and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. <b><i>And
      very great command over the services of others comes to those who as the
      hatches are opened are permitted to say, "This is mine!" ... <em><a href="../HG/PP/SP/03_Rent_Grows.htm">read

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  <p>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</p>
  <p>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
    of what some have to sell and others must buy.</p>
  <p>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
    it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</p>
  <p>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
    sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
    and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to
    do.</p>
  <p>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
    thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest
    division of wealth.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
    of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
    octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
    duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
    on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
    the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
    be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
    need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
    deem a right one?</p>
  <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
    the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
    scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
    price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
    they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
    thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
    others.</p>
  <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
    of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
  <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
    are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
    that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
    the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
    effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
    buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
    gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
    of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
    sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
    it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
    of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
    instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
    of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
  <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
    show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
    intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
  <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
    a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
    the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
    of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
    in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
    of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
    reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
    always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
    user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
    pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
    the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
    or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
    to be a user.</p>
  <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
    of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
    what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
    to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
    community as a whole.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
        are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
        what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
        from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
        for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
        be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
        in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
        will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
        as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
        determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
        the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
        increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
        cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
        or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
        in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
        recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
        cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
        Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
          by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
          and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
          can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
      2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
      particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
      by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
      for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
      3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
      in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
      social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
      withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
        be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
        the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
        land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
        because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
        economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
        were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
        since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
        of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
        receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
        demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
        to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
        were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
        for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
        merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
    of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
    to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
    impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
    it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
    by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
    artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
    that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
    most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
    enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
    temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
    innocent.</p>
  <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
    needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
    of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
    nourishment of the babe.</p>
  <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
    the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
    but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
    But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
    necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
    begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
    more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
    time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
    The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
    since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
    steadily to reduce their cost. <strong>But the value of land on which population
    centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
    Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
    of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
    due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
    cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
    streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
    health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
    of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
    the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
    improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
    law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
    anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
    values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</strong></p>
  <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
    and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
    If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
    with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
    the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
    us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
    that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
  <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one thing
    that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue of which
    all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general improvements
    of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the
    dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
    Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
    is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it
    not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
    while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with the
    advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each member
    of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from
    his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen
    relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
    the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
    the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
    should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater
    equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
    an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The taxes we would abolish fall
most heavily on the poorer agricultural districts, and tend to drive
population and wealth from them to the great cities. The tax we would <span
 style="font-style: italic;">increase </span>would destroy that
monopoly of land which is the great cause of that distribution of
population which is crowding the people too closely together in some
places and scattering them too far apart in other places. Families live
on top of one another in cities because of the enormous speculative
prices at which vacant lots are held.<span style="font-weight: bold;">
In the country they are scattered too far apart for social intercourse
and convenience</span>, because, instead of each taking what land he
can use, every one who can grabs all he can get, in the hope of
profiting by its increase in value, and the next man must pass farther
on. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus we have scores of families
living under a single roof, and other families living in dugouts on the
prairies afar from neighbors -- some living too close to each other for
moral, mental, or physical health, and others too far separated for the
stimulating and refining influences of society. The wastes in health,
in mental vigor, and in unnecessary transportation result in great
economic losses which the Single Tax would save. ...</span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Think about what the value of land
is. It has no reference to the
cost of production, as has the value of houses, horses, ships,
clothes, or other things produced by labor, for land is not produced
by man, it was created by God. The value of land does not come from
the exertion of labor on land, for the value thus produced is a value
of improvement. That value attaches to any piece of land means that
that piece of land is more desirable than the land which other
citizens may obtain, and that they are willing to pay a premium for
permission to use it. Justice therefore requires that this premium of
value shall be taken for the benefit of all in order to secure to all
their equal rights.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Consider the difference between
the value of a building and the
value of land</b>. The value of a building, like the value of goods,
or of anything properly styled wealth, is produced by individual
exertion, and therefore properly belongs to the individual; but the
value of land only arises with the growth and improvement of the
community, and therefore properly belongs to the community.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> It is not
because of what its owners have done, but because of the presence of
the whole great population, that land in New York is worth millions
an acre. </span>This value therefore is the proper fund for defraying
the
common expenses of the whole population; and it must be taken for
public use, under penalty of generating land speculation and monopoly
which will bring about artificial scarcity where the Creator has
provided in abundance for all whom His providence has called into
existence.</small></p>

A. There is no place where land is cheap in the sense implied by the question.
Land commands a low price in many places, but it is poor land; it is not cheap
land. It is true that in Texas there is land that can be had for two dollars
an acre, but it would yield less profit to each unit of labor and capital expended
upon it than land in New York City which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars
an acre. The valuable New York land is the cheaper of the two. The land question
is the question in every place where land costs more than it is worth for immediate

accepted permitting death duties to be paid in land in certain

      <br>
      <small><b>Hiding the free
      lunch</b>
      </small><br>
      <small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil wins at the point where he
      convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
      Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
      kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
      invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
      mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well,
      breathlessly focused on their own
      particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
      land-price gains has become invisible.</span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
      are
      out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
      than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
      on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
      the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
      that no free lunch exists. But
      when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
      statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
      one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
      lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
      the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
      proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
      called
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
      characteristically in the form of land rent.
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
      appraising that undervalues the real
    income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two appraisal
      methods</b>
      </small><br>
      <small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways. Both start by estimating its
      market value.</small>
    </div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of
    buildings from this overall value, designating the remainder as the
    value of land.<strong>&nbsp; ...</strong></small></li>
      <li><small><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing
    the land,
    and treats the difference as representing the building's value.<strong> ...</strong></small></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
      appraisal methods do not
      acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
      price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
      driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
      as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
      around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
      rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
      built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
      acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
      up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
      ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
    changed in comparison to the property's overall value?</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve
      multiplies the building's original cost by the
      rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
      implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
      usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
      value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
    lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is agreed that any
      explanation of land/building relations
      should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
      same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
      property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
      <b><i>uniform</i></b> and <b><i>homogeneous</i></b> as possible. By
      that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
      price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
    accordingly.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
      accepted, then I believe that economists
      would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
    opposite usually is done.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>How land gets a
      negative value!</b>
      </small><br>
      <small>THE DRIVING FORCE behind the anomalies is the political lobbying
      eager to depict real estate gains simply as "protecting capital from
      inflation." In reality, it helps land owners and their creditors get
      a free ride out of land asset-price inflation -- that is, The
    Bubble.</small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... This leaves in limbo the
      macro-economists and business analysts
      whose business is to explain the <b>finance, insurance and real
      estate (FIRE)</b> sector's dominant role in the economy. According to
      the land-residual appraisal technique, high-rise buildings seem to
      have the lowest land values. Real estate interests argue that this is
      realistic, because at least in New York City the higher a building
      is, the more of a subsidy its developers need, given the economics of
      space involved for elevators, surrounding air space and so forth. The
      land itself is assigned a negative value as a statistically balancing
      residual reflecting the difference between the building's high
    construction costs and its lower market value.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On this basis much of New York's
      most highly built-up land would
      seem to have a negative value, including the World Trade Center even
      before its Sept. 11 destruction. While a low-rise building might be
      built on this site without subsidy, a skyscraper would need a
    subsidy, implying a negative land value.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Where did all the
      land value go?</b>
      </small><br>
      <small>AS REAL ESTATE AGENTS explain to prospective buyers, the three
      keys are "location, location, and location." So we are brought back
      to the role played by land-value gains in the strategy pursued by
      investors and developers. ...&nbsp; <a

    Mason Gaffney:<a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html"> Land as a
    Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a sort of supply
      response to increased demand for one use of land, and reduced demand
      for another, because land use can be changed in response to a new
      structure of rents.&nbsp; Many micro theorists, focusing narrowly on
      economics as "the allocation of limited resources among competing
      ends," advance this to aver that land is as mobile as capital.&nbsp;
      However, reallocating land has tight limits.&nbsp; It is uncommonly
      slow because land is mostly committed to existing uses, encumbered with
      durable capital specialized to the existing use, and as yet not fully
      depreciated.&nbsp; Only a fraction of the potential change occurs in
      one year.&nbsp; In addition, potential reallocation is often limited by
      the spatial fixity or other qualitative peculiarity of specific
      lands.&nbsp; Tundra and Alpine meadow cannot be converted to the loams
      and warm climate of the corn belt; Utica cannot move to Manhattan, nor
      Dubuque to Chicago, nor Death Valley to Newport Beach.&nbsp; The
      essence of land value is location; it is not easily duplicated, and of
      course totally stationary, by definition.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The most favorable case for supply response is where the growing
      use is of high value and the shrinking one of no value, as with a city
      growing out into a desert.&nbsp; Here the change of land use is even
      tantamount to increasing the aggregate supply, it is said or implied by
      some Chicago School theorists.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>One problem with such a model is that deserts do not spawn great
      cities: even Denver, Phoenix, Albuquerque, Salt Lake City and Los
      Angeles all developed in oases of intensive farming.&nbsp; As cities
      spread they destroy part of what they serve and what serves them, and
      the reverberations ripple out vastly.&nbsp; Land boundaries are common
      and interdependent, so a change in one ecotone entails "repacking"
      entire regions, a long, sticky, disruptive process indeed.&nbsp;
      Expanding cities send out shock waves into the surrounding farms that
      travel through the entire hierarchy of farm land uses, as higher uses
      displace lower uses, from market gardens down to sheep grazing.&nbsp;
      Even grazing is not the lowest use: it then pushes on forestry and
      recreation where it finally meets the wrath of the Sierra Club (with
      headquarters in downtown San Francisco and offices in Washington,
      D.C.). Growing cities also destroy part of the natural beauty that many
      people value so highly that they devote their lives to protecting it.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Las Vegas, not a typical city, is the largest I know of that
      indeed grows in worthless desert.&nbsp; Here another factor stands out
      clearly: new lands are peripheral and only imperfect, partial
      substitutes for central land.&nbsp; The city must range farther for
      water, power, waste disposal, raw materials and markets.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The high marginal cost of adding to spreading cities, and the
      low true net value of the additions, are concealed, in our culture, by
      an elaborate and pervasive system of subsidies and cross-subsidies
      built into our institutions and political power structures.&nbsp; These
      drain the old centers to feed the fringes.&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> In a systemwide accounting we find the
      true social cost of urban sprawl as we know it today to exceed the
      gains at the margins.&nbsp; We are not so much adding land to cities as
      wasting capital, dissipating central rents to do it.&nbsp; Thus the
      private rent gradient and resulting land-value gradient that we observe
      in the marketplace is much flatter than the true gradient that is
      hidden under the subsidies.&nbsp; Even so, the visible gradient remains
      impressive: values rise to $2,000/psf in San Francisco, Chicago and
      Manhattan, and $25,000/psf in Tokyo.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <small>Land of rare and limited qualities is often the basis of market
      control: retail sites, rights-of-way, rare ores, water rights, are
      familiar examples.&nbsp; Even land of less rare qualities is often used
      for market control.&nbsp; American farm output is controlled by means
      of acreage limitations; Texas and now OPEC oil production by oil well
      protates; and so on. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
      <br>
      <small>Land is traditionally subject to a host of legal and customary
      limits on use and ownership.&nbsp; Covenants are found in land titles:
      seldom in titles to cars or canned goods.&nbsp; Divided ownership is
      common, there is so much about land to be owned.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
      easements through, air rights over, mineral rights under, and neighbors
      and zoning all around any parcel of land.&nbsp; Changing lot lines is
      unavoidably a social process, there is no other way.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A large share of the more
      valuable land in cities is held by estates.&nbsp;</span> Public and
      eleemosynary [non-profit] holders are preferentially tax exempt and
      often without any visible motive to economize.&nbsp; Water licenses are
      held subject to "use it or lose it" traditions leading to appalling
      waste.&nbsp; Broadcasting/telecasting licenses are highly
      political.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; Only a resource with the
      characteristics of land could be subject to such a wide range of
      non-economic pressures.... <a

      Several modern economists minimize the role of land prices in home
      values. Thomas Sowell, now a voguish columnist, was only recently a
      Professor of Economics at U.C.L.A.&nbsp; Sowell endorses Professors
      Edward L. Glaeser of Harvard and Joseph E. Gyourko of the Wharton
      School, whom he quotes as follows: "America is not facing a nationwide
      affordable housing crisis. --- In large areas of the country housing
      costs are quite close to the cost of new construction." These areas
"represent the bulk of American housing" and they are areas where "land
      is quite cheap." I can&#8217;t confirm the quote, but it reads like something
      Glaeser and Gyourko might have written: they also claim that the
      apparent price of land in Manhattan is only an illusion, the product of
      zoning laws.&nbsp; The true or &#8220;hedonic&#8221; price is not much above
      farmland.&nbsp; How do they figure that?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t ask!&nbsp; It&#8217;s
      exclusionary obscurantism at its worst.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>In a Brookings paper, housing authority Karl Case of Wellesley
      and
      financial prophet Robert Shiller of Yale write on housing. This is a
      hasty paper, not of the same quality as their previous work, but there
      it is under their names.&nbsp; They write that housing became more
      affordable from 1995 to 2003 &#8220;in the vast majority of states.&#8221;&nbsp;
      Thus easily they dismiss the minority of states with the majority of
      the U.S. population and land values, and the highest ratio of land
      prices to building prices.&nbsp; Metropolitan New York, with 10% of the
      U.S. population, and a higher percentage of its land value, is a big
      chunk of the U.S.A. all by itself.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>3,000 miles west, Deborah Reid of the Public Policy Institute of
      California delivers a parallel locution: &#8220;there is no housing shortage
      in California outside of Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and San
      Diego.&#8221;&nbsp; Yes, and Switzerland is all flat, outside of The
      Alps.&nbsp; Is this a new conventional wisdom to help vitriolic
      columnists like Sowell ignore land values?&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land, in an economic sense, is
      defined as the entire material
      universe outside of people themselves and the products of people. It
      includes all natural resources, materials, airwaves, as well as the
      ground. All air, soil, minerals and water is included in the
      definition of land. Everything that is freely supplied by nature, and
      not made by man, is categorized as land.
    </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land holds a unique and pivotal
      position in social, political,
      environmental and economic theory. Land supports all life and stands
      at the center of human culture and institutions. All people, at all
      times, must make use of land. Land has no cost of production. It is
      nature's gift to mankind, which enables life to continue and
    prosper.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land's uniqueness stems from its
      fixed supply and immobility. Land
      cannot be manufactured or reproduced. Land is required directly or
      indirectly in the production of all goods and services. Land is our
    most basic resource and the source of all wealth.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price paid
      annually for the exclusive right (a
      monopoly) to use a certain location, piece of land or other natural
      resource. People receive wages for work, capital receives interest
      for investment, and land receives rent for the exclusive use of a
      location. Equity and efficiency require that the local general
      public, who created land value, should be paid for the exclusive use
      of a land site. That Payment is in the form of a land tax.
    </small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When considering world-wide
      economics, most people think that land
      rent contributes only a small insignificant portion of value.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> But as
      societies progress, land has become the predominant force in
      determining the progress or poverty of all people within a community.
      Land in major or cities is so costly that people are forced to move
      further away and travel great distances in order to get to work and
      social attractions.</span> In the more developed countries of the
      world,
      land rent represents more than 40% of gross annual production.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><b>UTILITY, SCARCITY
      AND DESIRABILITY </b></small><br>
      <small>Land value can be thought of as the relationship between a
      desired
      location and a potential user. The ingredients that constitute land
      value are utility, scarcity and desirability. These factors must all
    be present for land to have value.</small> ... </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land that lacks utility and
      scarcity also lacks value, since
      utility arouses desire for use and has the power to give
      satisfaction. The air we breathe has utility and is generally
      considered important, since it sustains and nourishes life. However,
      in the economic sense, air is not valuable because it hasn't been
      appropriated and there is enough for everyone. Thus there is no
      scarcity -- at least at the moment. This may not be true in the
      future, however, as knowledge of air pollution and its effect on
      human health make people aware that clean and breathable air may
    become scarce and subsequently valuable.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By themselves, utility and
      scarcity confer no value on land. User
      desire backed up by the ability to pay value must also exist in order
      to constitute effective demand. The potential user must be able to
    participate in the market to satisfy their desire.</small><span

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>HIGHEST AND BEST USE
      OF LAND </b></small><br>
      <small>A land site should be made available to the users who can make
      the
      highest and best effective use of the site and maximize the site
      benefits for all people. The proper system of assessment and taxation
      of land can provide for the proper economic use of the land. A high
      land tax on an improperly improved site tends to cause the site
      holder to either better improve his site to obtain greater return
      with which to pay the land tax, or to look for someone else with the
      means to properly improve the site. A land tax can also provide the
      source of public revenue which the local governing body could use for
      the benefit of all people. Before an assessment can proceed, the
      highest and best use must be determined for each site.</small>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The economics of production should
      provide the atmosphere for the
      most efficient use to be made of all land. The assessment process is
      based on the highest, best and most profitable use of land. The
      highest and best use considers only the uses that are legally
      permissible (meeting zoning, health, and public restrictions),
      physically possible (has adequate size, soil conditions, and
      accessibility), and is economically feasible (income is anticipated).
      The use that meets these criteria and produces the greatest net
    earnings (best returns) is the highest and best use.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE SOURCE OF PUBLIC
      REVENUE </b></small><br>
      <small>What are the factors that cause land to have market value and to
      whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
    market value for three reasons: </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
    productivity of the soil and natural resources, 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>the publicly provided
    services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
    value of land and 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>the growth of communities and peoples' competitive
    demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that
      people and businesses are willing to
      pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
      period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
      location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
      travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
      businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
      day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.
    </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
      be used as revenue, by the
      community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
      individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
      site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
      have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
    for the period of time.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><small></small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>HOW MUCH LAND RENT
      SHOULD THE COMMUNITY COLLECT? </b></small>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In order to preserve the
      environment, it is necessary and possible
      to better utilize our communities. If the producers of the land
      market value (nature, government and people) don't utilize land rent,
      someone else will. This is why efficient land use fails under
      contemporary land systems in most countries. All countries collect
      some of the land rent, perhaps 10%, 20% or 30%, but none yet, collect
    all of the market rent of land.</small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Studies have been produced that
      demonstrate that communities
      prosper and succeed in proportion to the percentage of the land rent
      that they collect. The first communities that decide to collect all
      of the ground rent will have an enormous competitive advantage over
      all other communities. They will be able to reduce or eliminate
      regressive taxes on labor and capital. They will attract new business
    and industry and become prosperous.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>To determine how much land rent
      the community should collect
      let's consider the alternatives. Whatever is not collected will be
      capitalized into market value by land owners. Buying land at inflated
      market prices is a block to new industry. Land owners sell the
      capitalized land rent (known as land value) which is uncollected by
      the community even though it is unearned income. This causes a
      disparity between landowners and non-landowners. In the United States
      5% of the population, which does not include many homeowners or
      farmers, own 70% of the total national land and natural resource
    values.</b></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>People will come to a well run
      community because they will be
      better off than living by themselves or in an impoverished locale. A
      city must secure revenue in order to provide good quality
    services.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This revenue can best be procured
      when the community recaptures
      the value of the benefits and services that it provides. This is done
      by collecting the rental revenue from land that reflects the value of
      the services and facilities provided in that community. The land rent
      belongs equally to all people that live in the locale who helped to
      produce that value. In a well run community. there is sufficient land
      rent to provide adequate funding for the social purposes requested
    of, and provided by, the local city government</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cities which choose to collect
      land rent as their primary source
      of revenue have the advantage of not requiring burdensome taxes to be
      paid by workers, businesspeople, entrepreneurs or citizens.
      Individuals who work to create wealth should be allowed to keep what
      they produce. When labor is not taxed, greater production and
      consumption occurs. Investment capital is formed which is used to
      produce more wealth. New jobs are created and economic diversity
    results.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Each person has a right to keep
      what he or she produces, but no
      one has the right to waste what belongs to all people, the land which
      includes the natural environment. Each person should have an
      opportunity to use the best land for his business or personal needs,
      as long as they are willing to pay the land rent that other land
    users are willing to pay.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the value of land rent exceeds
      the community's needs for public
      services a method of dispensing of the surplus revenue can easily be
      found. To maintain an equitable society, where nobody has special
      benefits that they do not pay for, it is important to collect all of
      the land rent. The community should use what is needed for public
      services and improvements such as schools, hospitals, parks, police,
      roadways, utilities and defense -- and reserve a fund for
    emergencies.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An ethical proposal might be to
      then divide the excess revenue
      that is not needed for public facilities and services at the end of
      each year and send each citizen in that community an equal portion of
      the remaining revenue. This is similar to the method used in Alaska
      and Alberta. Equality of opportunity to be productive can only be
      accomplished by recapturing all of the market rent of land and
    ensuring that all people benefit from its value.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent potentially
      an important source of public
      revenue, collecting all of it would ensure that the equal opportunity
      to be productive would be available to all citizens. People could
      fund useful buildings, equipment and wages, rather than having to buy
      land at inflated prices. Many countries, including the United States,
      were started on the premise of using land rent to fund public
      services. Many countries suffer economic loss because they no longer
    collect the market rent of land.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The value of land can be estimated
      with an acceptable accuracy, at
      a cost which is very small compared to the revenue to be obtained. A
      proper system of assessment and taxation of land can provide for the
      proper economic use of the land. A land site should be available to
      the user who can make the highest and best use of the site and
      maximize the site benefits for all people. A land tax can provide a
      major source of public revenue which the local governing body could
      use for the benefit of all people. A land tax can prevent the
      dispossession of our children, the future producers in the society.
      Justice requires that land values, which are created by society and
      nature, be made available for public improvements. This is the
      responsibility of good government.<a

    <p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington
        and the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
        argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity,
        and are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained
        them from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and
        natural resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every
        one of the N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal
        beds, 1/Nth of the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile
        soil. God wills a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own
        vine and his own fig tree.</p>
      <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership
        of land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in
        the absence of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale
        of land. (See Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his
        land is sell the use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared
        once every fifty years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned
        to its hereditary owner.</p>
      <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
        of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his
        bookkeeping expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally
        among the natural owners of the land, viz. the people of the country,
        with everyone receiving a dividend check regularly for the use of his
        share of the earth (here I am anticipating what I think George would
        have suggested if he had written in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
      <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
        of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements
        on it, practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not
        the original sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose
        to hold his &quot;fair share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay
        a land tax about equal to his dividend check, and so would break even.
        By 1/Nth of the land is meant land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the
        value of all the land in the country.</p>
      <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be
        worth as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer
        to hold more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some
        would prefer to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual
        check representing the dividend on their inheritance from their father
        Adam.</p>
      <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of
        poverty at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are
        enough to feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the
        land and 1/Nth of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the
        population. A family of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what
        their dividend checks will enable them to pay the tax on) will find that
        their labor applied to that land is enough to enable them to feed and
        clothe themselves. Of course, they may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere
        more profitably, but the situation from which we start is one in which
        everyone has his own plot of ground from which to wrest a living by the
        strength of his own back, and any deviation from this is the result of
        voluntary exchanges agreed to by the parties directly involved, who judge
        themselves to be better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
      <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is
        extremely conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic
        ideas about land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or
        vehicles or gold or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking
        countries uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal
        property (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not
        the opposite of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
        means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the
        people. Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
        term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that
        the landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
        for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to
        property other than land, although complications arise when there are
        buildings on the land that is being seized.</p>
      <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
        support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
        Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
        Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
        F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized
        by Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and
        the Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight
        of the Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of
        the proposals of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton
        Friedman</a>, 1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco
        Modigliani, 1985; James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
        S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
      <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
        cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
        tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is
        about to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value
        of the land and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure
        you that real estate assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice
        to make the two assessments separately, and a parcel of land in the business
        district of a large city very often has a different owner from the building
        on it.) Many cities have moved to a system of taxing land more heavily
        than improvements, and most have been pleased with the results, finding
        that landholders are more likely to use their land productively -- to
        their own benefit and that of the public -- if their taxes do not automatically
        go up when they improve their land by constructing or maintaining buildings
        on it.</p>
      <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
        proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental
        and reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results
        of a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the
        difference in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other
        proposals of the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me
        absolute dictator of the world so that I can supervise the distribution,
        and if it doesn't work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that
        absolute dictators seldom resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read

    <div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Rent in Cities</strong></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">The land values are highest in urban cores, one is reminded, because the
            economic rent passes as a surplus through all market transactions and comes
            to settle on land sites. Rent happens, so to speak, and it raises the market
            price of sites accordingly. Were cities to recover the socially produced
            ground rent in the form of tax revenue, it would not be left to collect
            on sites but could be used to provide the financial wherewithal for the
            services that cities are bound to perform. As will be evident below, the
            amount of economic rent available for recovery is thought sufficient to
            pay for all services and then some. Today it simply collects on sites of
            greatest activity with typical and visible negative consequences.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>One might suppose that collecting the economic rent would leave locational
              sites with less market price appreciation, stabilizing land prices at levels
              that are more within reach for various developments. To be sure collecting
              economic rent exerts a downward pressure on market prices. But there is
              a countervailing pressure that works to neutralize whatever tendencies
              are otherwise at work: the collection of rent, especially from high-value
              sites, increases the carrying costs in ways that provides a greater inducement
              for their titleholders to improve them. That incentive fosters development
              in areas that, together in combination with other activity generated in
              neighborhoods, tends to maintain the stability of land markets in a roughly
              constant pattern.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]</em></strong></font></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately the positive effect of taxing rent in the typical American
              city is neutralized by the fact that taxes are also imposed upon improvements.
              Even though taxing land sites fosters their more intensive use, taxing
              buildings exerts a penalty on titleholders for doing so that works in the
              opposite direction. The conventional tax on real property in most American
              cities is like a train with an engine at each end. Whatever beneficial
              effects that might be apparent by taxing just land value are taken away
              again by the tax on improvements. This is why so many cities suffer from
              abandonment and despoliation. It is also why titleholders so often revile
              the conventional property tax. Were the tax on improvements gradually phased
              out and the tax on land values raised proportionately in a revenue-neutral
              manner, underused parcel owners would be induced to make improvements and
              sites would be built upon commensurate with their market price.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[12]</em></strong></font> This
              practice is increasingly employed by municipalities both in the US and
            beyond.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Taxing land value only is an incentive with the virtue of reversing the
              centrifugal forces of sprawl development and the tendency for builders
              to choose suboptimal locations.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Some
              titleholders find it advantageous to hold their valuable parcels off the
              market for speculative gain. But bringing the holding costs forward rather
              than allowing their exploitation for a capital gain upon sale increases
              the market efficiency of transactions and more optimal use of sites. The
            incentive to speculate on others' dime is removed.</p>
        </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">Cities, having the huge preponderance of
        land value, stand most to gain by a shift of taxes to land value alone.
        If they
        wished
                    they could &quot;cream&quot; the
                  tax base in a way that would make outermost locations positively
                    jealous. Contrary to the thesis of writers like David Rusk
                    who argue for incorporating
                  the suburbs to the cities to expand the tax base,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15]</em></strong></font> it
                  is the urban cores that have the greatest tax base in the form
                  of high ground rent. Preliminary studies indicate that the
                  amount of economic rent

                    Value Taxation</a>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... To a land economist, the
                    land value and any building value must be
                    regarded separately: each has its own economic dynamic. As to the land
                    component, one must understand that the value of that site is due not
                    to how the owner uses it but rather due to the activity of the whole
                    neighborhood or even the region. Any value which a land parcel accrues
                    above the cost of its creation is due to the accretion of what
                    economists call economic rent. The word rent has a very different
                    meaning than that used in everyday discourse. Since the community is
                    responsible for the rise or fall in the value of a land site, or rather
                    of all those in the neighborhood, any increase in the value of that
                    location can be reclaimed by that community more than by the
                    titleholder alone. Were it not for the accretion of land rent on a
                    parcel, all land would have the same market value.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>When one looks at the value of land in any broad way, its value
                    will be
                    highest at the center and falls as one looks out to the frontier. The
                    highest value land, that with the greatest accrued rent, is at the very
                    center of the city -- usually where the commercial parcels are located.
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the spring of 1998, one land parcel
                    (the building was to be razed)
                    of less than an acre and split in two pieces in New York City's Times
                    Square was sold by Prudential Life to Disney for an estimated $240
            million,</span><small style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">19</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
            more than the value of all the land and buildings together in the lands
                    north of the Mohawk River/Erie Canal in New York State. </span>The
                    highest
                    value land is
                    typically surrounded by a belt of residential areas, and with farmlands
                    starting at the fringe. The more valuable parcels are taxed, the more
                    their titleholders will find ways to recover their carrying costs. And
                    it cannot affect the behavior of tenants as any change in burden is not
                    passed through. In this sense,
                    land value taxation fosters clustered development and reverses the
                    egregious patterns of sprawl. Jessica Matthews, now with the Council on
          Foreign Relations, recently wrote a syndicated piece observing that, </small></div>
      <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><br>
            In a now familiar sequence, developers reach for the cheapest land, out
                    in the cow pastures. Government is left to fill in behind with
                    brand-new infrastructure -- roads, sewerage systems and schools -- paid
                    for in part by those whose existing roads and schools are left to
                    decline. Property values rise in a ring that marches steadily outward
                    from the city and fall in older suburbs inside the moving edge.
          </small></div>
      <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><br>
            Because residential development can't meet the public bills, local
                    governments compete for commercial investment with tax discounts that
                    deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes then rise,
                    providing an incentive for new development.
          </small></div>
      <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><br>
            Years of such leapfrogging construction devours land at an astonishing
          pace.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small></small></div>

            <small>Taxing high value land parcels encourages their efficient use.
                    The
                    highest value parcels will then be settled at sufficient density that
                    public transportation services become economically viable -- experts
                    recognize that it typically takes at least 10-12 households per acre
                    for this to happen.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">21</span></small> This
                    both relieves dependency upon motor vehicle transportation and enhances
                    the livability of communities. Taxing land alone also removes the
                    penalty for titleholders who want to improve their properties. Under
                    current property tax structures, one is penalized if one adds a garage,
                    an extra wing of rooms, or in any way makes an upgrade. This is
                    perverse: when people maintain and improve their homes and other
          buildings it is a social and economic benefit.</small><small><small></small></small></div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
            <small>Taxing land by its value has many economic advantages. The first
                    is
                    that it is equitable: those who have title to the most land value will
                    pay the most taxes; those who have no land pay no taxes. Because <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/Not_Passed_On.html">a tax
                    on land alone cannot be passed on to tenants</a>, this means that all
                    those
                    households that do not own their own home will pay no taxes. Nationally
                    only 65 percent of households are homeowners; in New York State, it's
          only 52 percent.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">22</span></small></small><small><small></small></small></div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
            <small>And since we know that it is typically the wealthier element of
                    the
                    society that owns there is a certain fairness in this. Of those parcels
                    that currently pay taxes on their real property, about half are
                    homeowners, and the remainder are commercial, industrial, and
                    agricultural titleholders. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Agricultural
                    parcels </span>typically have very little market value because their
                    location is so remote; they would have little if any tax burden. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Commercial
                    parcels</span>, in contrast, are usually sited in very high value
                    locations, and therefore would pay the most. A shift of taxes away from
                    buildings and onto land alone typically relieves homeowners, and adds
                    to the burden of high value parcels (usually in commercial cores) that
                    are underused relative to their value -- fully depreciated structures,
                    parking lots, drive-in banks, gas stations, fast food services, and so
            on. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_Merits_SVT.html"><span

            <small>John Houseman, an actor perhaps most widely known as Professor
                    Kingsfield in the long-running TV series, The Paper Chase, later became
                    the pitchman for Smith Barney. In that advertisement, his tag line was
"We make money the old-fashioned way -- we earn it."</small><br>

            <small>That we should earn our money rather than live off the efforts
                    of
                    others seems a simple enough moral tenet. But it seems to have lost its
                    cogency in contemporary economic thought. More than a century ago John
            Stuart Mill noted that</small><br>

                    grow richer in their sleep
                    without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
                    land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
                    should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold

            <small>Today, on the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
                    unearned surplus which classical
                    economists called rent</span> attaches to monopoly titles -- largely
                    the
                    scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
                    totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
                    vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
                    recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
                    comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
                    eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
                    the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
                    explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
                    efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span

                    such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,

                    only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
                    Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
                    luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
                    million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an

                    to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
                    a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
                    mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
                    direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
                    attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
                    areas. Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in the

                    proportion of the total number of square miles because most of it is

                    relative to their location, and this is largely a

                    recently, a nine-acre parcel just south of the United Nations complex,

            <br>
            <small>Rent becomes critically important in Georgist economics,
                    because rent is the increment of market gain that accrues to choice
                    land parcels. This insight arose originally in the context of
                    agricultural societies, where differential qualities of land were
                    recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
                    investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone to
                    keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the
                    efforts of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a
                    higher yield separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment
                    might represent, this constituted a windfall gain above and beyond what
                    might be minimally expected. This is land rent, and it exists even if
                    it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as earlier noted, the greatest land rents
            derive from their location, grown out of nearby social investment.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The concept of rent needs further explication precisely because
                    it is
                    so foreign to 20th century students, even those who have been schooled
                    in economics at it is currently taught. Land rent has no relationship
                    to the word rent as it is used in contemporary vernacular, that is,
                    when one rents a car or an apartment. Rather, rent is a surplus,
                    defined as the return on investment above and beyond what is minimally
                    required to bring a service into production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To take just an elementary example,
                    consider that there are three parcels of land available for farming and
                    three farmers of equal ability and enterprise.</span> But suppose the
                    parcels differ in their productive capacity, due perhaps to their
                    fertility, access to water, and so on. If planted with similar quality
                    seed, the three parcels will yield different quantities of harvest, the
                    one with the highest quality land having the best return. The one with
                    the lowest quality land would in like fashion have the&nbsp;lowest
                    return. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Economic rent is defined as
                    the amount of surplus harvest
                    qualitatively measured by the difference between the parcel with the
            highest return and that with the lowest return.</span></small><br>
            <br>
            <small><small></small>
            Even though its originator, David Ricardo, had in mind the differential
                    return from agricultural lands, the concept of rent applies to other
                    natural services as well. Consider what happens in the case of urban
                    communities, using the simplest comparison with a tic-tac-toe board.
                    When the lattice is completely undeveloped and consists only of vacant
                    land squares, the locational sites have inconsequential value. But let
                    us suppose that each square is then settled &#8212; the first by a hotel, the
                    second by a department store, the third by a restaurant and so on &#8212; and
                    supposing that the owner of the center square is reticent to build at
                    all. Reserving his prerogative as titleholder he may intend ultimately
                    to sell. Given the rules of economics as they apply today he may be
                    wise to do so, keeping his money for other uses, as his square will
                    have increased in market value more than all the others despite his
                    having done nothing to improve it. It was this that prompted John
                    Stuart Mill to observe that &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep
                    without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
                    land, aris[es] from the efforts of an entire community.. . .&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> As
                    will be discussed later below, the single greatest factor in
                    determining the economic rental value of land today results not from
                    nutrients or access to water but rather due to site value determined by
            location. And that can be priced and collected easily.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Lastly, one must appreciate that the market value of &#8220;land&#8221; of
                    every
                    sort is entirely rent, as there is no human factor of labor that
                    accounts for its origination. Services of nature have no prior cost to
                    bring them into production existence &#8212; the electromagnetic spectrum,
                    for example, exists regardless of human presence on earth and so
                    presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy metals are
                    all found in nature, not the result of human creation. They are, in
                    19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor but of
                    God&#8217;s. And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative on earth &#8212;
            the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as much as it was their
                    role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of the land. That
                    bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements, was an
                    equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of rent
                    collection and the exploitation of land without
                    recognition of its price. The practice effectively ended with what in
                    Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign,
                    driving the peasants off the land into cities to provide cheap labor
                    for the early English industrialists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But
                    the theory continued long afterwards. Georgists today argue that land
                    rent should be collected from titleholders so that it is not left to
                    render economic distortions. This in turn affects the price of labor
                    and the price of money. Government&#8217;s role, whatever else it does, is at
                    the very least responsible for defending the commons, to ascertain
                    titles and to collect rent. Although there are many differences about
                    the proper role, scope and domain of government among Georgist
                    adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
            is central to its tenets.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Any failure to pay back that increment to society, or of
                    government to
                    recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
                    the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. He witnessed first
                    hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development &#8212; even in his
                    time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
                    held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. He
                    witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
                    of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
                    prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
                    supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
                    himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
                    strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
                    burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
                    pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
                    labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
                    recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
                    growth of capital. He realized that people who captured monopoly
                    control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
                    were privy to information prior to its public release. It was not by
                    any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington

                    landholders as its rightful due, a solution that became part of the
                    subtitle of his book, &#8220;the remedy.&#8221; Taxing the land (or, alternatively,
                    collecting the economic rent) was something common citizens could
            understand.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The collection of land rent has other consequences for the
                    smooth and
                    effective functioning of the economy as well. With respect to the
                    configurations of land use in urban areas, the collect of land rent
                    neutralizes, and even reverses, the centrifugal forces which the
                    current real property tax (i.e. that on both land and improvements)
                    exerts on the values of locational sites. In fact one eminent economist
                    argues that a tax on land sites is &#8220;better than neutral,&#8221; because it
                    fosters activity in the highest value areas and removes the factor of
                    adverse timing that often stalls economic investment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">51</span></small> This
                    all leads to the economic vitality of high-land-value cities, simply by
                    virtue of concentrating activity in central areas instead of peripheral
                    and remote regions. It discourages the extravagant and careless
                    development of land sites,
                    thereby also fostering development densities conducive to community
                    welfare and to the success of public transit services.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">52</span></small>
            Experts agree that the minimum density necessary to make public transit
                    services economically viable is 10 to 12 households per acre; without
                    this, there is little prospect of altering private automobile
                    dependency.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">53</span></small>
            And given the widespread environmentally and socially destructive
                    consequences of motor vehicle dependency, collecting rent is half the
                    answer toward the goal of engendering livable urban areas. (The other
                    half &#8212; see below &#8212; is pricing motor vehicle use at its true marginal
          cost to society.) ... <a

      <p><strong>Land Rent</strong></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"> 
      <p>From the standpoint of an economic geographer and for some land economists,
              land rent is simply capitalized transportation cost. Land rent is the surplus
              generated by social activity on or in the vicinity of locational sites
              that accrues to titleholders of those parcels. Whether or not it is recaptured
              by public policy, rent is a natural factor deriving from the intensive
              use of natural capital. One must return to nineteenth-century classical
              economics to appreciate the importance of economic rent or land rent; neoclassical
              economic frameworks have largely discarded it.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font> More
              intensive use of high-value land sites leads to site configurations
              that are less dependent on transportation services. Land rent is
              highest where
              the greatest traffic and market exchanges occur, that being at
              the center of large conurbations. Comparing land values of urban
              property
              parcels,
              the highest land rent in the urban cores and traffic junctures
              are analogous to the contours of land elevations. Mountain peaks
              gradually
              slope down
              to valleys and flatland regions and continue outward until at distant
              points &#8212; perhaps
              at the poles of the earth &#8212; land sites have no market value
              at all.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">The differentials in land values are profound, even more than most people
            realize. In 1995, in the small city of Ithaca, New York, the highest quintile
            of land had a value of over $56,000 per acre in the downtown center, whereas
            the lowest quintile only a mile away falls to less than $3,000.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Large
            city centers have far higher site prices. Even in Polk County, Iowa (which
            includes Des Moines), in the middle of cornfields where I did a study two
            years ago, the highest urban value land site was $31.3 million per acre,
            which quickly declined to about $20,000 per acre only about a mile away.
            In the spring of 1998, one land parcel (the building was to be razed) of
            less than an acre in New York City's Times Square and split in two pieces
            by Broadway was sold by Prudential Life to Disney for roughly $240 million.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15]</em></strong></font> To
            take another instance, a nine-acre tract on the East River in New York
            City occupied by an obsolete power plant was purchased by Mort Zuckerman
            to build high-rise condominiums two years ago. The sale price was in the
            neighborhood of $680 million and would have been higher were it not for
            some enormous costs associated with the demolition of the old structures.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[16]</em></strong></font> It
            should be noted that the overwhelming proportion of land value is in cities;
            relatively speaking, the site values of peripheral lands, typically used
            for agriculture and timber growth, are negligible. Land values are high
            in urban areas because, over time, rent accrues to a site. Each improvement
            in proximity to a property parcel enhances the value of all other parcels.
            This makes even unimproved sites attractive objects for speculation, particularly
            when land sites surrounding it are to be improved by adding either transportation
            service or new structures. One nine-mile stretch of interstate highway
            in Albany, New York, costing $125 million to construct, has yielded $3.8
            billion in increased land values (constant dollars) within just two miles
            of its corridor in the forty years of its existence.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17]</em></strong></font> This
            is a thirty-fold return in a time span typically used for bond repayment!
            The Washington Metro created increments in land value along much of the
            101-mile system completed by 1980 that easily exceeded $3.5 billion, compared
            with the $2.7 billion of federal funds invested in Metro up until that
            time.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[18]</em></strong></font> Any major building
            construction project, private or public, will have a similar effect on
            adjacent land sites. Differentials in land value can have a profound effect
            on decisions made by titleholders, either positively by inducing appropriate
            development in urban cores or negatively by giving monopoly titleholders
            power to hold sites out of use for long-term speculative gain. Such decisions
            of course determine the character of urban configurations and society as
            well. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></div>

    landowners of Britain. Remember, it&#8217;s not the acreage of land that is
    important, but the value of the land. Australia doesn&#8217;t have quite the
    disparities of land wealth of Britain, being a newly-settled/colonised
    country, but each so-called property &#8220;boom&#8221; in Australia is widening
    the gulf between the haves and the havenots. </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>But the rewards of land go far beyond status, evidenced by how,
    over
    the centuries, the land-owning elite has pulled the levers of power in
    society, politics and the world of commerce. The Earl of Derby&#8217;s 1881
    candid analysis of the benefits of owning land perhaps says it best, </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>&#8220;One, political influence; 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>two, social importance; 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>three, power exercised over tenantry;</small></li>
      <li><small>four, residential enjoyment including what is called
    sport; 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>five, the money return &#8211; the rent.&#8221;</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since then, the reform of the
    House of Lords has dented the political
    influence that was previously wielded by the landowning class (titles
    and land were once synonymous). But who needs status? &#8211; let&#8217;s get crass
    and just go for the cash. The great windfall profits which are dropped
    into landowners&#8217; laps (which rightly belongs to the community) occurs
    with rezoning and the growth in residential/industrial values. In the
    UK between 1991 and 2001, the total return by this measure (including
    capital growth and rental income) averaged a healthy 12.6% per year.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The gross injustice of handing over community-created values to
    landowners is revealed by cold, hard figures. According to Yolande
    Barnes, head of research at FPD Savills, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the average UK building plot &#8211;
    at &pound;709,650 for a greenfield acre &#8211; is worth around 403 times the
    equivalent agricultural land. </span>Nationwide, through this form of
    rezoning, around &pound;5bn. windfall profit is handed over to UK
    landowners each year.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Barnes explains further, &#8220;In many parts of the South and
    Southeast, it
    is certainly true that prices are paid for agricultural land that
    wouldn&#8217;t be justified by its agricultural value.&#8221; ... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">farmers buy around
    towns because they can&#8217;t lose. They&#8217;ll farm the land anyway, and if
    permission is given to build, they&#8217;ve won the lottery. </span></small><br

    gets rich the easy way -- he has his

    his net worth sky high &#8211; to be exact, UK&pound;11.5 billion. To give
    him his full title, he is <span style="font-weight: bold;">His Grace,

    Sixth Duke of Westminster</span>.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Forget the vast tracts of rural land, including a 100,000-acre
    estate
    in Scotland which contains no less than three mountains. <span

    the duke owns in central London,</span> comprising Mayfair and
    Belgravia, are
    today one of the most valuable patches of ground on the planet.&nbsp;

&pound;335m.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></small><br>

    <small>Is it any wonder that, given how there is little or no land

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We do not propose a tax upon
land, as people who misapprehend us
constantly say. We do not propose a tax upon land; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">we propose a tax
upon land values, or what in the terminology of political economy is
termed rent; that is to say, the value which attaches to land
irrespective of any improvements &#8212; in or on it; that value which
attaches to land, not by reason of anything that the user or improver
of land does &#8212; not by reason of any individual exertion of labour,
but by reason of the growth and improvement of the community. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">A tax
that will take up what John Stuart Mill called the unearned
increment;</span> that is to say, that increment of wealth which comes
to
the owner of land, not as a user; that comes whether he be a resident
or an absentee; whether he be engaged in the active business of life;
whether he be an idiot and whether he be a child; that growth of
value that we have seen in our own times so astonishingly great in
this city; that has made sand lots, lying in the same condition that
they were thousands of years ago, worth enormous sums, without anyone
putting any exertion of labour or any expenditure of capital upon
them. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now, the distinction between a
tax on land and a tax on land
values may at first seem an idle one, but it is a most important one.
A tax on land that is to say, a tax upon all land &#8212; would
ultimately become a condition to the use of land; would therefore
fall upon labour, would increase prices, and be borne by the general
community. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But a tax on land values
cannot fall on all land, because
all land is not of value; it can only fall on valuable land, and on
valuable land in proportion to its value;</span> therefore, it can no
more
become a tax on labour than can a tax upon the value of special
privileges of any kind. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It can merely
take from the individual, not
the earnings of the individual, but that premium which, as society
grows and improves, attaches to the use of land of superior
quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1955, Spiro Agnew was a
Maryland State Assemblyman on the
rise.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> He carried a new law that let
tax assessors value farmland on its
"use-value" as farmland, instead of market value. It let owners who
were farming for unearned increments around Baltimore and D.C. hold
out with low carrying costs.</span> "Farmland" meant land used for
farming,
and any play at farming would qualify. Under this law, a relative of
mine with 102 acres in Maryland near Western Avenue, the D.C. line,
kept just two steers thereon to validate his farmland assessment
status. Holding for the rise "never crossed his mind." Right --
except, whenever such land is condemned for public use, courts
everywhere have held that compensation must be based on speculative
market value. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is not just peri-urban land speculators who
gain. A large
chunk of land value in rural regions is not based on cash flow from
food and fiber, but on amenities. Wisconsin is a major playground
for rich urbanites from nearby Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and
St. Paul. "Use-value" assessment exempts this chunk of value
completely, for use-value is based on capitalizing the net cash farm
income from growing crops, and, in the Wisconsin law, specifically
corn. The highest land values per capita in the State are in Vilas
County up in the north woods, once dismissed as worthless "cutovers."
Vilas' barren podzol soils are worthless for corn, but sparkling
lakes bedizen the County. Values per capita in Vilas are 6 times
those in Milwaukee. Rich recreationists and "investors" (read
speculators) are gobbling up the "wild forties." Shoreline parcels
are like diamonds among coal. <strong>... </strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">100
years ago, American
Georgists made a big point that city land

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The privilege of use-value
assessment stretches even beyond
farmlands, vast as they are. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Timberland
</span>in most states gets the
same preferred treatment, only better. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">About 1/3 of
the privately
owned land in the U.S. is in timber. </span>In California, owners
(mostly
huge corporations) may put the land into the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">"TPZ"</span> class. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
standing timber is then exempt, and taxed only at harvest, at 2.9%,
much too low a rate to make up for a 60-year lifetime of exemption.</span>
County assessors have to value the land separately on its putative
value for growing timber, following a State-legislated formula that
is tailored drastically to understate even that low value (California
Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Much
of that land, though, has
alternative uses, e.g. for retirement and vacation homes and resorts,
the outliers and pioneers of urban sprawl. There are also mineral
values, hunting, fishing, rifle ranges, grazing, campsites, tourism,
rights of way, lumber camps, loading sites, water sources, lakes, log
storage, landings - there are many things to do with 1/3 of a
nation's land. <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Those uses are
all declared "compatible" with timber,
hence land values derived therefrom are tax-exempt.&nbsp; </span></span></small><small

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Differences among city tax bases
are actually, however, extreme. One
desperate little farm town in Fresno County, Parlier, has just
$10,000 of assessed value per head. Here are some assessed values
per head from different California cities in The County of Los
Angeles:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Lynwood, $21,500; </small></li>
  <li><small>Beverly Hills, $294,000 (13 times Lynwood); </small></li>
  <li><small>City of Industry, $5,533,000 (257 times Lynwood, and 553
times
Parlier) . </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Destitute Slab City (Unincorp.) in
Riverside County has no land
values at all. (It is an abandoned military base between a bombing
range and the fragrant southern end of the Salton Sea, with rotting
algae and dying fish.) One would not expect much support in The
City of Industry for a proposal to share land as common property with
the transients who park in Slab City, which has no public services
except a species of public schooling, nor would we expect the
transients to stay in or return to Slab City if they could park on
the streets of Beverly Hills, camp in its parks, attend its schools,
and beg or "work for food" on Rodeo Drive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is why some critics have
called the property tax
"regressive." Balkanization of the property tax gives some
plausibility to the otherwise bizarre claim that switching to a sales
tax is less regressive than sticking with a property tax. Within
each city the property tax is progressive, but when your data meld
cities like poor little Parlier and Lynwood with Beverly Hills you
sometimes find poor people paying more of their income in property
taxes than rich people, and getting less for it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then there are resource tax
enclaves. Hydrocarbons and hardrock
minerals are unevenly distributed, geographically. McLure tells us
that the Siberian oblast of Tyumen, with 2% of Russia's people,
yields 65% of Russia's oil. There are similar regional disparities
worldwide.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rich
farm counties are not,
generally, resource tax-enclaves
(except by comparison with poor farm counties).</span> The "rural"
counties
today with high values per head are resort counties, like Vilas and
Walworth in Wisconsin, with their prized lake frontages; or "exurban"
counties like Napa in California; or Berkshire in Massachusetts. In
California, you might think that fruitful farming counties like
Tulare have a lot more taxable real estate value per head than urban
ones. Such is a durable belief, but it is wrong. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Tulare County reports assessed values per head of $38,100.
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The whole state averages $60,000 per head. </small></li>

</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>You might also think that
  Tulare, being rural, has a lot higher
  fraction of land value in its mix, but again, not so. The <b>Land
  Share of Real Estate Value (LSREV)</b> in Tulare County is 28%,
  compared to a statewide mean of 40%, and 47% in Orange County. Grazing
  and mining counties like Inyo have high values of LSREV, but
  they are a small share of the farm economy. Counties with intensive
  working farms, like those of the San Joaquin Valley, have low values

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The environmental damage from
those attitudes might not be so bad
were it not for leapfrogging, urban disintegration, and floating
value. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leapfrogging is when
developers jump over the next eligible
lands for urban expansion, and build farther out, here and there.
</span>This has been a problem in expanding economies ever since cities
emerged from within their ancient walls and stockades, but <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">in our
times and our country it has gone to unprecedented extremes, with
subsidized superhighways and universal auto ownership and truck
shipping.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alfred
Gobar, savvy real estate
consultant from Placentia, has
recorded the amount of land actually used by city and suburban
dwellers for all purposes. From this, he calculates that the entire
U.S. population could live in the state of Missouri (68,965 square
miles). </span>That would be at a density of 3625 people per square
mile, or
5.67 per acre. That is 7683 square feet per person. On a football
gridiron, this is the area from the goal to the 16-yard line.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">He
is not being stingy with land,
at 3625 persons per square mile.</span>
The population density of Washington, D.C., is 10,000 per square
mile, with a 10-story height limit, with vast areas in parks, wide
baroque avenues and vistas, several campuses, and public buildings
and grounds. This is also the density of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, a
well-preserved upper-income residential suburb of Milwaukee, with
generous beaches and parks, tree-lined streets, detached dwellings,
retailing, and a little industry. San Francisco, renowned for its
liveability, has 15,000 per square mile. More than half the land is
in non-residential uses: vast parks, golf courses, huge
military/naval bases, water surface, industry, a huge regional CBD,
etc., so the actual residential density is over 30,000 per square
mile.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">On
Manhattan's upper East Side they
pile up at over 100,000 per
square mile. </span>They do not crowd like this out of desperation,
either.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You may think of rats in
cages, but some of the world's wealthiest
people pay more than we could dream about to live that way. They'll
pay over a million dollars for less than a little patch of ground:
all they get is a stratum of space about 12 feet high on the
umpteenth floor over a little patch of ground they share with many
others. They could afford to live anywhere: they choose Manhattan,
they actually like it there!</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Take 10,000 per square mile as a
reference figure, because it is
easy to calculate with, and because it works in practice, as noted.
You may observe and experience it. At that density, 250 million
Americans would require 25,000 square miles, the land in a circle
with radius of 89 miles, no more. That gives a notion of how little
land is actually demanded for full urban use. It is 9.4% as big as
Texas, 4.2% as big as Alaska, and 7/10 of 1% of the area of the
United States.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And yet, the urban price influence
of Los Angeles extends over 89
miles east-south-east clear to Temecula and Murrieta and beyond, at
which point, however, it meets demand pushing north from San Diego.
Urban valuation fever thus affects much more land than can ever
actually be developed for urban use. Regardless, most owners come to
imagine they might cash in at a high price, with high zoning, at
their own convenience, with public services supplied by "the public,"
meaning other taxpayers. This is the meaning of "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">floating value</span>."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If their land is downzoned for
farming, open space, or habitat,
they regard it as a "taking," and plead the 14th Amendment. Once we
buy into the Sanctity (Holiness, Sacredness) of private property, we
owe them. If we think of the public's buying large quantities of it
to preserve habitat or open space, the price is already high above
its aggregate value, and the new demand will push the price higher
yet.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a case showing how this
works. The Los Angeles
Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) needed the old Union Station,
northeast of downtown in a run-down neighborhood, as the centerpiece
of its new, integrated mass transit system. With the decline of
interurban passenger rail traffic, the old station was unused. The
owners, mainly Southern Pacific, asked more than MTA offered, so MTA
invoked its power of <span style="font-weight: bold;">eminent domain</span>
and condemned the land. The case
went to judgement, and in 1984 the court awarded SP an amount about
twice the going price for land in the area. <i>The court's reason was
that the coming of mass transit would raise values around the new
central station, and SP should be paid as much as neighboring
landowners would be able to get after the station was built.</i></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus, land originally <i>granted</i>
to SP to help subsidize
mass transit was used instead to obstruct and penalize mass transit.
Private property had become an end in itself, Holy and Sacred, a
welfare entitlement, rather than a means to an end. MTA (the
taxpayers) had to pay a price for land based on the unearned
increment that its own construction and operation was expected to
create in the future.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Later, MTA was to stint on subway
construction, resulting in
subsidence on Hollywood Boulevard, but there was no stinting on
paying off SP for doing nothing: the award came to $84.7 millions.
<b>This is how the 14th Amendment works in practice, making private
property an end, sanctified for its own sake, rather than a means to
a higher end. It makes landowners the spoiled children of the
national family, inflating the cost of every program that entails
acquiring land. It means there is no chance that the public, whether
through government or the Nature Conservancy, can preserve more than
token areas of habitat by buying it: it would bankrupt us.&nbsp; </b>...

<blockquote>
  <p><b>The three sources of land rent, the gift of nature, public services and
        community development, lead logically to the justice of three distinct taxes
        on land.</b> The gift of nature is primarily the agricultural value of land,
        but also the value of natural resources and the extra value of land near
        rivers and harbors that arises because such land represents good places to
        put cities whether or not cities are presently there. This component of the
        rental value of
    land should be collected <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">nationally </span>and used to
    support a guaranteed income for all citizens. The part of land value that arises
    from public services is justly the income of the community that provides those
    services. When private individuals and firms undertake activities that raise
    the rental value of surrounding land, the value thereby created should justly
    be awarded to those whose actions
    create it. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Building investment exhibits
diminishing marginal productivity.
For example, the first $10K spent yields 30%, or $3K; but $1K (10%)
is paid in interest, leaving a $2K surplus. To acquire a superior
location that confers this surplus, the buyer can spend up to $2K
annually, which means paying up to $20K for the land (at 10%, $20K
costs $2K/year). The next $10K spent may yield more than 10% too, say
20%, conferring more surplus and adding more value to the land. The
idea is to invest until the last $10K unit yields 10%, just enough to
pay interest. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To understand
ground rents and land prices is to
understand cities; not to understand is to remain mired forever in
confusion and fallacy. Ground rent continues forever, generally
tending to rise; therefore, to buy title to land, people pay prices
that look high relative to current cash flows.</span> In Riverside, a
low
density city of 208,000, land prices go up to $18/sf. In San
Francisco, with high density and 800,000 people, prices reach
$1,000/sf; in Manhattan they exceed $2,000. In Tokyo, probably the
top of the line, one sale is reported at $25,000/sf. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Urban land
prices take your breath away.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
prices vary extremely from
city to city or block to block.
The cost to build a square foot of floor space is fairly constant
from place to place, but demand varies with location.</span> A small
rise in
floor rental translates into a large rise in ground rent and land
price, because the land owner gets everything above what is required
to operate and amortize the building. Thus, </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small>in Riverside,
neighborhood mall space rental of $12 just pays for the building,
with only a little left over, resulting in land prices of perhaps
$5-$8/sf. 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>In Manhattan, rentals are triple those in
Riverside; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">all
surplus accrues to ground rent, resulting in land prices 300 times
higher than in Riverside.</span></small></li>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At key locations in bigger cities,
land prices are not just high
per square foot, they are higher per capita than in small cities.
They are even higher relative to building values, in spite of the
high-rise buildings. Remember that each additional floor adds more
ground rent, because floor space rental is more than enough to cover
the added cost.&nbsp;<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land prices across cities and
neighborhoods are much more
differentiated than other measures economists commonly cite. For
example, the median income in upper east side Manhattan is about 8
times higher than north of Central Park, while the price of land per
square foot is probably 40 times higher. Urban land is also highly
concentrated in ownership; a handful of people and corporations own
most of it. A growing share of income property is held by wealthy
aliens, who want to diversify and acquire secure wealth they can
manage by remote control. Aliens even hold a good deal of residential
property in international "jet set" communities.<span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a
