  </div>
Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Left_Must.html">What the Left Must
Do: Share the Surplus</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What would you do if you could work two days and take five off? Write?
Play soccer? Tend to the community garden? Time off is an option made
increasingly viable by our relentlessly rising rate of productivity.
French Marxist and media critic Jean Baudrillard, while still advancing
the interests of labor, implores the Left to move on from seeing humans
as workers to seeing workers as human beings, with more needs than
merely the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling people
to live their lives more fully</span> is an issue made to order for
rescuing the Left from the doldrums that descended when &#8220;history ended&#8221;.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What would single mothers do with enough income to stay home?
What
would minorities do with the wherewithal to begin their own businesses?
What would communities do if they did not leak resources up to an upper
class and out to a distant lender or tax collector? What would the
elite do without our commonwealth? The means to these ends is an extra
income apart from labor or capital (savings), that is, a &#8220;social
salary&#8221; from society&#8217;s surplus, a &#8220;Citizens Dividend&#8221; from all the
rents, natural and governmental, that people pay for land and to the
privileged, redirected to everyone equally.&nbsp; Merely demanding a
fair sharing of the bounty from nature and modern society would raise
people&#8217;s self-esteem, a key component for political involvement.
Actually receiving an income supplement would transform our lives and
restructure society.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Unless humanity needs militarism, corporate welfare, and debt
service,
it&#8217;s fair to say most public revenue gets wasted. Demanding a dividend
&#8211; similar to Alaska paying residents a share from oil royalties &#8211;
forces a new dialog on spending priorities. Beyond arguing &#8220;bread not
bombs,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">a dividend replaces
expenditures by politicians (necessarily
influenced by donors) with spending by citizens, the people who
generate the
surplus in the first place. With a dividend, citizens get to see
themselves as direct beneficiaries from reigning in the wild spending
spree</span> on imperial aggression, disloyal
multinationals, and on &#8220;borrowing&#8221; money that never existed until
&#8220;lent&#8221; by the Federal Reserve. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
much
and justifiably criticized corporation is in essence its corporate
charter, given value <span style="font-style: italic;">by limiting the
liability of managers, directors, and investors</span>.</span> It&#8217;s
worth at least the cost of the insurance payments not made by the
corporation, which would equal the costs imposed upon worker, customer,
and nature. As the &#8220;need&#8221; arises, legislatures extend limited liability
even further: Congress legally lowered the greater risk of nuclear
power to benefit Westinghouse, of the Valdez oil transport
spill for Exxon, and the Y2K software design bug for Microsoft. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Politicians
define legally &#8220;safe&#8221; amounts of polluted air and water for GM and
Monsanto, keeping safe the wealth of those responsible. </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Not to be outdone by any legislature,
the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of compensating landowners for
environmental &#8220;takings&#8221;, but has remained silent about landowners
compensating the public for any &#8220;givings&#8221;</span>, as when site values
skyrocket near a new light rail stop. Molly Ivins wrote, </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"Henry George must be in his
grave
spinning' like a cyclotron. We, the people at large, make the land more
desirable; and then the landowners want us to pay them because we won't
allow them to poison the air or to pollute the rivers." (1995 March)<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That&#8217;s how great fortunes are
made: by sloughing off private costs
(which become &#8220;negative externalities&#8221;) while soaking up public
benefits (some &#8220;positive externalities&#8221;). Land titles, corporate
charters, and other privileges &#8211; mere pieces of paper &#8211; are worth
trillions each year. The corporations &#8211; from the Federal Reserve to
Exxon (both founded by the &#8220;oiligarchy&#8221;) &#8211; that receive these
privileges make their owners rich or richer. Their wealth is not
compensation for the exertions of either labor or capital, not profit
in the market from output, but rent from present lobbying of
legislatures or past conquest of others&#8217; lands. Thus laws (&#8220;privilege&#8221;
means &#8220;private law&#8221;) funnel multi-trillions of dollars each year from
the many to the few.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Trillions are enough money that the present beneficiaries spend
fortunes on <span style="font-weight: bold;">electing their water boys</span>
to Congress and state legislatures. Why do public servants agree to let
public assets go for peanuts? Partly out of habit, partly because the
recipients contribute mightily to their political campaigns, but
also.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As taxing land spurs
employment, taxing labor and capital does just the opposite.</span>
Taxing salaries makes it more expensive to hire people. Taxing earned
profits makes it more expensive to invest in firms that hire people. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you want jobs, don&#8217;t tax them. </span>Demanding
jobs while taxing wages is irrational. When we tax (or in other ways
reduce) one&#8217;s efforts, most people naturally produce less.&nbsp; Less
output not only shrinks private assets but also the formation of public
assets downstream.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlike taxing earned incomes,
which
shrinks the pie, collecting rent grows the pie. </span>While taxes on
effort lessen the motivation to produce, charging people rent for
what&#8217;s already been provided, by definition, does not diminish the
motive to produce. Instead, recovering rent removes the private profit
from speculating in land and
resources. And once we redirect revenue from sweetheart deals (e.g.,
Pentagon contracts), tax breaks (e.g., depletion allowances), and
subsidies (e.g., agri-business
support) into a general dividend, then why bother currying favours from
the state? Finding rent-seeking from both nature and the legislature
less profitable, investors would turn to improving production: new
technology and worker re-training, providing society more from
less.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Given the collateral damage by most taxes, the Left must make
clear
that the extra income is to come not from taxes upon people&#8217;s
legitimate earnings but from rent, making it a social salary from
society&#8217;s surplus.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>While
opponents
will cry &#8220;redistribution&#8221;, the Left can point out that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">sharing the
commonwealth is actually &#8220;predistribution.&#8221; Acting like a REIT (Real
Estate Investment Trust) for the public, government would merely
recover and disburse rents before the elite or their friendly
politicians have a chance to misspend society&#8217;s surplus.</span><span

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land titles are the granddaddy of
all privileges. Historically,
titles preceded all others and created a class of elite owners with
the power to win the six other indirect subsidies, along with the
more direct ones &#8211; grants, contracts, and tax favors. To undo
and reverse this history, it's necessary to collect and share the
natural rents from all seven inconspicuous privileges. </small></p>

only eliminate poverty, it'd also erase any rationale for subsidies -

the
free ride of privileges would be like repealing capitalism. Without
those subtle detours imposed upon public revenue, owners would have
to work to amass a fortune, and work is one of the worst ways known
to strike it rich. </small></p>

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 3: The Limits of Government (pages 33-48)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    And it&#8217;s not just regulatory agencies that have been captured. Congress
    itself, which oversees the agencies and writes their controlling laws, has
    been badly infected. According to the Center for Public Integrity, the &#8220;influence
    industry&#8221; in Washington now spends $6 billion a year and employs more
    than thirty-five thousand lobbyists, some two hundred of whom are former
    Congress members who enjoy easy access to their erstwhile colleagues.</p>
  <p>A glimpse at the corporate lobbying game shows just how rewarding it is.
    MBNA, the nation&#8217;s largest credit card bank, spent over $17 million
    on lobbying between 1999 and 2004. This is pin money compared to the sums
    it will reap from an industry-drafted bankruptcy overhaul, passed in 2005,
    which precludes all but the very poor from wiping out their debts and starting
    anew. (The great majority of Americans who file for bankruptcy are middle-class
    victims of job loss, huge medical bills, or family breakup.) A New York Times
    reporter described this scene as the bill was being marked up: &#8220;Lawyers
    and lobbyists jammed Congressional hearing rooms to overflowing. . . . During
    breaks, there was a common, almost comical pattern. The pinstriped lobbyists
    ran into the hallway, grabbed tiny cell phones from their pockets or briefcases,
    and reported back to their clients, almost always with the news they wanted
    to hear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Or consider the biggest influence group in Washington these days, the pharmaceutical
    industry, which boasts more than two lobbyists for every member of Congress. &#8220;You
    can hardly swing a cat by the tail without hitting a pharmaceutical lobbyist,&#8221; says
    Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. And with
    good reason: billions of dollars in drug company profits ride on actions
    taken &#8212; or not taken &#8212; by Congress. In 2003, for example, the
    industry won coverage for prescription drugs under Medicare, while blocking
    the government from negotiating prices downward. It kept Americans from importing
    cheaper medicines from Canada, and protected a system that uses company fees
    to speed the drug approval process.</p>
  <p>Numbers can be put on this sort of thing, and Kevin Phillips, a former Republican
    strategist, has done so. &#8220;The timber industry spent $8 million in campaign
    contributions to preserve a logging road subsidy worth $458 million &#8212; the
    return on their investment was 5,725 percent. Glaxo Wellcome invested $1.2
    million in campaign contributions to get a 19-month patent extension on Zantac
    worth $1 billion &#8212; their net return: 83,333 percent. The tobacco industry
    spent $30 million for a tax break worth $50 billion &#8212; the return on
    their investment: 167,000 percent. For a paltry $5 million in campaign contributions,
    the broadcasting industry was able to secure free digital TV licenses, a
    giveaway of public property worth $70 billion &#8212; that&#8217;s an incredible
    1,400,000 percent return on their investment.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The reason our political system works this way isn&#8217;t that our politicians
    are particularly venal. Rather, the cause is structural. Industries that
    benefit from government favors are wealthy and well-organized. They earn
    high and immediate returns from lobbying expenditures and campaign donations.
    And just because the money isn&#8217;t spent on outright bribes doesn&#8217;t
    mean there aren&#8217;t quid pro quos. Politicians and corporations have
    a symbiotic relationship. Politicians need money and corporations want favors.
    Neither side is dumb or shy. Politicians who hope for long careers won&#8217;t
    often offend money suppliers. At a minimum they&#8217;ll give them access,
    and in politics access is nine-tenths of the battle.</p>
  <p>By contrast, ordinary citizens are cash-poor, unorganized, and ill-informed.
    They amble to the polls a few times per decade, if that. Of all the players
    in politics, they&#8217;re the easiest to fool. And though politicians do
    read opinion polls, these rarely concern the arcane favors corporations seek.
    Hence, disciplined cash-rich corporations easily prevail over ordinary citizens.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s even an economic theory explaining this: Mancur Olson&#8217;s
    logic of collective action. Olson, a Harvard economist, argued that unless
    the number of players in a group is very small, people won&#8217;t combine
    to pursue their common interests. For example, if the CEOs of five major
    airlines decide they want a $500 million government bailout, they pool their
    resources and hire a lobbying firm. Together they tell Congress that without
    the $500 million, their companies won&#8217;t survive, and the consequences
    of their collapse will be dire.</p>
  <p>Who lobbies against them? No one. The reason is that, while the five airlines
    will gain about $100 million each, the average taxpayer will lose only $5
    each. It&#8217;s thus not worth it for ordinary citizens to get off their
    duffs and fight.</p>
  <p>On top of this, there&#8217;s an even deeper problem. Democracy responds
    at best to voters and at worst to money. Both voters and donors are living
    humans. Not even seated at democracy&#8217;s table &#8212; not organized,
    not propertied, and not enfranchised &#8212; are future generations, ecosystems,
    and nonhuman species. James Madison and his brethren could scarcely have
    foreseen this defect. In their day, politics was about the clash between
    living factions, not between living humans and their heirs, or between our
    species and the rest of nature. But that&#8217;s no longer the case.</p>
  <p>The implications of Adam Smith&#8217;s quote at the beginning of this chapter
    are thus even graver than he thought. If government&#8217;s inherent bias
    is toward property owners, the losers aren&#8217;t only the poor. The losers
    are also future generations, ecosystems, and nonhuman species, none of whom
    own any property at all. The only positive news here is that the converse
    might also be true: if future generations, ecosystems, and nonhuman species
    did own property, they might have some economic and political power. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
