Alanna Hartzok: <a href="../docs/Hartzok_ERD_PFboECT.html">Earth
Rights Democracy: Public Finance based on Early Christian Teachings</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Democratic governance has not
yet concerned itself with a "first
principle" question. This question concerns property rights in land -
property rights in the earth itself. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
question is, "Who Should Own the Earth?"</span>
The question of "Who Should Own the Earth?" is a fundamental question.
In venues when this question is asked, the answer is always the same.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The answer is, "everyone should own the
earth and on an equal basis as a birthright."</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>The right to the earth has yet to be pronounced in human rights
covenants. Democracy is unclear, ethically weak, and on shaky ground
when it comes to the question of the right to the land and resources of
the earth. Democracy as presently constituted lacks this most
fundamental and basic human right - the equal right to earth. The right
to the earth is the great undiscovered revolution in both American and
global politics.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Early Christian teachings on
the Land
Problem, however, were clear and precise. The question of "Who Should
Own the Earth?" was unequivocally answered. </span>The land ethic of
the early Christian communities was that of "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">koinonia</span>" meaning essentially that
God was the sole owner of the earth which was given as a gift to all
for the "<span style="font-style: italic;">autarkeia</span>,"
the self-reliant livelihood, of all. In the words of John Chrysostom,
Bishop of Constantinople at the close of the fourth century, "The very
air, earth, matter, are the Creator's; and so are you yourself...; and
all other things also."</small><br>
<br>
<small>When Christianity became the state religion of the Roman empire,
the
early Christian teachings on land were overtaken by the Roman land laws
of "<span style="font-style: italic;">dominium</span>" - a legalization
of property in land originally obtained by conquest and plunder. A
largely corrupted Christianity, uprooted from its early teachings on
land ownership, too often went hand in hand with the exploitation and
degradation of centuries of colonial conquests. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A
statement by the great South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu addressed
this point in a succinct and profound manner. He said, "When the
missionaries came to Africa they had the Bible and we had the land.
They said 'Let us pray.' We closed our eyes. When we opened them we had
the Bible and they had the land."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic;">[10]&nbsp; ... </span></small></span></small></div>
<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Augustine</span>:
He (according to Avila's research) saw that <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the poor are poor because they
have been deprived by the propertied few of the wealth that should
belong to all.</span>
He laid the blame for this unjust situation squarely on the doorstep of
an absolutist and exclusivist legal right of private ownership. He
reminded his audience that they were all "made from one mud" and
sustained "on one earth" under the same natural conditions, having the
same essence and called to the same destiny. He rejected the legalized
status quo as inappropriate for human living. Holding that legal
arrangements of property rights were of human origin, he asserted that
they should be changed, in theory and in practice, in function of a
faith-informed ethic based on the true meaning of ownership.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Basil the Great:</span> He saw
that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a
privileged few were exceedingly rich, ostentatious, and powerful,
inasmuch as wealth, particularly the wealth-producing resource, land,
was concentrated in the hands of the few.</span> He taught a philosophy
of ownership based on the view that God was Father and giver and
Provider for all, and that therefore a few must cease stealing the
food-producing resources that God had destined for the use of all.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Basil admits a certain
right
of laborers to the product of their labor but asks the landlords by
what right they exercise ownership over their vast estates: "Which
things, tell me, are yours? Whence have you brought them into being?"</span>
Whatever you have produced, or brought into being, may justly be yours.
However, it is land that has made the landlords rich, and land is not
something they have brought into being." Speaking to the rich Basil
said:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">You
are like one occupying a place in a theatre, who should prohibit others
from entering, treating that as one's own which was designed for the
common use of all.... If each one would take that which is sufficient
for one's needs, leaving what is in excess to those in distress, no one
would be rich, no one poor. Did you not come naked from the womb? Will
you not return naked into the earth?<small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">[14]</span></small></span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Jesus pointed to Old Testament teachings regarding land ethics.
According to some contemporary theologians, one of the tasks of the
mission of Jesus was to restore the original intent of the Jubilee. In
Luke 4:18 (by way of Isaiah 61:1-3): He has anointed me to preach good
news to the poor.. to proclaim release of captives.. To set at liberty
those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As theologian <span style="font-weight: bold;">Walter Brueggeman</span>
explains in "<span style="font-style: italic;">Land: The Foundation of
Humanness</span>"<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[15]</span></small>,
the "acceptable year" is the year of the Jubilee when the land was to
be returned to the original holders. The "release of captives" is the
release of debt slaves who had lost their land because they could not
pay the mortgage. A crucial aspect of Jesus' mission was the
reassertion of the land rights of the poor and displaced. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enormous sums are currently
accruing
as unearned income to a relatively few individuals, families and
corporations who are holding large amounts of land, very valuable and
well-located land, and natural resources as their own exclusive private
property.</span> These enormous land values and resource rents are also
accruing as unearned income to banks holding mortgages based on
exploitative compound interest rates. It may be of interest to note
that the word "mortgage" means "dead hand." Truly, when one must work
so many years of one's life to pay off a mortgage, one productive hand
is as if dead in terms of producing for oneself, as the labor of that
hand pays the mortgage. For the 33% of citizens (40 million people) in
the United States who are renters, there is not even equity ownership
to look forward to after a life of labor. For the more than three
million homeless people in American and the multi-millions who are
homeless around the world, what <a href="../George_P&P.html">Henry George said
in 1879</a> holds true
today:<br>
<br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our primary social adjustment is
a
denial of justice. In allowing one man to own the land on which and
from which other men must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a
degree which increases as material progress goes on.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[19] </span></small></div>
<br>
<small>Not only is the land ethic of Old and New Testament prophets and
Henry
George virtually the same, the policy approach of "resource rent for
revenue" also known as "land or site value taxation" has its corollary
in the approach called for by the ancient rabbis in their discussions
about the finer and little known details of Jubilee.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Talmudic rabbinical discussions
considered how fairly to partition the land of Canaan among the tribes
under Joshua. </span>Those with poorer land were to be given more
acreage and
those with more fertile land would be given less. As for land
disadvantageously situated, the adjustment was to be made by money;
that is to say, those holding land nearer the city (Jerusalem) should
pay into the common treasury the estimated excess of value pertaining
to it by reason of its superior situation, while those holding land of
less value, by reason of its distance from the city, would receive from
the treasury a money compensation.</span> Upon the more valuable
holdings was to be imposed a tax, or lease fee, the measure of which
was the excess of their respective values over a given standard, and
the fund thus created was to be paid out in due proportions to those
whose holdings were in less favorable locations. In this, then we see
affirmed the doctrine that natural advantages are common property, and
may not be diverted to private gain.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[20] ...</span></small><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It has been said that the only two
certainties in life are death and taxes and that the power to tax is
the power to create or destroy. </span>The story of the birth of Jesus
is on one level the story of a family on a long and onerous journey to
pay taxes imposed by the Romans upon the people of the land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We
urgently need to establish land tenure and tax policies based on the
deepest wisdom of the Judeo-Christian tradition - a truth based on the
perception of the unity of life, that all is created by God, and on the
realization of the brotherhood and sisterhood of the one humanity. The
privilege of holding large amounts of land or highly valuable land as
individual private property needs to be a conditional, not an absolute
right. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For justice to
prevail, the right to exclusive access to land must be granted only
upon payment of full and fairly assessed land value taxes and resource
rents.</span></span><br>
<br>
We have at hand a powerful solution and a way to secure a world of
peace and plenty. We need to constitute democratic governance on the
firm foundation of equal rights to the land and resources of the earth,
an "earth rights democracy" which removes the burden of taxes from the
backs of those who labor and instead directs government to collect the
value of our common wealth for the benefit of all. A morally correct
form of taxation may not lead to everlasting life, but it WILL promote
and sustain the conditions for lives worth living on planet earth.<small>&nbsp;

Joseph Fels -- <a href="../docs/Fels.html">True
Christianity and My Own Religious Beliefs</a>&nbsp; <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I believe it is blasphemous to
assert or insinuate that God has
condemned some of His children to hopeless poverty, and to the Crimea,
want, and misery resulting therefrom, and has, at the same time,
awarded to others lives of ease and luxury, without labor. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that involuntary poverty and involuntary idleness are
unnatural, and are due to the denial by some of the right of others to
use freely the gift of God to all. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Since labor products are needed to sustain life, and since labor
must
be applied to land in order to produce, I believe that every child
comes into life with divine permission to use land without the consent
of any other child of God. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Where men congregate in organized society, land has a value
apart from
the value of things produced by labor; as population and industry
increase, the value of land increases, but the value of labor products
does not. That increase in land value is community-made value. Inasmuch
as your power to labor is a gift of God, all the wealth produced by
your labor is yours, and no man nor collection of men has a right to
take any of it from you. Do you agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe the community-made value of land belongs to the
community,
just as the wealth produced by you belongs to you. Do you agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Therefore, I believe that the fundamental evil, the great
God-denying
crime of society, is the iniquitous system under which men are
permitted to put into their pocket, confiscate, in fact, the
community-made values of land, while organized society confiscates for
public purposes a part of the wealth created by individuals. Do you
agree to that?</small>

Modern-day Feudalism: Land as
God&#8217;s Gift</small></small></small></small></small></small></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Calling
for "a modern equivalent of Jubilee," signers of a proposal
fundamentally to revise the property tax structure petitioned the
endorsement of the 1984 General Conference of the United Methodist
Church. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The proposal, which the
conference did endorse, sought to shift
taxes from labor to land values. Combining good biblical theology with
public policy insight, the plan offers a simple but critical tax change
as a way of dealing with "poverty, joblessness, slums, urban decay,
farmland destruction, the erosion of public services and facilities and
social justice."</span></small></font></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>The current
property tax combines land and building
taxes; recently, it has become a tax mostly on buildings. As a result,
owner-made building improvements are overtaxed, while land is
under-taxed. And <span style="font-weight: bold;">undertaxing land
encourages its disuse</span>. The Methodist
petitioners&#8217; simple proposal was to tax land, not buildings. The
possibilities are great for achieving social justice through this
easily implemented change in the property tax.<strong> ...</strong></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Biblical justice in this instance, as
Walter
Brueggemann asserts, "is to sort out what belongs to whom, and return
it to them." ...
</span></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>The
generally held belief that ours is a nation of small landholders is a
myth. According to Gene Wunderlich, quoted in a 1979 <i>Harper&#8217;s </i>article,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
"about 3 percent of the population owns 55 percent of all American
land." And that same 3 per cent holds "95 percent of the private land."</span>
Furthermore, while 64 per cent of families own or are in the process of
buying their residences, the residential sector occupies only 2 per
cent of the 1.3 billion acres of privately held land.
</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Feudalism,
it seems, is still with us; its new face
is the landlordism that lets a few benefit from what belongs to
society. This lopsided arrangement denies the Bible&#8217;s insistence that
an equitable share of the Lord&#8217;s resources is the birthright of all
humans. While the U.S. is infinitely better off than the countries of
Latin America, Asia and Africa, our situation is worsening. Consider
these facts:
</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8226; Poor people pay inordinate rents. </span>While
in 1970,
25 per cent of income generally went for rent, today, according to
National Low-Income Housing Coalition reports, that percentage for many
renters, especially the poor, has doubled.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Early in
the century, poor immigrants in New York
City could buy or lease a shop with a fair chance of prospering. Now
many minorities face site costs that almost doom new businesses from
the start. A front foot costs more than the whole lot would have 70
years ago, a startling change even when considering inflation.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>&#8226;Large
firms are deserting the cities for cheaper suburban sites, taking with
them employment and badly needed tax revenues.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8226;Large agribusinesses represent only 13 per
cent of
U.S. farms but take in 72 per cent of agricultural sales</span>,
according to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Economic Research Service. At the
other end of the scale, 50 per cent of the farms account for only 3 per
cent of sales.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8226; Land-holding is gaining ascendancy over
land-using.</span> Land speculation -- holding land for its future
worth
rather than putting it into current production -- has become standard
practice for the affluent.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What gives value to land.</span> </i>Any
real estate textbook will explain that the three factors for
determining land value are "location, location and location." And any
property owner will affirm this truth. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But
what generates locational
value? Three phenomena: God, people and public activities.</span></small></font></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small>God the creator, Genesis tells us,
"looked at
everything he had made, and he found it very good." We recognize this
goodness in the fertility of the soil, natural harbors, scenic beauty,
the availability of water, and the subsurface riches of coal, oil,
gold, iron and other substances. The land has a God-given goodness and
is one of the gifts through which God sustains us.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small>People create land values simply
because they are
social beings, consumers and producers. The more people concentrated on
a piece of land, the higher its value. The press of population
intensifies the demand for homes, jobs and services; this is what makes
Manhattan far more valuable than downtown Richmond, Virginia, and
Richmond more valuable than Anderson, Indiana, and Anderson more
valuable than an uninhabited Utah crossroad.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small>Finally, the public or government
generates land
values by providing streets, schools, police protection and other
infrastructures. Opening a subway system for the District of Columbia
in 1976 gave Washington&#8217;s blighted downtown a new lease on life. The
subway and its riders are stimulating the economy along all of its
corridors. According to a 1981 congressional study, "a minimum of $2
billion in land values has already been added to the existing land
value base." However, it concluded that "only a trickle" of these new
values finds its way back to local government through the property tax.
The biggest share goes to people "lucky enough to own land within easy
access of Metro stations." </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><i
 style="font-weight: bold;">Private vs. common property. ... </i></small></font><font
 size="+0"><small>"<a href="../docs/Andelson_TEITL.html">The earth is
the Lord&#8217;s and the fullness
thereof</a>" (Ps. 24:1). <strong>... </strong></small></font></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>This idea
of the land belonging to all humanity, to
the community as a whole, is not entirely inoperative today. National
parks, school grounds, public building sites, many wilderness areas,
lakes and ocean fronts are recognized as the common property of all.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The immorality of landlordism.</span> </i>An
increasingly small elite is taking possession of the nation&#8217;s land,
enabling them to squeeze more and more from the landless. This is
runaway landlordism, and current public policy fuels its progress.</small></font></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>On the
federal level, while the wages of ordinary
workers find no shelter from the Internal Revenue Service, exemptions
and special preferences for landowners whittle down their taxes or turn
real estate losses into profits. The 1986 Tax Reform Act aims to reduce
these privileges, but landowners&#8217; past ingenuity in avoiding taxation
warrants continued vigilance over tax structures. At the local level,
the property tax rises for owners who build or improve their homes,
rental apartments or commercial buildings, while it is reduced for
those who let their land go fallow. Compare the following situation of
the Joneses, the Smiths and the Greens.</small></font></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Joneses have a well-maintained home. </span>The local
tax office, seeing that they have has added air conditioning, a
recreation room and a new roof, raises their assessment. Never mind
that the Joneses improved their neighborhood and generated jobs and
business. The result will be higher taxes not only this year, but as
long as they keep the house in good condition.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Smiths&#8217; home of the same size and age is an
eyesore. </span>The yard is full of junk, gutters are rusted, screens
are
torn, paint is peeling. The tax office says it is worth less than last
year. The Smiths&#8217; taxes are reduced, a "reward" for blighting the

joblessness and homelessness have been
central concerns of religious social-action groups. There is a growing
awareness that neither private nor public charity is sufficient in
dealing with these problems. Shifting property taxes offers an
effective way to encourage public policy to be responsive to blighted
cities, farm dislocation, declining industries, chronic unemployment
and growing poverty. The need to infuse biblical principles into
solutions for these problems seems imperative. Acknowledgment of this
necessity is already evident in the Catholic bishops&#8217; pastoral letter
on the economy and parallel works by the Presbyterians, United
Methodists and the United Church of Christ. The need to address
poverty&#8217;s basic causes, including the unhealthy concentration of
America&#8217;s land and resources in the hands of so few owners -- who have
tended to misappropriate land values -- ought to be high on our
religious and public policy agendas.</small></font></small></p>

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html">The
Political Economy of the Gospels</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>The message of the Gospels is that our sins are forgivable,
that
death is not to be feared because our true lives are spiritual rather
than physical, and that participation in the kingdom of God -- a new
and better life in this world as well as the next -- is accessible to
all who orient themselves to God.</small></p>
<p><small>Drawing on the Old Testament, Jesus taught that our first
commandment is that we love God with all our heart, and all our soul,
and all our mind, and all our strength, and that our second
commandment is that we love our neighbor as
ourselves.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>1</i></b></small></font> When
asked who our
neighbor is, he replied with the parable of the good Samaritan,
implying that anyone we encounter is our neighbor.
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font> Jesus taught an
ethic in which
there are no bounds on our obligations to others:&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... 
</span></span></small></p>
<p><small>When asked by Peter, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
against
me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" Jesus replied, "I say not
unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."&nbsp; In
other words, we are to
forgive indefinitely.</small></p>
<p><small>This unbounded obligation to others is reconciled with the
need to
survive through the introduction of the idea that it is not through
our own anxious efforts, but through God's provision for us that we
survive:<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<p><small>The message of the Gospels denies the validity of concern for
material scarcity. This is made particularly clear in the accounts of
the feeding of the multitudes with just a few loaves and
fishes.</small></p>
<p><small>comprehending this counterintuitive idea, that material
scarcity
is not to concern us, is brought out by the accounts of how even
Jesus' disciples did not understand the message:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... 
</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p><small>Without a concept of material scarcity it is difficult to
construct an economic theory, as material scarcity is central to
economic theory. And yet, even without a concept of material scarcity
there is an allocation problem to be solved--the allocation of our
efforts.</small></p>
<p><small>In the parable of the talents we are told that we will be
expected
to accomplish something with the resources that are put into our
hands. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>8</i></b></small></font> This
parable is
followed in Matthew by a teaching that may be taken as an indication
of what constitutes accomplishment:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... </i></b></small></font></small><small></small></p>
<p><small>In other words, every person is a manifestation of God, and
anything that we can do to help anyone is to our credit.</small></p>
<small>There is thus an unlimited task for each of us. No one of us
will
ever be able to say, "I have done every last thing that might be
required of me. I have no further obligations." But neither are we to
be concerned that that which we have left undone might be held
against us. For if we refrain from judging others, we ourselves will
not be judged:&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong><br>
</small>
<p><small>With this message of the Gospels in mind, turn now to the
problem
of political economy, the problem of what principles ought to govern
the organization of the production of goods and their
distribution.</small></p>
<p><small>One might first ask whether the requirement that we abandon
concern for scarcity would preclude production. The answer is no, it
is not production that we are cautioned to avoid, but anxiety. There
are any number of reasons why we might allocate some of our time to
production, without being anxious about our own material
requirements. We feel called to undertake a particular kind of work,
so we do it, trusting that any material needs we may have will be
satisfied. If we want to undertake our productive activities in
conjunction with others, that's fine, too. Associating with others
provides us with opportunities to be useful to them.</small></p>
<p><small>Among those who are close to us there is no need for prices
and
markets, because we can see easily enough how we can be of service to
them. But human discernment is limited, and prices and markets help
us to be aware of what is valued by people who are less close to
us.<strong> ... </strong></small><small></small></p>
<p><small>Refraining from the use of force is a recurring theme in the
political economy of the Gospels. We are called to refrain from the
use of force in defense of property. We are called to refrain from
the use of force in financing public activities. We are called to
refrain from the use of force in providing for those who might
otherwise lack. And we show our love for those who do not wish to
participate in our political economy by leaving for them the same per
capita value of land and natural resources that we claim for
ourselves.</small></p>
<p><small>Consider now how this framework bears on some traditional
questions of economic ethics. Take first the problem of the just
price. This simply is not an issue. If two people have the
opportunity to trade--to cooperate--on terms that are mutually
agreeable to the two of them, it is not for us to say that they ought
to be trading on other terms. Between people who love one another,
the problem of settling on the terms of trade is no more difficult
than the problem when friends eat lunch together of deciding who will
pick up the tab, or how it will be split.</small></p>
<small>That those outside a relationship are not called upon to
prescribe
its terms is supported by a passage from
Luke: <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
Relations between employers and employees are a special case of
relations between traders.<strong> ... </strong><br>
The problem of worker management is not a problem either. <strong>... </strong><br>
</small>
<p><small>Corporate responsibility may be more of an issue for a
Gospel-based political economy. The corporate form of organization
permits us to participate in the establishment and management of
firms while knowing very little about the other people with whom we
are involved or the actions that are taken on our behalf. If this
leads us to support implicitly actions of managers in their concern
for the bottom line that we could not in good conscience take
ourselves, then there is something troubling about our participation
in corporations. We need to find ways of managing the resources under
our control that do not lead us to endorse implicitly and to profit
from actions that we would not endorse directly or take ourselves.
</small></p>
<p><small>The grand question of economic ethics, the question of
whether
capitalism or socialism is the more appropriate form of political
economy, is another non-question from the perspective of the Gospels.
Everyone who wants to live under socialism should be free to live
under socialism, and everyone who wants to live under capitalism
should be free to live under capitalism. In whichever group we fall,
we will want to insure that those who want to organize their lives by
different principles of political economy have their share of land
and natural resources with which to do so.</small></p>
<p><small>A political economy based on the Gospels is a political
economy
based on love. As the First Epistle of John says, "There is no fear
in love; but perfect love casteth out
fear."<font size="-1"><small><b><i>17</i></b></small></font> To
construct a
political economy of the Gospels we must be free of fear: free of
fear that others may rob us; free of fear that others may not
contribute to the provision of public goods or to provision for those
who might otherwise lack; free of fear that our incomes will be too
low or the prices we face too high; free of fear that if we don't do
something, someone will be exploited. Only when love has replaced all
fear in our hearts will we be able to construct the political economy
of the Gospels.</small><a href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html"> <small><span

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SEP.html"><small><small>How Sharing Earth Brought Peace</small></small></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since forever, humans have
claimed and counter-claimed every
square inch of this planet. Occasionally, these disputes have ended
peacefully. What has worked in other times and places might work
again in the Mideast. Delivering a double dividend, what settled land
disputes also developed moribund economies and revived developed
ones. Among others, New York, now aiming to rebuild, has used this
policy before. Because it's growing popular among environmentalists,
greens could lead the US to geonomics.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...&nbsp; </span>These
cases involved different classes, not different cultures.
Yet with a new twist the rent rebate that worked within society may
work between societies. The Koran urges landlords to not gouge
tenants but to consider land a trust. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">In Israel, admonished to not
own land forever, since the land is Mine (Leviticus), the National
Trust leases all the land to the occupants. These strictures could
lead to geonomics.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Israel
and Palestine would establish a steward to collect land
dues and disburse rent dividends a la Alaska's oil dividend. </span>Since
land is more valuable in Israel than in Palestine, Jews would pay in
more than Arabs, yet everyone would get back the same. And since
Israelis prosper, they drive up land values; having Jews as co-owners
developing land, raising its value, fattening everyone's Citizens
Dividend Arabs might accept that. Profit does make for strange
bedfellows. Two archrivals, China and Taiwan, recently agreed to
explore for oil together. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">While sharing rent may soothe hurt
feelings, collecting it
stimulates development.</span>&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using geonomics,
people have turned some of the poorest lands into
the richest economies. Hong Kong is a barren rock owned by the
public. The city collects enough site-rent to keep taxes on effort
way down.&nbsp; </span>... </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Where to draw a line in the sand
becomes a lot less contentious
when land and oil are no longer spoils of war and when neighbors do
not endure drastically different standards of living. Growing up, we
learn to not fight over toys but to take turns. Societies need to
learn this, too. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Early last century, Gifford
Pinchot, first head of the US Forest
Service, said: "The earth belongs of right to all its people and not
to a minority, insignificant in numbers but tremendous in wealth and
power. The people shall get their fair share of the benefit which
comes from the development of the country which belongs to us all
with equal opportunity for all and special privileges for none." A
man in a Republican administration could say that then. We need to
hear it again now. &nbsp; <a
