<blockquote>
  <p> When land rent goes into private pockets, neither labor nor capital
    get their fair returns (wages and interest).&nbsp; The true entrepreneur (as
    opposed to the one whose business is mostly collecting land rent) makes out
    just as badly as the individual who supplies his labor to that entrepreneur.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile,
    the land speculator, the private rent collector hides behind the widow's skirts.&nbsp; Business
    plans are never executed, or businesses fail, and a new category of people
    comes to prominence: the working poor.&nbsp; Where land is available, there
    is little poverty.&nbsp; Where land's price is high, many more people lack
    sufficient income to provide for their own and their families' needs.&nbsp; Consider
    this fact as you think of both American poverty and global poverty. </p>
  <p>When people must &quot;invest&quot; large amounts in money in land (whether to rent
    it from a landlord or to buy it from a seller), they have little left
    for machinery or equipment (capital) or employees (wages) &#8212; or, as
    homeowners, to build a house and furnish it. Buying land doesn't create jobs
    for anyone except perhaps real estate brokers and mortgage lenders. Buying
    machinery and household goods creates jobs. Building homes creates jobs.</p>

<p>H.G Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/08_Why_LVT_Better.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>,
    Chapter 8: Why a Land-Value Tax is Better than an Equal Tax on All Property</a> (in
    the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Book
    VIII: Application of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3: The proposition tried
    by the canons of taxation</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly
      insisted upon is that it is equally protected by the state. The basis of
    this idea is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible by
    the state &#8212; that
      there is a value created and maintained by the community, which is justly
    called upon to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true?
    Only of
      the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
    is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of the community.
      It exists only as the community exists. Scatter again the largest community,
      and land, now so valuable, would have no value at all. With every increase
      of population the value of land rises; with every decrease it falls. This
    is
      true of nothing else save of things which, like the ownership of land,
    are in their nature monopolies.</p>
  <p>The tax upon land values is, therefore, the most just and equal of all taxes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable
          benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive.</li>
    <li> It is the taking by the community, for the use of the community, of
      that value which is the creation of the community.</li>
    <li> It is the application of the common property to common uses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will
      the equality ordained by Nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage
      over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence;
      and each will obtain what he fairly earns. <strong>Then, but not till then,
      will labor get its full reward, and capital its natural return. </strong>... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/08_Why_LVT_Better.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<p>    The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
  (Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back
  to the Land</a> (1881)&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Both
capitalists and operatives, therefore, are intensely
disappointed and supremely dissatisfied with these disheartening
results, and mutually reproach each other with fraud and foul dealing
in the division of their common earnings. </span>Their mutual
misunderstandings and rival claims to a larger share than they
actually receive have given rise to "lockouts" on the one side and
"strikes" on the other; to combinations of capitalists among the
employers and "Trade Unions" among the labourers. Thus their mutual
relations, which ought to be of the friendliest character, have at
last settled down into the permanent form of an insane internecine
war, which inflicts irreparable injury on the common interests of
both.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
never occurs to either side that a third party could possibly
be liable to blame.</span> I think I have shown that neither party has
received, or at all events can retain for his own use and enjoyment,
its fair share of their common earnings. The existing system of Land
Tenure, like a great national thief, robs both parties of an enormous
amount of their earnings for the benefit of a class who do not labour
at all.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As the operatives complain the
louder, so the case they make
against the capitalists seem really the weaker and the worse founded
of the two. Mr. Cairnes, with many others, proved to evidence that
unless in rare and exceptional cases it is perfectly impossible for
the capitalist to withhold from the operatives their fair share in
their common earnings.&nbsp; <a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/debate_hyndman_1889.html">The Great
Debate: Single Tax vs Social Democracy</a>&nbsp; (1889)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is in capital no power to
oppress labour;
capital is not the employer of labour; labour is the employer of
capital. (Applause.) That is the natural order; labour came before
capital could be; it is labour produces capital; there is no particle
of capital that can properly be styled capital that labour has not
been exerted to produce. (Hear, hear.) Give labour land; let it get
it on equal terms; secure to the labourer the reward of his
exertions, and the distinction between the labourer and the
capitalist will pass away. With the increase in the wages of labour
if there be great organizations of capital they must necessarily be
co-operative organizations in which labour shall have its full share
and its full right. (Applause.) ...&nbsp; <a

"A. J. O."&nbsp; (probably Mark Twain)&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/ajo_slavery.html">Slavery</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <b>I am capital and I
employ people!</b>
</small><br>
<small>But I gain in other ways besides pecuniary benefit. I have lost
the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
benevolence. I am a "large employer of labour," to whom the whole
country, and the labourer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
say, "See the power of capital! These poor labourers, having no
capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
country, and his own fortune together."</small><br>
<br>
<small>Whereas it is not my capital that does any of these things. It
is
not my capital but the labourer&#8217;s toil that builds up my fortune
and the wealth of the country. It is not my employment that keeps him
from pauperism, but my monopoly of the land forcing him into my
employment that keeps him on the brink of it. It is not want of
capital that keeps the labourer from using the land, but my refusing
him the use of the land that prevents him from acquiring capital. All
the capital he wants to begin with is an axe and a spade, which a
week&#8217;s earnings would buy him, and for his maintenance during
the first year, and at any subsequent time, he could work for me or
for others, turnabout, with his work on his own land. Henceforth with
every year his capital would grow of itself, and his independence
with it, and that this is no fancy sketch, anyone can see for himself
by taking a trip into the country, where he will find well-to-do
farmers who began with nothing but a spade and an axe (so to speak)
and worked their way up in the manner described.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a
