<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">The Power of
Neo-classical Economics </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Having taken shape in the 1880-1890s, <b>Neo-Classical Economics (henceforth
        NCE)</b> remained remarkably static. Major texts by Marshall, Seligman,
        and Richard T. Ely, written in the 1890s, went through many reprintings
        each
        over a period of 40 years with few if
    any changes. "It was for the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle (1884)
    that I wrote the first edition of my <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Outlines</span>, under
    the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Introduction to Political
    Economy</span>. In this first edition of
    the <span style="font-style: italic;">Outlines </span>there is to be found
    the general philosophy and principles that have shaped all future editions,
    including
    that of
    1937" (Ely, 1938, p.81).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small></p>
  <p>Not until 1936 was there another major "revolution," and that was hived off
      into a separate compartment, macro-economics, and contained there so as not
      to disturb basic tenets of NCE. Compartmentalization, we will see in several
      instances, is the common NCE defense against discordant data and reasoning.
      After that came another 40 years of Samuelson's "neoclassical synthesis." J.B.
      Clark's treatment of rent, dating originally from his obvious efforts to refute
      Henry George (see below), "has been followed by an admiring Paul Samuelson
      in all of the many editions of his Economics" (Dewey, p.430). ...</p>
  <p>The present paper purports to identify the elements of <b>Neo-Classical Economics
        (NCE)</b> that were planted there to sap and confound George, and show how
        they continue to warp, debase and vitiate much of the discipline called economics.
        Once a paradigm is well-ensconced it becomes a power in itself, a set of
        reflexes to sort the true and false. Any exception spoils the web of interpretation
        through which art seeks to make human experience intelligible. Only the young,
        the brave, the energetic, the sincere and the skeptical can break off such
        fetters. This work is addressed
    and dedicated to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>I. The Imperative to Put
        Down Henry George<br>
  </b><b>&nbsp;I-A. The crabbed
        spirit of neo-classical economics</b></p>
  <p>Neo-classical economics makes an ideal of "choice." That sounds good, and
      liberating, and positive. In practice, however, it has become a new dismal
      science, a science of choice where most of the choices are bad. "TANSTAAFL" (There
      Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch) is the slogan and shibboleth. Whatever
      you want, you must give up something good. As an overtone there is even
      a hint that what one person gains he must take from another. The theory
      of gains from
      trade has it otherwise, but that is a heritage from the older classical
      economists. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Henry George, in contrast, had a genius for reconciling-by-synthesizing. Reconciling
      is far better than merely compromising. He had a way of taking two problems
      and composing them into one solution, as we lay out in detail infra. He took
      two polar philosophies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collectivism </span>and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">individualism</span>,
      and synthesized a plan to combine the better features, and discard the worse
      features, of each. He was a problem-solver, who did not suffer incapacitating
      dilemmas and standoffs.</p>
  <p>As policy-makers, neo-classical economists present us with "choices" that
      are too often hard dilemmas. They are in the tradition of Parson Malthus, who
      preached to the poor that they must choose between sex or food. That was getting
      right down to grim basics, and is the origin of a well-earned epithet, "the
      dismal science." Most modern neo-classicals are more subtle (although the
      fascist wing of the otherwise admirable ecology movement gets progressively
      less so).
      Here are some dismal dilemmas that neo-classicals pose for us today.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For efficiency we must sacrifice equity; </li>
    <li>to attract business we must lower taxes so much as to shut the libraries
          and starve the schools;</li>
    <li>to prevent inflation we must keep an army of unfortunates unemployed; </li>
    <li>to make jobs we must chew up land and pollute the world; </li>
    <li>to motivate workers we must have unequal wealth; </li>
    <li>to raise productivity we must fire people; and so on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The neo-classical approach is the "trade-off." A trade-off is a compromise.
      That has a ring of reasonableness to it, but it presumes a zero-sum condition.
      At the level of public policy, such "trade-offs" turn into paralyzing stand-offs,
      where no one gets nearly what he wants, or could get. It overlooks the
      possibility of a <span style="font-style: italic;">reconciliation</span>, or synthesis,
      instead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In such a resolution, we are not
      limited by trade-offs between fixed A and B: we get more of both.</span> ...

    sustain the idea. But the principles are scattered throughout the literature.
    The literature is compartmentalized in such a fashion that prevents students

    they wrote, to focus taxation on land.&nbsp; <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/About_HG.html">Henry
    George</a>, after all, was nearly elected Mayor of New York City in 1886
    and 1897.&nbsp; Frank Knight, founder of The Chicago School, followed them

    obvious to readers who have been spared the formal conditioning imposed on

  distinctive attributes.&nbsp; A number of economists don't buy it, but don't
  do anything about it - acquiescing in error by silence, indifference, passivity,
  or anxiety of the professional consequences.&nbsp; They handle the question

  <small>The market exchange of capital for land causes an elementary failure
  in the minds of many.&nbsp; Land and capital each have their prices and may
  be bought and sold for money.&nbsp; Each alike is part of an individual's assets,
  colloquially called his "capital".&nbsp; Each is a store of value to the individual.&nbsp; What

  Geology, Geometry, Surveying, Astronomy, Theology, Ecology, Oceanography, Meteorology,

  and Nature and Creation as definable topics distinct from man's works. ... <br>

  two points are allowed (short run and long).&nbsp; Thus micro theory can ignore
  the birth of capital, its growth, maturity, senescence, death, burial, and
  replacement, vital elements of its difference from land.&nbsp; Time, and relations
  of sequence,&nbsp;are hived off to the far satellite of "finance," usually
  not even taught in departments of economics.&nbsp; Time is also referred to
  under "history of economic thought," as an obsession of some 19th century Austrians

  which is the enduring core of the discipline.&nbsp; Microtheory still deals
  with relations of coexistence in time, and space as well. As A. A. Milne once
  wrote, "It isn't really anywhere, it's somewhere else instead." Of neoclassical
  theory we may add, "It isn't really anytime, it's some other time instead."<small><span

  within elaborate mazes behind ever thicker walls of new argot.&nbsp; Jesuits
  quibbling with Jansenists in 18th Century France were never more arcane nor
  tiresome than most economic theorists today.&nbsp; These elaborate structures

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The Compatibility of
    Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics </a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As with all nineteenth century moral philosophers,
    Henry George subscribed to a belief in natural law. The natural order of
    things as he saw it required that land be held in usufruct and that rent
    from such should be returned to society. The theory was inspired by his deeply
    religious roots and grounded in his reading of the prominent thinkers that
    predated him. The natural order was also a moral order, and the failure to
    comply with the order of nature and society as he saw it was a perversion
    of justice. The fruits of the land belonged to everyone, just as the fruits
    of one&#8217;s own labor were uniquely one&#8217;s own. Since one owned one&#8217;s
    body, one was entitled to keep the product of one&#8217;s physical efforts.
    Society had no more right to confiscate the earnings of one&#8217;s sweat
    and brow than it ought to leave in the hands of rich landowners the rent
    that was everyone&#8217;s inherent birthright to be shared. There were just
    and unjust taxes, and the only just tax was that which grew out of rent,
    of the unearned increment that visited certain land sites as windfall gains
    because of the efforts and investments by the community. Income and excise
    taxes were unjust and confiscatory&#8212; even theft, as especially were
    tariffs. Taxing or collecting land rent alone was the means of ending poverty
    and restoring progress. Indeed many Georgists reject use of the word tax
    entirely, preferring instead to talk instead about rent collection. There
    is even a lapel button Georgists use that says &#8220;Abolish all taxes;
    collect ground rent instead.&#8221;</small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Georgist Economics: Moral Premises</span></small><br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>What distinguished Henry George&#8217;s
  views from those of his adversaries in the last decade of his life was his
  assertion that economics was necessarily a moral science. Unlike those who
  became the founders of the American Economics Association in 1885, most of
  whom were transitional figures to what would become neoclassical economics,
  the primary focus of George and his disciplines was economic justice. This
  is not to say that explanation was cast aside; indeed the subtitle of his magnum
  opus, <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span>,
  was <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">An Inquiry into the
  Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth
  . . . The Remedy</span>. Why, he asked, in the midst of such boundless plenty
  is there such abject poverty? He would dedicate his book, first published in
  1879, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;to those who, seeing the vice and
  misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and privilege, feel
  the possibility of a higher social state and would strive for its attainment.&#8221;</span> He
  had known poverty first hand when he was struggling to support his young family
  and establish himself as a printer, a journalist and a publisher. He could
  also see before him the fruits of land and nature easily available to be harvested
  but for its legal capture by monopoly titleholders. He wrote of all this in
  some six books and countless other essays, the focus always on the theme of
  economic justice. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is far easier to outline the basic premises
    of Georgist economics than it is to do so for the emerging field of ecological
    economics. Georgism is a tradition that grew out of a clearly formed tradition
    of 19th century classical economics and has been refined further for the
    past century. It was neoclassical economics that diverged from the reigning
    orthodoxy. The differences between the classical tradition as represented
    and defended by Henry George and the emerging neoclassical school were vividly
    portrayed from their earliest divergence, even to the staging of formal debates
    between George and the new orthodoxy&#8217;s adherents. <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">75</span> In
    contrast, ecological economics along with other emerging heterodox schools
    is itself very much a reaction to the neoclassical tradition&#8217;s insensitivities
    and failures. The differences between ecological economics and the floundering
    discipline of neoclassical economics are as much by way of the former&#8217;s
    criticism of the latter as they are an enunciation of clear starting points.</small><br>
  <br>
  To be sure, neoclassical economics emerged gradually over a period of some
  fifty years, and only reached its heyday, one might argue, with the arrival
  of Paul Samuelson. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Samuelson, the MIT economist
  whose text has gone through some 16 editions and has outsold all other text
  combined once said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care who writes a nation&#8217;s laws
  . . . if I can write its economics textbooks.&#8221; </span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">76</span> The neoclassical position
  developed ever greater abstract mathematical applications, with models ever
  more detached from &#8220;real world&#8221; market forces. This system of analysis
  now has reached a point of questionable utility due to its hermetic and Newtonian
  emulations.</small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">77 </span>Little by little, one
  premise and formula after another have been cast aside, to a point now that
  there is a broad recognition among economic theorists at least that the discipline
  faces an intellectual crisis.</small><small><span

    <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>Without
    enumerating further criticisms that have been levied against neoclassical
    economic thinking, something that has been done far better elsewhere than
    is possible here, suffice it to say that some of the most compelling charges
    have been made by the ecological economists.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">79</span></small> The
    most trenchant one as explicated by economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen is
    its violation of the basic laws of physics.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">80 </span></small>It assumes
    a continuing draw-down of the earth&#8217;s store of energy, of which there
    is, of course, only a finite amount. If the economy continues to expand to
    include all elements of the earth, it will consume so many resources, particularly
    energy resources, that ultimately life itself is destroyed. One study calculated
    that if everyone in the world lived at the level of the average American,
    three &#8220;earths&#8221; would be necessary to accommodate us all. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">81</span></small> The challenge,
    argue the ecological economists, is to structure economic analysis and the
    economy itself in such a way that markets are contained and that existence
    outside economic reach is respected and preserved. Whereas other studies
    of the environment within the framework of conventional neoclassical economics
    attempt to price nature in a way that its value is assured, ecological economists
    work from the conviction that such an approach is questionable if not futile,
    as it can never achieve any accurate and reliable market values for such
    existence.<small><span
