      of course, have to pay me rent.</span> They could not reasonably expect
      me
      to allow them the use of the land for nothing. I am not a hard man,
      and in fixing the rent I would be very liberal with them. I would
      allow them, in fact, to fix it themselves. What could be fairer? Here
      is a piece of land, let us say, it might be a farm, it might be a
      building site, or it might be something else - if there was only one
      man who wanted it, of course he would not offer me much, but if the
      land be really worth anything such a circumstance is not likely to
      happen. On the contrary, there would be a number who would want it,
      and they would go on bidding and bidding one against the other, in
      order to get it. I should accept the highest offer - what could be
      fairer? Every increase of population, extension of trade, every
      advance in the arts and sciences would, as we all know, increase the
      value of land, and the competition that would naturally arise would
      continue to force rents upward, so much so, that in many cases the
    tenants would have little or nothing left for themselves. </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
      this case a number of those who were hard pushed would seek to
      borrow</span>, and as for those who were not so hard pushed, they
      would, as
      a matter of course, get the idea into their heads that if they only
      had more capital they could extend their operations, and thereby make
      their business more profitable. Here I am again. The very man they
      stand in need of; a regular benefactor of my species, and always
      ready to oblige them. With such an enormous rent-roll I could furnish
      them with funds up to the full extent of the available security; they
      would not expect me to do more, and in the matter of interest I would
    be equally generous. </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I would allow them to fix the rate
      of it themselves in precisely
      the same manner as they had fixed the rent. I should then have them
      by the wool, and if they failed in their payments it would be the
      easiest thing in the world to sell them out. They might bewail their
      lot, but business is business. They should have worked harder and
      been more provident. Whatever inconvenience they might suffer, it
      would be their concern, and not mine. What a glorious time I would
      have of it! Rent and interest, interest and rent, and no limit to
      either, excepting the ability of the workers to pay. Rents would go
      up and up, and they would continue to pledge and mortgage, and as
      they went bung, bung, one after another, it would be the finest sport
      ever seen. thus, from the simple leverage of land monopoly, not only
      the great globe itself, but everything on the face of it would
      eventually belong to me. I would be king and lord of all, and the
    rest of mankind would be my most willing slaves. </small></p>

      it would not be consistent with my

        of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
        Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
        of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your
        meaning, if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But
        reading it as a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private
        property in land shall be understood when you speak merely of private
        property. With this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge
        for private property in land are eight. Let us consider them in order
        of presentation. You urge:</p>
      <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.
        (RN, paragraph 5) ...<br>
        2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
        (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
        3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land.
        (RN, paragraph 8.) ...<br>
        4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself.
        (RN, paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
        5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
        of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is
        sanctioned by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
        6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
        in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.)
        ...<br>
        7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases
        wealth, and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph
        51.) ...<br>
        8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature,
        not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to
        take the value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel
        to the private owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
      <p><strong>8. That the right to possess private property in land is from
          nature, not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and
          that to
        take the value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel
        to the private owner.</strong> (51.)</p>
      <p>This, like much else that your Holiness says, is masked in the use of
        the indefinite terms &#8220;private property&#8221; and &#8220;private
        owner&#8221; &#8212; a want of precision in the use of words that has
        doubtless aided in the confusion of your own thought. But the context
        leaves no doubt that by private property you mean private property in
        land, and by private owner, the private owner of land.</p>
      <p>The contention, thus made, that private property in land is from nature,
        not from man, has no other basis than the confounding of ownership with
        possession and the ascription to property in land of what belongs to
        its contradictory, property in the proceeds of labor. You do not attempt
        to show for it any other basis, nor has any one else ever attempted to
        do so. That private property in the products of labor is from nature
        is clear, for nature gives such things to labor and to labor alone. Of
        every article of this kind, we know that it came into being as nature&#8217;s
        response to the exertion of an individual man or of individual men &#8212; given
        by nature directly and exclusively to him or to them. Thus there inheres
        in such things a right of private property, which originates from and
        goes back to the source of ownership, the maker of the thing. This right
        is anterior to the state and superior to its enactments, so that, as
        we hold, it is a violation of natural right and an injustice to the private
        owner for the state to tax the processes and products of labor. They
        do not belong to Caesar. They are things that God, of whom nature is
        but an expression, gives to those who apply for them in the way he has
        appointed &#8212; by labor.</p>
      <p>But who will dare trace the individual ownership of land to any grant
        from the Maker of land? What does nature give to such ownership? how
        does she in any way recognize it? Will any one show from difference of
        form or feature, of stature or complexion, from dissection of their bodies
        or analysis of their powers and needs, that one man was intended by nature
        to own land and another to live on it as his tenant? That which derives
        its existence from man and passes away like him, which is indeed but
        the evanescent expression of his labor, man may hold and transfer as
        the exclusive property of the individual; but how can such individual
        ownership attach to land, which existed before man was, and which continues
        to exist while the generations of men come and go &#8212; the unfailing
        storehouse that the Creator gives to man for &#8220;the daily supply
        of his daily wants&#8221;?</p>
      <p>          Clearly, the private ownership of land is from the state, not from
            nature. Thus, not merely can no objection be made on the score of
            morals when
          it is proposed that the state shall abolish it altogether, but insomuch
          as it is a violation of natural right, its existence involving a gross
          injustice on the part of the state, an &#8220;impious violation of the
          benevolent intention of the Creator,&#8221; it is a moral duty that the
          state so abolish it.</p>
      <p><strong>So far from there being anything unjust in taking the full value
          of landownership for the use of the community, the real injustice is
          in
        leaving it in private hands &#8212; an injustice that amounts to robbery
        and murder.</strong></p>
      <p>And when your Holiness shall see this I have no fear that you will listen
        for one moment to the impudent plea that before the community can take
        what God intended it to take &#8212; before men who have been disinherited
        of their natural rights can be restored to them, the present owners of
        land shall first be compensated.</p>
      <p><strong>For not only will you see that the single tax will directly
          and largely benefit small landowners, whose interests as laborers and
          capitalists
        are much greater than their interests as landowners, and that though
        the great landowners &#8212; or rather the propertied class in general
        among whom the profits of landownership are really divided through mortgages,
        rent-charges, etc. &#8212; would relatively lose, they too would be absolute
        gainers</strong> in the increased prosperity and improved morals; but more quickly,
        more strongly, more peremptorily than from any calculation of gains or
        losses would your duty as a man, your faith as a Christian, forbid you
        to listen for one moment to any such paltering with right and wrong.</p>
      <p>Where the state takes some land for public uses it is only just that
        those whose land is taken should be compensated, otherwise some landowners
        would be treated more harshly than others. But where, by a measure affecting
        all alike, rent is appropriated for the benefit of all, there can be
        no claim to compensation. Compensation in such case would be a continuance
        of the same in another form &#8212; the giving to landowners in the shape
        of interest of what they before got as rent. Your Holiness knows that
        justice and injustice are not thus to be juggled with, and when you fully
        realize that land is really the storehouse that God owes to all his children,
        you will no more listen to any demand for compensation for restoring
        it to them than Moses would have listened to a demand that Pharaoh should
        be compensated before letting the children of Israel go.</p>
      <p>Compensated for what? For giving up what has been unjustly taken? The
        demand of landowners for compensation is not that. We do not seek to
        spoil the Egyptians. We do not ask that what has been unjustly taken
        from laborers shall be restored. We are willing that bygones should be
        bygones and to leave dead wrongs to bury their dead. We propose to let
        those who by the past appropriation of land values have taken the fruits
        of labor to retain what they have thus got. We merely propose that for
        the future such robbery of labor shall cease &#8212; that for the future,
        not for the past, landholders shall pay to the community the rent that
        to the community is justly due. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>This leads to no end of problems. In the United

        and waste energy
            and resources. You don&#8217;t think under-use of land is that big a deal?
            Consider the fact that in the five boroughs of New York City, 7.5% of its
            land, or 18.6 square miles, is vacant. That&#8217;s buildable land, not
            parks or streets. And, of course, a great deal more land in New York, as
            in every other city, is used somewhat, but far less than the local economy
            would support. New York City has about 80 people per acre of residential
            land. That means that New York&#8217;s vacant land could house another
            956,000 people at current density levels, without even starting to
            use its vast stock of under-used land.</p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">

      <p>Even though downtowns are underbuilt, people

            leapfrogs, using far more land than is necessary, jacking up the price
            of farmland near the city &#8212; so that local farms can no longer compete.
            All this sprawl creates more and more need for roads &#8212; provided by
            tax dollars, of course. With all these roads, and all these cars, public
            transportation systems become less popular and harder to finance. This
            chokes the cities with even more traffic, making them even less desirable

          Post's Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix:
          FAQ</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Q33. Would not the full single tax destroy the basis of all credit &#8212; land
            values?</em><br>
A. The full single tax &#8212; one hundred per cent of annual ground rent &#8212; would
wipe out land values, which are but the capitalization of rent. But land values
are not the basis of credit. Merchants do not prefer mortgages on land as security
for commercial debts, unless they hope to get the ownership of the land through
foreclosure. The true basis of every man's credit, from the consumer at the cross-roads
store to the great retail merchant at the factory or the jobbing house, is honesty,
opportunity, and ability. He who will pay his debts if he can, and has an opportunity
to earn enough to pay them with, and is able to make good use of the opportunity,
needs no land values to offer as a basis for commercial credit. He has the ideal
basis of all credit. And this basis of credit every man could have if the single
tax were in operation.</p>
        <p><em>Q49. Would the single tax abolish interest?</em><br>
          A. I do not think so. Interest properly understood is a form of wages,
            and so far from abolishing it, the single tax, which would tend to
            increase all forms of wages, would tend to increase interest. But
            monopoly profits are often confounded with interest, and by force
            of association have given to interest a bad name; these would be
            minimized if not wholly abolished by the single tax. It is impossible
            to answer this question intelligibly to everyone who asks it, without
            requiring him to be specific; for it is seldom that two persons agree
            as to what they mean by interest. The Western farmer thinks of the
            high rate that he pays, partly for risk, partly from his ignorance
            of the modus operandi of banking, and partly because legitimate banking
            facilities are scarce in his Community; the Wall Street operator
            thinks of the premiums that he pays for currency in times of stress
            to tide him over from day to day; others think of &quot;interest&quot; on
            government bonds, and others of dividends of companies with valuable
            land rights. None of these payments are really interest, and the
            single tax would tend to rid society of them. But that advantage
            which the workmen enjoy whose implements and materials are already
            gathered, over those who have yet to devote time to gathering implements
            and materials, an advantage which is expressed in money and as interest
            upon capital, will not, I should think, be abolished by anything
            that man can do. The value of such an advantage is part of the wages
            of the labor that creates it. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

      Affordable</b></small></div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The implementation of our ideas
          would have a dramatic effect in
          making housing more affordable. The principal reason why housing
          costs have risen so much is that the price of land has risen
          enormously. Some increase in the price of access to land is a natural
      accompaniment of an increasing population.</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the very great increases of
          recent years, which have made it
          nearly impossible for young families to afford houses of their own,
          have additional causes. The implementation of our ideas would bring
      down the price of access to land in three ways.</small></p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, much land is held
        off the market by speculators who may wait generations do decide to
        develop it.</span> The introduction of a fee for holding land, whether
        used or not, equal to the rental value of the land, will induce
        speculators to either develop this land themselves or turn it over to
        someone who will.</small></li>
        <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, an important
        cause of higher prices for access to land by those who wish to build
        low-cost housing is zoning restrictions. </span>These restrictions are
        introduced by political factions that already have their houses and do
        not mind if housing becomes scarcer. It just raises the market value of
        their homes. But if a rise in land values were accompanied by rises in
        the fees that existing residents had to pay for the use of the land on
        which their houses sit, they would have an incentive to do what they
        could to make land plentiful rather than scarce, and zoning
        restrictions could be expected to diminish.</small></li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Third, a person who wishes to own a house
        must borrow money to cover the price of buying the title to the land on
        which the house sits as well as the cost of the house itself. </span>If
        the use of land required the payment of a fee equal to the rental value
        of land, so that the selling price of land titles became virtually
        zero, then the amount of money that a family would have to borrow to
        purchase a house would fall. ...&nbsp; <a

  <div style="text-align: left;"></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>YOU MAY THINK
      the largest category of assets in this countrly is
      industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
      Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
      largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
      America's wealth and more than 60
  percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
  <div style="text-align: left;"></div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Most capital gains are land-value gains.
      The big players do not
      want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
      capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
      possible
      from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
      pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
      much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
      possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
      and get to keep the "capital gain".
  </small></div>
  <div style="text-align: left;"></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This price appreciation is actually a "land
      gain", that is, it's
      not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
      sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
      rises
      because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
      rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
      gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
      developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
      developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
  rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>Of course,
      investing most surplus income and wealth in land has
      been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
      debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
      creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
      borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
      bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
      surplus
      is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
      because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
      grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
  choice.</small></p>

      </span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
      wealth
      by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
      not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
      claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
  of rent and interest.</small>&nbsp; <strong>... </strong>  </p>

      free
      lunch</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil wins at the point where he
      convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
      Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
      kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
      invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
      mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well.,
      breathlessly focused on their own
      particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
    land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
      are
      out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
      than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
      on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
  the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></div>
  <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small></small></div>
  <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School
      economists insist that no free lunch exists.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> But
      when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
      statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
      one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
      lunch.</span> However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
      the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
      proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
      called
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
      characteristically in the form of land rent.
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
      appraising that undervalues the real
  income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>PROPERTY IS
      APPRAISED in two ways. Both start by estimating its
      market value.
    <b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of buildings
      from this overall value, designating the remainder as the value of
      land.&nbsp; ...<b> The building-residual approach</b> starts by
      valuing the land, and treats the difference as representing the
  building's value. <strong>... </strong>  </small></p>
  <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Everyone
      recognized the absurdity of calculations depicting all
      the corporate land in America as having a negative value in 1993.
      Suppose somebody same to you and said: "I'll give you $4 billion, but
      there's a catch. Along with the $4 billion in cash, you will have to
      accept ownership of all the land owned by every non-financial
      corporation in the United States." Most people no doubt would see
      that they were being given assets much more valuable than $4 billion,
      and would jump at the offer. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
      Fed's statistic would be dismissed
      as a comic exercise showing how economists tend to lapse into
      otherworldly speculation. But in this case the motive is all too
      worldly. Looking beneath the surface, one finds the not-so-invisible
      hand of self-interest by the real estate industry and its financial
  backers.</span></small></p>
  <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>To give the Fed
      economists their due, they evidently came to the
      conclusion that their statistics were fatally flawed. The September
      1997 balance sheet estimates made a start along new lines by
      including a calculation reflecting the original (historical) cost of
      buildings. This gave land a positive value. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But nationwide totals
      were no longer compiled. No longer was there a line labeled "land,"
      nor does the Fed publish a residual number for market value less the
      historical cost (or even the replacement cost) of buildings. Instead
      of making better land estimates, the Fed has dropped what had become
      a political and statistical hot potato. 1994 is the last year for
  which it has estimated economy-wide land and building values.</span></small></p>
  <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>This leaves in
      limbo the macro-economists and business analysts
      whose business is to explain the <b>finance, insurance and real
      estate (FIRE)</b> sector's dominant role in the economy. According to
      the land-residual appraisal technique, high-rise buildings seem to
      have the lowest land values. Real estate interests argue that this is
      realistic, because at least in New York City the higher a building
      is, the more of a subsidy its developers need, given the economics of
      space involved for elevators, surrounding air space and so forth. The
      land itself is assigned a negative value as a statistically balancing
      residual reflecting the difference between the building's high
  construction costs and its lower market value. <strong>... </strong>  </small></p>
  <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In view of real
      estate's dominant role in the economy, it is
      ironic that no attempt has been made to provide better statistics.
    <b>My research has shown that the Fed's methodology undervalues land
    by as much as $4.5 trillion.</b> As matters stood in 1994, for
      instance, the Fed estimated the U.S. economy to hold some $20
      trillion in real assets (excluding human capital, for which no
      official statistics are published). The land's value was calculated
      to be $4.4 trillion, and building values $9 trillion. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">My estimates
      based on historical values suggests that land rather than buildings
      represents two thirds of the nation's overall real estate value -- $9
  trillion, leaving building values at just half this amount.</span>&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong>  </small></p>
  <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The
      commercial loft building in which I lived rose in price
      from $40,000 in 1986 to $120,000 in 1980 and $4,000,000 in 2000.</b>
    This sharp increase cannot be explainable by rising building costs.
    <b>The building itself steadily deteriorated.</b> All that increased
      was its site value. Today, of course, that property a block from the
      World Trade Center has fallen back in price, just as many new buyers
      had renovated their structures. The site's value changed without any
      significant reference to construction costs. One must infer that it
  is the site that determines the property's value.</small></p>
  <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In a thriving real estate market appraisers
      typically use a rule
      of thumb in allocating resale prices as between land and buildings to
      reflect their pre-existing proportions. Buildings typically are
      assumed to account for between 40 percent and 60 percent of the
      property's value. As a result, building values are estimated to grow
      along with a property's overall sales value. </span>This appraisal
      practice
      is made to appear plausible as the pace of asset-price inflation
      tends to go hand in hand with rising construction costs, and hence in
  the theoretical replacement cost of buildings.</small></p>
  <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>As noted, the
      anomaly occurs when real estate prices fall. Real
      estate prices are volatile, while construction costs rarely dip more
      than slightly, if at all. When real estate prices turn down, they
      often plunge below the reproduction cost of buildings. Hence, the
      residual ("land") rises and falls much more sharply than do building
      replacement costs (which are estimated as rising at a fairly steady
  pace) and overall property values.<strong> ...</strong>  </small></p>
  <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Real estate
      industry's priorities</b>
  </small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>REAL ESTATE
      LOBBIES recognize that what is not seen is less likely
      to be taxed. What is not quantified for public policy-makers to see
      clearly may avoid taxes, leaving property owners with a larger
      after-tax return. They prefer land-residual's capital gains
      statistics at the national level, even as individual investors seek
  site-value gains at the local level.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>This explains
      the seeming irony that investors in an industry
      dealing primarily with the development of land sites have campaigned
      to minimize the statistical treatment of land. Relegating land to
      merely secondary status enables the real estate industry to depict
      its "capital" gains as resulting from cost inflation and hence the
      reproduction costs of buildings -- whose value is allowed to be
      depreciated and re-depreciated at rising values over time. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The free
      lunch of land-price gains is unseen as attention is diverted from the
      real estate bubble and land-price inflation to building costs. These
      fiscal considerations help to explain why it has been so hard to get
      Washington to produce national land value statistics. ...
  </span></small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><small>Whether the
      gains come from selling the property or from borrowing
      more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
      in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
      That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
      and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
  the strategies they developed over the past half century.</small></p>

      California. This is partly
      because the lands are here, but moreso because certain places in
      California are good places to live. One of the advantages of receiving
      property as opposed to labor income is it lets one choose his

    Also included here are California-based corporations. A corporation's
"base" refers simply to the site of its headquarters: its shareholders

    Institutions acquire land for their operations and then it tends to
      stick to them for various reasons. It is tax free, for one, so long as
      they retain it (and do not use it commercially). They are not subject
      to corporate raids. Thus there is no mechanism whereby the current
      opportunity cost of land is felt by management. It never appears in
      their budgets; they never need compete for or justify it. College
      Boards are not accountable to any public body, a precedent set by

      <small>It's both fascinating and disappointing to see how excessive
      rates of
      interest are today so generally and meekly accepted by the public. Only
      until a few centuries ago usury, which is the old word for the practice
      of lending money at exorbitant rates of interest, was one of the
      long-standing worst sins of Christendom. Islam widely outlaws interest
      and excessive profit margins of any kind even today.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>In many respects, the basis for this prohibition is as valid now
      as it
      was then. It is this: a significant proportion of the interest demanded
      is immoral in that it is unearned and therefore undeserved. Certainly
      the lender needs to be reimbursed to take account of administrative
      costs, the effect of inflation, and the element of risk involved, but
      what has the lender done to deserve a rate of return above and beyond
      this?</small><br>

      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">LAND, AGAIN</span></small><br>
      <small>However varied the factors determining the rate of interest may
      be, the
      land issue plays an overriding role. Essentially, the rate of return
      available from land props up the rate of return available to
      moneylenders (i.e. the profitability of holding land supports excessive
      interest rates).</small><br>

    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>The first, its natural agricultural fertility, is of
      little importance in the modern world. 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>The second, its locational value, remains as important as
      ever
      and is produced by the activities of society, but ends up in private
      hands under land monopoly capitalism.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The new and extremely important
      point is that, in the long run, the
      rate of return available to investors in land is the most lucrative of
      all, effectively acting as a de facto benchmark as the highest rate of
      return, allowing for risk. Indeed, during the period 1960 - 2000 in
      Australia, land values increased on average 5.8% pa, whereas household
      disposable income only increased 1.96% pa. This gets us back to the
      very nature of land. The fact that it is limited in supply and is an
      unavoidable necessity for human existence means that rising populations
      make land increasingly scarce and valuable, thus bidding up its price.
      The other powerful, sure boost to land values arises from the fact that
      the locational value of land is increased by society, particularly
      through the provision of infrastructure. And history has shown that,
      wherever an industry has boomed through enterprise and inventiveness,
      land prices soar in its vicinity. For a recent example of this ageless
      phenomenon, look at the recent spectacular rises in land prices in
      Silicon Valley. So, with land being a sure-fire investment winner, why
      would anyone lend for a rate less than that available from investing in
      land? The corollary here is that, as we collect LVT and cut out the
      opportunities to profit from owning land, interest rates must then
      fall. The banking issue is not simple and deserves its own section
      which follows, where the privilege of banks to create credit is
      specifically dealt with.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">BANKS AND THE MONEY SUPPLY</span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>There is another great
      and rarely-seen source of privilege milking us -
      the privilege of private banks "creating" money out of credit.
      Essentially, through the so-called multiplier effect, banks can lend
      out far more money than they have as deposits, all the while charging
      interest as if the basis for their lending was based on something as
      real as the banknotes in your wallet. Furthermore, banks have claimed a
      special status and importance such that, when their irresponsible and
      risky practice of lending money they don't possess gets them in
      trouble, governments (read: ordinary mugs like you and I!) often have
      to come to the rescue and bail them out.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">FOR PEOPLE, NOT PRIVILEGE!</span></small><br>
      <small>The "privilege of inventing money", like the privilege to own
      land,
      needs to become a source of wealth for society instead of being, as it
      is now, a source of power for a few at the expense of everyone else.
    The fraud consists:</small>    </div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>In inventing money disguised as loans, and therefore
      burdened with a debt that has no reason to be</small></li>
      <li><small>In inventing money not at the time and for the purpose
      needed,
      but at the whim of banks and their clients, i.e. completely divorced
      from the real economy</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The story of how the banking
      system acquired the privilege of
      defrauding the public can be read elsewhere. Here it is important to
      note that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">high interest
      rates are indissolubly linked to the land monopoly</span>.
      When land, instead of being widely distributed, is grabbed by a
      powerful minority, investing in land becomes the most profitable type
      of investment, with returns guaranteed with increasing population and
      public infrastructure growing around it.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>With such high returns to land, no one therefore would deposit
      money in
      a bank at an interest lower than what land can offer. But banks have to
      make money, so they have to lend at an interest higher than that at
      which they borrow. Result: two economies come into being: one reserved
      to banks and money manipulators earning returns while creating no
      wealth, and the other, the real economy of production which is either
      starved of necessary liquidity or forced to pay usurious interest.</small><br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A COMMON RESOURCE</span></small><br>
      <small>The solution is to consider money as what it is, i.e. an
      artificial
      common resource. As such, it should be issued by the public monetary
      authority debt-free, when the natural growth of the economy dictates.
      How can we determine if the real wealth of an economy has grown
      sufficiently in order for the government to issue more money? By the
      value of land, again! Instead of basing our money supply on reserves of
      gold and the whims of bankers, money should be based on the real wealth
      of our nation, and nothing reflects our real wealth better than the
      value of our land and natural resources. Build infrastructure and our
      land values increase. Clean up the environment, reduce crime, and
      generally make our nation a better place to live and our land values
      increase. But do something dumb like get involved in a war and our land
      values decrease. Land and natural resources should be the true
      indicator of our real underlying wealth instead of paper profits, funny
      money and ingots of gold. Some geonomists have been increasing
      proposing such a radical monetary reform which would abolish the
      outrageous privileges that banks possess.</small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
      one
      thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
      the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
      political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
      tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
      address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
      could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
      buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
      the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
      powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
      efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
      site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
      is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
      <br>
      <font size="3"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First-time home
      buyers make out like bandits. They'd pay a higher
      land dues to their community but lower total taxes to government, a
      lower price to the seller, and a lower mortgage to the lender. Is it
      fair that one group should benefit so prodigiously? Yes.</span> In many
      US
      cities, renters now outnumber owners. High rates of tenancy, as shown
      in Goldschmidt's 1940s study of the Central California towns Arvin and
      Dinuba, engender apathy and indifference, which are bad for democracy,
      community involvement, street safety, and environmental protection. The
      sooner young families can become homeowners, the better off all members
      of society will be. ...<br>
      <br>
      </small></font><font size="3"><small>While beneficiaries have a hard
      time envisioning their gains, losers
      have an easy time calculating their losses. The big loser is not
      homeowners; while losing equity, they keep all earnings untaxed. Nor is
      it realtors, while losing their few big sales, they gain many smaller
      ones. Nor is it developers; while paying higher infrastructure fees,
      they'd pay less for prime land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">No,
      the big losers would be banks who'd
      have to readjust to pre-World War II levels of lending rates</span>. As
      they
      probably won't want to give up their unearned income, advocates of PTS
      will need to use moral arguments (as in the struggle against slavery)
      to gain public support and use practical arguments to pry realtors,
      developers, service businesses, and small businesses aside, thereby
      isolating lenders.<br>
      </small></font><br>
      <font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
      needs a

      headed for the treasuries of distant capitols and the bank vaults of
    distant lenders.</small></p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Forgoing natural values makes

      <p>Dividends from Common Assets</p>
      <p>A cushion of reliable income is a wonderful thing. It can be saved for
        rainy days or used to pursue happiness on sunny days. It can encourage
        people to take risks, care for friends and relatives, or volunteer for
        community service. For low-income families, it can pay for basic necessities.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the absence of reliable income is a terrible thing. It heightens
        anxiety and fear. It diminishes our ability to cope with crises and transitions.
        It traps many families on the knife&#8217;s edge of poverty, and makes
        it harder for the poor to rise.</p>
      <p>So why don&#8217;t we, as Monopoly does, pay everyone some regular income &#8212; not
        through redistribution of income, but through predistribution of common
        property? One state &#8212; Alaska &#8212; already does this. As noted
        earlier, the Alaska Permanent Fund uses revenue from state oil leases
        to invest in stocks, bonds, and similar assets, and from those investments
        pays yearly dividends to every resident. Alaska&#8217;s model can be
        extended to any state or nation, whether or not they have oil. We could,
        for instance, have an American Permanent Fund that pays equal dividends
        to long-term residents of all 50 states. The reason is, we jointly own
        many valuable assets.</p>
      <p>Recall our discussion about common property trusts. These trusts could
        crank down pollution and earn money from selling ever-scarcer pollution
        permits. The scarcer the permits get, the higher their prices would go.
        Less pollution would equal more revenue. Over time, trillions of dollars
        could flow into an American Permanent Fund.</p>
      <p>What could we do with that common income? In Alaska the deal with oil
        revenue is 75 percent to government and 25 percent to citizens. For an
        American Permanent Fund, I&#8217;d favor a 50/50 split, because paying
        dividends to citizens is so important. Also, when scarce ecosystems are
        priced above zero, the cost of living will go up and people will need
        compensation; this wasn&#8217;t, and isn&#8217;t, the case in Alaska.
        I&#8217;d also favor earmarking the government&#8217;s dollars for specific
        public goods, rather than tossing them into the general treasury. This
        not only ensures identifiable public benefits; it also creates constituencies
        who&#8217;ll defend the revenue sharing system.</p>
      <p>Waste absorption isn&#8217;t the only common resource an American Permanent
        Fund could tap.<strong> Consider also, the substantial contribution society
        makes to stock market values. As noted earlier, private corporations
        can inflate
        their value dramatically by selling shares on a regulated stock exchange.
        The extra value derives from the enlarged market of investors who can
        now buy the corporation&#8217;s shares. Given a total stock market valuation
        of about $15 trillion, this socially created liquidity premium is worth
        roughly $5 trillion.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>At the moment, this $5 trillion gift flows mostly to the 5 percent
          of the population that own more than half the private wealth. But if
          we
        wanted to, we could spread it around. We could do that by charging corporations
        for using the public trading system, just as investment bankers do. (For
        those of you who haven&#8217;t been involved in a public stock offering,
        investment bankers are like fancy doormen to a free palace. While the
        public charges almost nothing to use the capital markets, investment
        bankers exact hefty fees.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The public&#8217;s fee could be in cash or stock. Let&#8217;s say we
        required publicly traded companies to deposit 1 percent of their shares
        each year in the American Permanent Fund for ten years &#8212; reaching
        a total of 10 percent of their shares. This would be our price not just
        for using a regulated stock exchange, but also for all the other privileges
        (limited liability, perpetual life, copyrights and patents, and so on)
        that we currently bestow on private corporations for free.</strong></p>
      <p>In due time, the American Permanent Fund would have a diversified portfolio
        worth several trillion dollars. Like its Alaskan counterpart, it would
        pay equal yearly dividends to everyone. As the stock market rose and
        fell, so would everyone&#8217;s dividend checks. A rising tide would
        lift all boats. America would truly be an &#8220;ownership society.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    <p>Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">What To Do About
          the Real Estate Bubble</a><br>
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What&#8217;s bubbling, and until when?</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      Sellers are happy. So are developers and speculators. Real estate has
      gone all bubbly, and that bubble has gone ballistic. What goes up,
      however, must soon do something else. ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Actually, it&#8217;s not housing whose price has entered the
      stratosphere. Buildings age &#8211; get older, more worn out. What&#8217;s getting
      more valuable is the land, the location &#8211; whether it has a building on
      it or not. Buildings you can make more of, but land you can not,
      especially locations along the coasts or on the good side of town. None
      of that would matter if you could ever get buildings to hover around in
      the air. Meanwhile however, speculators are happy.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>... What&#8217;s seemingly good for landowners is not necessarily good
      for the economy. As people spend more on land, something nobody
      produced, they spend less on output, things people do produce. As
      producers get less money spent on their products, eventually they take
      the hint and produce less. "Produce less" is another way of spelling
      recession.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Plus, more expensive land means heavier borrowing to buy it.
      More debt means more inflation and less stability. When producers cut
      back, borrowers have a much harder time paying back their debts. As
      people go bankrupt, they drag others down with them. A collapsing house
      of cards is another way of spelling depression.</small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preventing bubbles?</span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If land values didn&#8217;t get
      inflated, of
      course they would not have to get deflated.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Call it mutual compensation for
      deprivation from part of our common natural heritage. </span> While in
      rhythmic
      systems, prices must rise and fall, but they need not boom then bust;
      they could climb then glide. What would temper economies, preventing
      bubbles? Rather than let a few lucky owners collect land values,
      neighbors would have to recover land values for themselves. Nobody made
      land, and no lone owner made its value; the presence of society in
      general did that. Plus, for excluding everyone else from their sites,
      owners owe everyone else, as each one of us owes everyone for excluding
      them. </small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To recover land value,
      government
      could either transform the property tax into a land tax or replace it
      and other taxes with land dues or land use fees or an annual deed fee.
      ... </span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To pay the land dues, owners use their
      land efficiently; owners who had been speculating get busy and develop.</span>
      No longer allowed to tax anything that moves, local governments, too,
      which presently let acres of abandoned urban land and buildings lie
      fallow, get busy, too, and make sure to get those acres into the hands
      of ambitious owners who&#8217;ll pay land dues. More locations put to use and
      more buildings put up increases supply, which dampens price.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Better still, as government recovers
      land rent, that leaves owners with less land rent to capitalize into
      land price. Hence buyers need not borrow so much.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Land would still rise in value. With
      every discovery of a nearby natural resource. With the opening of every
      new bridge. With every techno-advance, as silicon wafers did for
      Silicon Valley. With every jump in income and drop in crime, land value
      rises. But no longer into a bubble. Because every rise would find its
      way &#8211; via land dues and rent dividends &#8211; into everyone&#8217;s pockets. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      If the 18-year average holds for this cycle, then real estate still has
      a few more years of sucking all the investments and purchasing power
      out of the rest of the economy. Land is still able to soak it all up,
      and lenders are still willing to pump more in. So despite the premature
      panic (markets almost never do what everybody says they&#8217;re going to
      do), Mankiw&#8217;s 2007 would be the earliest that the current bubble would
      burst, and 2008 is just as likely.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      Then land prices will fall for a few years. Since the run-up was steep,
      the drop will be, too &#8211; after correcting for inflation, maybe as much
      as 50%. Which will be an enormous relief for the economy &#8211; just what
      the doctor ordered. With land affordable again, a new cycle can get
      under way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether the new one will
      be boom and bust or climb and glide is up to us, whether we&#8217;re willing
      to practice geonomics, to forego taxes and subsidies in favor of land
      dues and a Citizens Dividend.</span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While I don&#8217;t mind the current
      gambling, I do mind the widening of the cavernous gulf between haves
      and have-nots, and I boil over while workweek grows more onerous, and
      just seethe watching vacant lots and abandoned buildings push
      development out from urban cores to sprawl on suburban farmland. To
      reverse that, let&#8217;s let go of the individual owner&#8217;s hold on land rent
      and share Earth&#8217;s worth equitably among us all. We&#8217;ll all be glad we

    Michael Hudson and Kris Feder: <a
 href="../docs/Hudson_Feder_RECGD.html">Real Estate and the Capital
      Gains Debate</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
      Capital gains taxation has been a divisive issue in Congress at least
      since the debates surrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which, aiming
      to eliminate tax loopholes and shelters and preferences, repealed
      preferentially low tax rates for long-term gains.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> To
      bring effective capital gains tax rates back down again was President
      Bush&#8217;s &#8220;top priority in tax policy.&#8220;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> In
      1989, Senate Democrats blocked a determined drive to reduce effective
      tax rates on the part of Bush, Republican Senators Packwood, Dole and
      others, and a few Democratic allies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> The
      administration argued that the tax cuts would stimulate economic growth
      and induce asset sales, thereby actually increasing federal tax
      revenues; Congressional Democrats countered that the plan benefited
      mainly the wealthy, and that tax revenues would in fact decline.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> The
      Joint Committee on Taxation projected that budget shortfalls beginning
      in 1991 would sum to about $24 billion by 1994 --&nbsp; and that most
      of the
      direct benefits would go to individuals with over $200,000 in taxable
      income. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that a third of the savings
      would be enjoyed by those with gross incomes over one million dollars.
      <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
      <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>What is missing
      from the discussion is a sense of
      proportion as to how capital gains are made. Data that is available
      from the Department of Commerce, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve Board
      indicate that <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">roughly
      two thirds of the economy's capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains are taken, not in
      the stock market -- much less in new offerings -- but in real </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">estate. ... </span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>This
      policy brief seeks to elucidate the role of real estate in the
      capital gains issue, indicating the quantitative orders of magnitude
    involved.. We offer two main observations. </small>    </div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">generous </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">capital
      consumption allowances (CCAs) </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">greatly
      magnify the proportion of real estate income taken as taxable capital
      gains.</span> Capital gains accrue not only on newly constructed
      buildings, of course, but also on land and old buildings being sold and
      resold. Our tax code allows for properties to be re-depreciated by
      their new owners after a sale or swap, permitting real estate investors
      to recapture principal again and again on the same structure. When CCAs
      have been excessive relative to true economic depreciation, as they
      were during the 1980s, capital gains have been commensurately larger
      than the actual increase in property prices. As Charts la and lb
      illustrate, capital consumption allowances in real estate dwarf those
      in other industries. <br>
      </small></li>
      <li><small>Second, <span style="font-weight: bold;">very little of
      real
      estate cash flow is taxable as ordinary income, so the capital gains
      tax is currently the only major federal levy paid by the real estate
      industry.</span> CCAs and tax-deductible mortgage interest payments
      combine to exempt most of real estate cash flow from the income tax.
      This encourages debt pyramiding as it throws the burden of public
      finance onto other taxpayers.
      </small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
      central conclusion of our study is
      that better statistics on asset
      values and capital gains are needed -- or, more to the point, a better
      accounting format. The economic effects of a capital gains tax depend
      upon how the gains are made. </span>The present GNP/NIPA format fails
      to
      differentiate between wealth and overhead; between value from
      production and value from obligation. In particular, theory and
      measurement should distinguish real estate from other sources of
      capital gains -- aid, within the category of real estate, distinguish
      land from built improvements. Markets for immovable structures and for
      land have distinctive inherent features<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small> and
      are shaped by distinctive institutional constraints.</small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Our second major conclusion is
      that, at least until
      re-depreciation of second-hand buildings is disallowed, a capital gains
      tax cut would be unlikely to stimulate much new investment and
      employment from its largest beneficiary, the real estate industry.
      </span>Depreciation allowances and mortgage interest absorb so much of
      the
      ongoing cash flow as to leave little taxable income. Mortgage interest
      payments, which now consume the lion&#8217;s share of cash flow, are
      tax-deductible, while CCAs offset much of what remains of rental
      income. On an industry-wide basis, in fact, NIPA statistics reveal that
      depreciation offsets <span style="font-style: italic;">more </span>than
      the total reported income. As Charts 2a, 2b, and 2c illustrate, real
      estate corporations and partnerships have recently reported net losses
      year after year. ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The result is that real estate corporations pay minimal income
      taxes -- some $1.3 billion in 1988, just one percent of the $137
      billion
      paid by corporate America as a whole.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">21</span></small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">22</span></small> These
      three symbiotically linked sectors thus were left with only capital
      gains
      taxes to pay on their cash flow.</small><br>
      Comparable figures are not available on non-corporate income tax
      liability, but the FIRE sector (finance, insurance, and real estate)
      reported negative income of $3.4 billion in 1988, out of a total $267
    billion of non-farm proprietors&#8217; income.</div>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      <small>The central point for capital gains tax policy is that taxable
      capital
      gains in real estate consist of more than just the increase in land and
      building prices. They represent the widening margin of sales price over
      the property&#8217;s depreciated value. The tax accountant&#8217;s book-value gains
      result from charging off capital
      consumption allowances as a tax credit against cash flow. The more
      generous are the capital consumption write-offs for real estate, the
      more rapidly a property&#8217;s book value is written down. The fiction of
      fast write-off is eventually &#8220;caught&#8221; as a capital gain when the real
      estate is either sold or refinanced.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Excessive
      depreciation allowances thus convert ordinary income into capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains. Moreover,
      capital gains are the only point at which most real estate income is </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">taxed&nbsp; </span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>To
      abolish the capital gains tax would annul the entire accumulated income
      tax liability which real estate owners have converted into a capital
      gains obligation. The income written off over the years as
      over-depreciation would not be caught at all. The economy's largest
      industry would have its income rendered tax-free. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">... </span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span><small><big
 style="font-weight: bold;">Depreciation and
      Capital Gains</big></small></small><br>
      <small><small><big style="font-weight: bold;"></big></small></small><br>
      <small><small><big style="font-weight: bold;"></big></small>Much of the
      statistical measurement problem derives from
      the fact that capital gains in real estate differ from those in other
      industries. While all investors presumably would prefer to take their
      income in non-taxable forms and to defer whatever tax obligation is
      due, the tax benefits to the real estate industry have no analog in
      manufacturing, agriculture, power generation, transportation, wholesale
      and retail trade, or other services. Corporations in these sectors pay
      taxes on their net incomes. Out of their after-tax earnings they then
      pay dividends, on which stockholders in turn must pay income tax. By
      contrast, little or none of the rental cash flow received by real
      estate investors is taxable, because generous capital consumption
      allowances are treated as costs and deducted from the net income
      reported to the IRS.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The effect of calculating capital gains for real estate on the
      basis of
      depreciated book values may be illustrated by the following example. A
      building bought in 1985 has probably been fully written off today,
      thanks to the generous CCAs enacted by the 1981 tax code that remained
      in place through 1986. For a parcel bought in 1985 for $100 million and
      sold today for $110 million, the recorded gain is not merely the 10
      percent increase in market price, but <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the entire value of the
      building</span>, perhaps $65 million based on the real estate
      industry&#8217;s average land-to-building assessment ratios. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
      <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>Landlords
      already deduct from earnings as normal business expenses
      their maintenance and repair expenditures, undertaken to counteract the
      wear and tear of buildings.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> A rule of
      thumb in the real estate industry
      is that such expenditures typically consume about ten percent of rental
      revenue.</span> More importantly, although nearly all&nbsp;land
      gains are made fully taxable, there is little reason to assume that
      physical deterioration should be compensated by a special allowance to
      enable the landlord to
      recover his capital investment within a given number of years. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Depreciation rules are not the only reason why the real estate
      sector declares little taxable income. Out of their gross rental
      income, landlords pay state and local property taxes, a tiny modicum of
      income tax, and interest on their mortgage debt. A large proportion of
      cash flow is turned over to lenders as mortgage payments. Since the
      early 1970s, interest paid by the real estate industry has been much
      larger than the figures reported for net rental income. As Charts 3a,
      3b, 3c, and 3d illustrate, real estate investors and homeowners have
      become the financial sector&#8217;s prime customers. According to the Federal
      Reserve Board, 1994 mortgage debt of $4.3 trillion represented some 46
      percent of the economy's $9.3 trillion private nonfinancial debt, and a
      third of the total $12.8 trillion U.S. debt.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> NIPA
      statistics indicate that about 70 percent of loans to business
      borrowers currently are made to the real estate sector, making it the
      major absorber of savings and payer of interest. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
      <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>Most cash flow
      now ends up neither with developers nor with the tax
      authorities, but as interest paid to banks, insurance companies and
      other mortgage lenders. In fact, <span style="font-weight: bold;">mortgage
      interest now absorbs seven
      percent of national income, up from just one percent in the late 1940s</span>.
      <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>One effect of favorable depreciation and capital gains tax
      treatment is
      to spur debt pyramiding for the real estate industry. The tax structure
      provides a distortionary incentive for real estate holders to borrow
      excessively, converting rental income into a nontaxable mortgage
      interest cost while waiting for capital gains to accrue. This,
      alongside financial deregulation of the nation&#8217;s S&amp;Ls, was a major
      factor in the over-building spree of the 80's. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Reported capital gains in real estate were understated as a
      result of
      exclusions. On the other hand, much direct investment included the cost
      of land, commercial buildings, and plant and equipment. Taking this
      into account, we estimate that roughly 70 percent of the capital gains
      calculated by the IRS for 1985 probably represent real estate. Even
      this estimate may understate the role of land and real estate. In 1985,
      anticipating the planned 1986 tax reform which would raise the capital
      gains tax rate from 20 to 28 percent, many investors sold their
      securities that had registered the largest advances. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Some 40 percent of the capital gains reaped
      by selling these stocks probably represented real estate gains.</span>
      A major spur to the LBO movement driving up the stock market was an
      awareness that real estate gains were not being reflected in book
      values and share prices;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">36</span></small> as
      land prices leapt upward-funded in part by looser regulatory
      restrictions on S&amp;L lending against land -- raiders bought publicly
      traded companies and sold off their assets, including real estate, to
      pay off their junk-bond backers. In effect, not only were rental income
      and profits being converted into a flow of interest payments; so also
      were capital gains.<strong> ... </strong></small><strong><br>
      </strong><br>
      <small>When statistics are lacking, it often is because some interest
      groups are benefiting in ways they prefer not to see quantified and
      publicized. If land assessments lag behind actual increases in market
      value, for instance, land speculators, as well as homeowners, will pay
      less than their legislated tax share. Also -- and of direct relevance
      to
      our thesis -- the failure to distinguish statistics on land values and
      other real estate gains from non-real-estate capital gains in industry
      and finance makes it easier for the real estate industry to get its own
      taxes reduced along with industries in which capital gains tax cuts do
      indeed tend to spur productivity. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The LBO movement epitomizes the real estate industry&#8216;s strategy,
      applying the developer&#8217;s traditional debt-pyramiding techniques to the
      buying and selling of manufacturing companies. Raiders emulated
      developers who borrowed money to buy or construct buildings and make
      related capital improvements, agreeing to pay interest to their
      mortgage bankers or other lenders, putting down as little equity of
      their own as possible. Having set things in motion, the landlord uses
      the rental income to carry the interest, principal, taxes and
      maintenance charges while he waits for a capital gain to accrue. The
      idea is to amortize the loan as slowly as possible so as to minimize
      annual carrying charges, while paying them out of the CCA.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>For many decades securities analysts have pored over corporate
      balance
      sheets in search of undervalued real estate whose book value does not
      reflect gains in market value. From the merger and acquisition movement
      of the 1960s through the takeover wave of the&nbsp;1980s,
      the raider&#8217;s strategy has been to borrow money to buy the target
      company&#8217;s stock, and then sell off its real estate and other assets to
      repay the creditors, hoping that something will be left for himself
      after settling the debts incurred in the process. For the bankers and
      other creditors, LBOs were a way to put savings to work earning higher
      rates of interest.&nbsp; The ensuing junk bond commotion pushed
      interest rates over 15 percent for high-risk securities, whose major
      risk was that quick capital gains and the cash flow available from
      re-depreciating properties would not cover the interest payments to the
      institutional investors rounded up by Drexel Burnham and the other
      investment bankers who underwrote the takeovers.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The object of building, like buying and selling companies, is
      thus by
      no means only to earn rental income. Most cash flow is pledged to
      lenders as debt service in any case. In a world of income taxation
      subject to loopholes, sophisticated investors aim not so much to make
      profits as to reap capital gains -not only in the stock and bond
      markets, but also in real estate, other natural resources, and the
      monopoly privileges that have come to underlie much of the pricing of
      securities today.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>As developers borrow money to finance real estate purchases,
      lenders,
      for their part, use the real estate sector as a market to absorb and
      service the economy's mounting stock of savings, applying most of the
      rental cash flow to pay interest to savers. The end result is that most
      total returns are taken by the wealthiest ten percent responsible for
      nearly all the economy's net saving. Viewing US economic statistics
      from this perspective shows that not to calculate capital gains in the
      national income accounts alongside directly &#8220;earned&#8221; income helps
      foster the illusion that more equality exists among Americans than
      actually is the case. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The fact is
      that earned income is more equally distributed than unearned gains. </span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>This distinction between real estate (and by extension, other
      natural
      resource industries and monopolies) and the rest of the economy helps
      explain the familiar economic rule that inequalities of wealth tend
      historically to exceed inequalities of income. The reason is that the
      wealthiest layers of society control even more of the economy's assets
      -- and the capital gains on these assets -- than they do its income.
      They
      also obtain a larger proportion of cash flow and other non-taxable
      income than they do of taxable &#8220;earned&#8221; income. </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>This phenomenon has long been known, but not well explained.
      Edward
      Wolff has shown that wealth is more unequally distributed than income,
      but he leaves capital gains out of account in explaining how the
      American economy has grown more top-heavy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span></small> It is
      unequal wealth that is primarily responsible for generating inequality
      of incomes. The more the returns to wealth can avoid taxation by being
      categorized as capital gains, the faster this inequality will polarize
      society.</small><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>43 Wolff (1995), p. 27.
&#8220;The top
      one percent of wealth holders
      has typically held in excess of one-quarter of total household wealth,
      in comparison to the 8 or 9 percent share of income received by the top
    percentile of the income distribution.&#8221;    </small></small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      <small><small></small>Given the current US depreciation laws and
      related
      institutions, to lower the capital gains tax rate across the board is
      to steer capital and entrepreneurial resources into a search for
      unearned rather than earned income. It rewards real estate speculators
      and corporate raiders as it shifts the burden of taxation to people
      whose primary source of income is their labor. The budget crisis
      aggravated by such a policy also ends up forcing public resources to be
      sold off to meet current expenses -- sold to the very wealth-holders
      being
      freed from taxation. In this way wealth consolidates its economic power
      relative to the rest of society, and translates it into political power
      so as to shit? the tax burden onto the shoulders of others. The first
      element of this strategy has been to defer revenue into channels that
      are taxed only later, as capital gains. The second has been to tax
      these gains at a lower rate than earned income -- a&nbsp; fight that
      has broken
      out in earnest following the 1996 presidential elections.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Economic
      policy should distinguish between activities which add to
      productive capacity and those which merely add to overhead </span>This
      distinction
      elevates the policy debate above the level of merely carping about
      inequitable wealth
      distribution, an attack by have-nots on the haves, to the fundamental
      issues. What ways of getting
      income deserve fiscal encouragement, and how may economic surpluses
      best be tapped to
      support government needs? </small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Policies
      that subsidize <span style="font-style: italic;">rentier </span>incomes
