Do you question the relationship between taxation and righteousness?
Let us see. If government is a natural growth, then surely God's
natural law provides food and sustenance for government as that food is
needed; for where in Nature do we find a creature coming into the world
without timely provision of natural food for it? It is in our system of
taxation that we find the most emphatic denial of the Fatherhood of God
and the Brotherhood of Man, because, first, in order to meet our common
needs, we take from individuals what does not belong to us in common;
second, we permit individuals to take for themselves what does belong
to us in common; thus, third, under the pretext of taxation for public
purposes, we have established a system that permits some men to tax
other men for private profit.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Does not that violate the natural, the divine law? Does it not
surely
beget wolfish greed on the one hand, and gaunt poverty on the other?
Does it not surely breed millionaires on one end of the social scale
and tramps on the other end? Has it not brought into civilization a
hell, of which the savage can have no conception? Could any better
system be devised for convincing men that God is the father of a few
and the stepfather of the many? Is not that destructive of the
sentiment of brotherhood? With such a condition, how is it possible for
men in masses to obey the new commandment, "that ye love one another"?
What could more surely thrust men apart? What could more surely divide
them into warring classes?</small><br>
<br>
<small>You say that you need money to train young men and fit them "to
carry
the Word to the heathen of foreign lands, and thus be instrumental in
dispelling the darkness that reigns among millions of our brethren in
other lands." That is a noble purpose. But what message would your
school give to these young men to take to the benighted brethren that
would stand a fire of questions from an intelligent heathen? Suppose,
for example, your school sends to some pagan country an intelligent
young man, who delivers his message; and suppose an intelligent man in
the audience asks these questions:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>
You come from America, when your religion has been taught for about 400
years, where every small village has one of your churches, and the
great cities have scores upon scores. Do all the people attend these
churches? Do your countrymen generally practice what you preach to us?
Does even a considerable minority practice it? Are your laws consistent
with or contrary to the religion you preach to us? Are your cities
clean morally in proportion to the number of churches they contain? Do
your courts administer Justice impartially between man and man, between
rich and poor? Is it as easy for a poor man as for a rich one to get
his rights in your courts?<br>
<br>
You have great and powerful millionaires. How did they get their money?
Have they more influence than the poor in your churches and in your
congress, your legislatures and courts? Do they, in dealing with their
employees, observe the moral law that "the laborer is worthy of his
hire"? Do they treat their hired laborers as brothers? Do they put
children to work who ought to be at play or at school?<br>
<br>
Do your churches protect when the militia is called out during a
strike, or do they forget at such times what Jesus said about the use
of the sword?<br>
<br>
After four centuries of teaching and preaching of your religion in your
country, has crime disappeared or diminished? Have you less use for
jails? Are fewer and fewer of your people driven into madhouses, and
have suicides decreased? Is there a larger proportion of crime amongst
Jews and infidels than among those who profess the Christian Religion?
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>What answers would your missionary return to these questions?
How would
you answer them?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I do not attack Christianity. The foregoing questions are not
intended
as criticism of the great moral code underlying Christianity, but as
criticism of the men who preach, but do not practice that code. My
contention is that the code of morals taught to the fishermen of
Galilee by the Carpenter of Nazareth is all-embracing and
all-sufficient for our social life.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I shall be glad to contribute to your theological school or to
any
other that gets down to the bedrock of that social and moral code,
accepts it in its fulness, and trains its students to teach and preach
it regardless of the raiment, the bank accounts, the social standing or
political position of the persons in the pews.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small>...
