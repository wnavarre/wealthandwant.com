<blockquote>
  <p>When we permit those who own land to privatize the economic value of their
      land, we permit them to feed at what should be our common food-source. In a
      country where property rights are highly prized and treated as nearly sacred,
      this may seem like blasphemy. But the land was not made for the landowners;
      we are all land creatures, and rely on the land just as surely as we rely on
      air and water. As population increases, and technological progress accelerates,
      and public spending on infrastructure continues, all the effects show up in
      land values. Why should some of us be able to charge his fellow human beings
      for access to land? </p>
  <p>It isn't that we shouldn't have to pay for the land we use; we should! But
      we should have the comfort of knowing that our payments for the land are
    going into the public till, as the fountain for future public spending, not
    into
      private or corporate pockets. And we should not have to pay twice &#8212;  first
      for the use of the land and then through income and sales taxes &#8212; for
      the services and infrastructure that makes the same sites more valuable
      next year!</p>
  <p>This may sound quite radical the first time you hear it, but sit with it
    a while, and you may find that it is a route &#8212; the route &#8212; to
    a more just and logically ordered society, to an economy in which all can
    thrive,
      to a country where we are all equal, and the next child born is accorded
    his due.</p>

  <p><strong>2. THE TWO KINDS OF DIRECT TAXATION</strong><br />
      <br />
    Direct taxes fall into two general classes: (1) Taxes that are levied upon
    men in proportion to their <em>ability to pay</em>, and (2) taxes that are
    levied in proportion to the <em>benefits received</em> by the tax-payer from
    the public. Income taxes are the principal ones of the first class, though
    probate and inheritance taxes would rank high. The single tax is the only
    important one of the second class.</p>
  <p> There should be no difficulty in choosing between the two. To tax in proportion
    to ability to pay, regardless of benefits received, is in accord with no
    principle of just government; it is a device of piracy. The single tax, therefore,
    as the only important tax in proportion to benefits, is the ideal tax.</p>
  <p> But here we encounter two plausible objections. One arises from the mistaken
    but common notion that men are not taxed in proportion to benefits unless
    they pay taxes upon every kind of property they own that comes under the
    protection of government; the other is founded in the assumption that it
    is impossible to measure the value of the public benefits that each individual
    enjoys. Though the first of these objections ostensibly accepts the doctrine
    of taxation according to benefits,12 yet, as it leads to attempts at taxation
    in proportion to wealth, it, like the other, is really a plea for the piratical
    doctrine of taxation according to ability to pay. The two objections stand
    or fall together.</p>
  <p>Let it once be perceived that the value of the service which government
    renders to each individual would be justly measured by the single tax, and
    neither objection would any longer have weight. We should then no more think
    of taxing people in proportion to their wealth or ability to pay, regardless
    of the benefits they receive from government than an honest merchant would
    think of charging his customers in proportion to their wealth or ability
    to pay, regardless of the value of the goods they bought of him.&quot; 13</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On another occasion he wrote:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The tax on land values is the most just and equal of all
    taxes. It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and
    valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they
    receive. It is the taking by the community, for the use of the
    community, of that value which is the creation of the community. It is
    the application of the common property to common uses (George, P&amp;P,
    421).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And yet, my friends, in the topsy-turvy world in which we live,
  this provided fund goes mainly into the pockets of speculators and
  monopolists, while the body politic meets its needs by extorting from
  individual producers the fruits of honest toil. If ever there were
  any doubt about the perversity of human nature, our present system of
  taxation is the proof! Everywhere about us, we see the ironic
  spectacle of the community penalizing the individual for his industry
  and initiative, and taking away from him a share of that which he
  produces, yet at the same time lavishing upon the non-producer
  undeserved windfalls which it &#8212; the community &#8212; produces.
  And, as Winston Churchill put it, the unearned increment, the
  socially-produced value of the land, is reaped by the speculator in
  exact proportion, not to the service, but to the disservice, done.
"The greater the injury to society, the greater the reward."</p>
  <p>We hear constantly a vast clamor against the abuse of welfare. I
  do not for a moment condone such abuse. Yet I ask you, who is the
  biggest swiller at the public trough?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is it the sluggard who refuses
    to seek work when there is work available? </li>
    <li>Is it the slattern who
    generates offspring solely for the sake of the allotment they
    command? </li>
    <li>Or is it the man &#8212; perhaps a civic leader and a pillar
    of his church &#8212; who sits back, and, with perfect propriety and
    respectability, collects thousands and maybe even millions of dollars
    in unearned increments created by the public, as his reward for
    withholding land from those who wish to put it to productive use. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Talk about free enterprise! This isn't free enterprise; this is a
  free ride.<br>
  <br>
  But if that same person were to improve his site &#8212; if he were
  to use it to beautify his neighborhood, or to provide goods for
  consumers and jobs for workers, or housing for his fellow townsmen
&#8212; instead of being treated as the public benefactor he had
  become, he would be fined as if he were a criminal, in the form of
  heavier taxes. What kind of justice is this, I ask you? How does it
  comport with the Divine Plan, or with the notion of human rights? <a href="../docs/Andelson_TEITL.html"><span
