  <p>If government's purpose is to protect us from others who would trample our
    rights, shouldn't it be protecting our right to equal opportunity? Shouldn't
    it be protecting our right to what we create? Shouldn't it be focused on
    protecting those at the bottom of our spectrum &#8212; not by giving them
    charity, but by protecting their genuine rights?</p>

  Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not
  Steal</a>&nbsp; (1887 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>"Thou shalt not steal." That
  means, of course, that we ourselves must not steal. But does it not
  also mean that we must not suffer anybody else to steal if we can help
  it?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>"Thou shalt not steal." Does it not also mean: "Thou shalt not
  suffer thyself or anybody else to be stolen from?" If it does, then we,
  all of us, rich and poor alike, are responsible for this social crime
  that produces poverty. Not merely the people who monopolize the land &#8212; they
  are not to blame above anyone else, but we who permit them to monopolize land
  are also parties to the theft.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The Christianity that ignores this social responsibility has
  really forgotten the teachings of Christ. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Where He in the Gospels speaks of the
  judgment, the question which is put to the people is never, "Did you
  praise me?" "Did you pray to me?" "Did you believe this or did you
  believe that?" It is only this: "What did you do to relieve distress;
  to abolish poverty?"</span> To those who are condemned, the Judge is
  represented as saying: "I was ahungered and ye gave me no meat, I was
  athirst and ye gave me no drink, I was sick and in prison and ye
  visited me not." Then they say, "Lord, Lord, when did we fail to do
  these things to thee?" The answer is: "Inasmuch as ye failed to do it
  to the least of these, so also did ye fail to do it unto me; depart
  into the place prepared for the devil and his angels."</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>On the other hand, what is said to the blessed is: "I was
  ahungered and ye gave me meat, I was thirsty and ye gave me drink, I
  was naked and ye clothed me, I was sick and in prison and ye visited
  me." And when they say: "Lord, Lord, when did we do these things to
  thee?" <span style="font-weight: bold;">The answer is: "Inasmuch as ye
  have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
  me."</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here is the essential spirit of
  Christianity. The essence of its teaching is not "Provide for your own
  body and save your own soul!" but "Do what you can to make this world a
  better world for all!" </span>It was a protest against the doctrine of "each for himself and the devil takes the hindermost!" It
  was the proclamation of a common fatherhood of God and a common brotherhood
  and
  sisterhood of men and women. This was why the rich and powerful, the
  high priests and the rulers persecuted Christianity with fire and
  sword. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It
  was not religion (what in so many of our churches today is called
  religion) that pagan Rome sought to tear out &#8212; it was the doctrine of
  the equality of human rights!</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
  <br>
  <small>Now imagine, when we men and women of today go before that awful
  bar, that there we should behold the spirits of those who in our time
  under this accursed social system were driven into crime; of those who
  were starved in body and mind; of those little children who, in this
  city of New York, are being sent out of the world by thousands when
  they have scarcely entered it &#8212; because they do not get food enough,
  nor air enough; because they are crowded together in these tenement
  districts under conditions in which all diseases rage and destroy.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Supposing we are confronted with those souls, what will it avail
  us to say that we individually were not responsible for their earthly
  conditions? What, in the spirit of the parable of Matthew, would be the
  reply from the Judgment seat? Would it not be: "I provided for them
  all. The earth that I made was broad enough to give them room. The
  materials that are placed in it were abundant enough for all their
  needs. Did you or did you not lift up your voice against the wrong that
  robbed them of their fair share in the provision made for all?"</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>"Thou shalt not steal!" It is theft, it is robbery that is
  producing poverty and disease and vice and crime among us. It is by
  virtue of laws that we uphold; and those who do not raise their voices
  against that crime, they are accessories. The standard has now been
  raised, the cross of the new crusade at last is lifted. Some of us,
  aye, many of us, have sworn in our hearts that we will never rest as
  long as we have life and strength until we expose and abolish that
  wrong. We have declared war upon it. Those who are not with us, let us
  count them against us. For us there will be no faltering, no
  compromise, no turning back until the end. ...&nbsp;<a

Alanna Hartzok: <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">Who
Would Jesus Tax?&nbsp; The Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax
Crusade</a></span><a href="../docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>What makes Hamill's work so compelling is her
    deep grasp of the Alabama tax code combined with her thorough documentation
    of the scriptural bases for economic justice. She quotes chapters and verses
    which proclaim that the poor should not be oppressed and that society should
    create conditions for their advance. Among her favorites are Jesus' words
    in Matthew 25:45: "Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these,
    you did not do for me." Luke 16:19-31 is a parable of a rich man sent to
    hell because of his indifference to the disadvantaged and
in Jeremiah 22:15-16, "He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all
went well." </p>
