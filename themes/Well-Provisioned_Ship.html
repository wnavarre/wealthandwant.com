Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever

through the material universe could be utilized only through land.

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p><strong>2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.</strong>    (6-7.)</p>
  <p>In the second place your Holiness argues that man possessing reason and
    forethought may not only acquire ownership of the fruits of the earth, but
    also of the earth itself, so that out of its products he may make provision
    for the future.</p>
  <p>Reason, with its attendant forethought, is indeed the distinguishing attribute
    of man; that which raises him above the brute, and shows, as the Scriptures
    declare, that he is created in the likeness of God. And this gift of reason
    does, as your Holiness points out, involve the need and right of private
    property in whatever is produced by the exertion of reason and its attendant
    forethought, as well as in what is produced by physical labor. In truth,
    these elements of man&#8217;s production are inseparable, and labor involves
    the use of reason. It is by his reason that man differs from the animals
    in being a producer, and in this sense a maker. Of themselves his physical
    powers are slight, forming as it were but the connection by which the mind
    takes hold of material things, so as to utilize to its will the matter and
    forces of nature. It is mind, the intelligent reason, that is the prime mover
    in labor, the essential agent in production.</p>
  <p>The right of private ownership does therefore indisputably attach to things
    provided by man&#8217;s reason and forethought. But it cannot attach to things
    provided by the reason and forethought of God!</p>
  <p>To illustrate: Let us suppose a company traveling through the desert as
    the Israelites traveled from Egypt. Such of them as had the forethought to
    provide themselves with vessels of water would acquire a just right of property
    in the water so carried, and in the thirst of the waterless desert those
    who had neglected to provide themselves, though they might ask water from
    the provident in charity, could not demand it in right. For while water itself
    is of the providence of God, the presence of this water in such vessels,
    at such place, results from the providence of the men who carried it. Thus
    they have to it an exclusive right.</p>
  <p>But suppose others use their forethought in pushing ahead and appropriating
    the springs, refusing when their fellows come up to let them drink of the
    water save as they buy it of them. Would such forethought give any right?</p>
  <p>Your Holiness, it is not the forethought of carrying water where it is needed,
    but the forethought of seizing springs, that you seek to defend in defending
    the private ownership of land!</p>
  <p>Let me show this more fully, since it may be worth while to meet those who
    say that if private property in land be not just, then private property in
    the products of labor is not just, as the material of these products is taken
    from land. It will be seen on consideration that all of man&#8217;s production
    is analogous to such transportation of water as we have supposed. In growing
    grain, or smelting metals, or building houses, or weaving cloth, or doing
    any of the things that constitute producing, all that man does is to change
    in place or form preexisting matter. As a producer man is merely a changer,
    not a creator; God alone creates. And since the changes in which man&#8217;s
    production consists inhere in matter so long as they persist, the right of
    private ownership attaches the accident to the essence, and gives the right
    of ownership in that natural material in which the labor of production is
    embodied. Thus water, which in its original form and place is the common
    gift of God to all men, when drawn from its natural reservoir and brought
    into the desert, passes rightfully into the ownership of the individual who
    by changing its place has produced it there.</p>
  <p><strong>But such right of ownership is in reality a mere right of temporary
      possession. For though man may take material from the storehouse of nature
      and change
    it in place or form to suit his desires, yet from the moment he takes it,
    it tends back to that storehouse again. Wood decays, iron rusts, stone disintegrates
    and is displaced, while of more perishable products, some will last for only
    a few months, others for only a few days, and some disappear immediately
    on use. </strong>Though, so far as we can see, matter is eternal and force forever
    persists; though we can neither annihilate nor create the tiniest mote that
    floats in a sunbeam or the faintest impulse that stirs a leaf, yet in the
    ceaseless flux of nature, man&#8217;s work of moving and combining constantly
    passes away. Thus the recognition of the ownership of what natural material
    is embodied in the products of man never constitutes more than temporary
    possession &#8212; never interferes with the reservoir provided for all.
    As taking water from one place and carrying it to another place by no means
    lessens the store of water, since whether it is drunk or spilled or left
    to evaporate, it must return again to the natural reservoirs &#8212; so is
    it with all things on which man in production can lay the impress of his
    labor.</p>
  <p>Hence, when you say that man&#8217;s reason puts it within his right to
    have in stable and permanent possession not only things that perish in the
    using, but also those that remain for use in the future, you are right in
    so far as you may include such things as buildings, which with repair will
    last for generations, with such things as food or fire-wood, which are destroyed
    in the use. But when you infer that man can have private ownership in those
    permanent things of nature that are the reservoirs from which all must draw,
    you are clearly wrong. Man may indeed hold in private ownership the fruits
    of the earth produced by his labor, since they lose in time the impress of
    that labor, and pass again into the natural reservoirs from which they were
    taken, and thus the ownership of them by one works no injury to others. But
    he cannot so own the earth itself, for that is the reservoir from which must
    constantly be drawn not only the material with which alone men can produce,
    but even their very bodies.</p>
  <p>The conclusive reason why man cannot claim ownership in the earth itself
    as he can in the fruits that he by labor brings forth from it, is in the
    facts stated by you in the very next paragraph (7), when you truly say:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Man&#8217;s needs do not die out, but recur; satisfied today, they
          demand new supplies tomorrow. Nature, therefore, owes to man a storehouse
          that shall
        never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds only in
        the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By man you mean all men. Can what nature owes to all men be made the private
    property of some men, from which they may debar all other men?</p>
  <p><strong>Let me dwell on the words of your Holiness, &#8220;Nature, therefore, owes
    to man a storehouse that shall never fail.&#8221; By Nature you mean God.
    Thus your thought, that in creating us, God himself has incurred an obligation
    to provide us with a storehouse that shall never fail, is the same as is
    thus expressed and carried to its irresistible conclusion</strong> by the Bishop of
    Meath:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but having created
        us he bound himself by that act to provide us with the means necessary
      for our subsistence. The land is the only source of this kind now known
      to us.
        The land, therefore, of every country is the common property of the people
        of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who made it, has
      transferred it as a voluntary gift to them. &#8220;<em>Terram autem dedit
      filiis hominum</em>.&#8221; Now,
        as every individual in that country is a creature and child of God, and
      as all his creatures are equal in his sight, any settlement of the land
      of a
        country that would exclude the humblest man in that country from his
      share of the common inheritance would be not only an injustice and a wrong
      to that
        man, but, moreover, be AN IMPIOUS RESISTANCE TO THE BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS
        OF HIS CREATOR. ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    <strong>6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private
    property in land is necessary to enable them to do so.</strong> (14-17.)</p>
  <p>With all that your Holiness has to say of the sacredness of the family relation
    we are in full accord. But how the obligation of the father to the child
    can justify private property in land we cannot see. You reason that private
    property in land is necessary to the discharge of the duty of the father,
    and is therefore requisite and just, because &#8212;</p>
  <p>It is a most sacred law of nature that a father must provide food and all
    necessaries for those whom he has begotten; and, similarly, nature dictates
    that a man&#8217;s children, who carry on, as it were, and continue his own
    personality, should be provided by him with all that is needful to enable
    them honorably to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life. Now, in no other way can a father effect this except
    by the ownership of profitable property, which he can transmit to his children
    by inheritance. (14.)</p>
  <p>Thanks to Him who has bound the generations of men together by a provision
    that brings the tenderest love to greet our entrance into the world and soothes
    our exit with filial piety, it is both the duty and the joy of the father
    to care for the child till its powers mature, and afterwards in the natural
    order it becomes the duty and privilege of the child to be the stay of the
    parent. This is the natural reason for that relation of marriage, the groundwork
    of the sweetest, tenderest and purest of human joys, which the Catholic Church
    has guarded with such unremitting vigilance.</p>
  <p>We do, for a few years, need the providence of our fathers after the flesh.
    But how small, how transient, how narrow is this need, as compared with our
    constant need for the providence of Him in whom we live, move and have our
    being &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven! It is to him, &#8220;the giver
    of every good and perfect gift,&#8221; and not to our fathers after the flesh,
    that Christ taught us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; <strong>And
    how true it is that it is through him that the generations of men exist!
    Let the mean temperature of the earth rise or fall a few degrees, an amount
    as nothing compared with differences produced in our laboratories, and mankind
    would disappear as ice disappears under a tropical sun, would fall as the
    leaves fall at the touch of frost. Or, let for two or three seasons the earth
    refuse her increase, and how many of our millions would remain alive?</strong></p>
  <p>The duty of fathers to transmit to their children profitable property that
    will enable them to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life! What is not possible cannot be a duty. And how is it
    possible for fathers to do that? Your Holiness has not considered how mankind
    really lives from hand to mouth, getting each day its daily bread; how little
    one generation does or can leave another. It is doubtful if the wealth of
    the civilized world all told amounts to anything like as much as one year&#8217;s
    labor, while it is certain that if labor were to stop and men had to rely
    on existing accumulation, it would be only a few days ere in the richest
    countries pestilence and famine would stalk.</p>
  <p>      The profitable property your Holiness refers to, is private property in
        land. Now profitable land, as all economists will agree, is land superior
        to the
      land that the ordinary man can get. It is land that will yield an income
      to the owner as owner, and therefore that will permit the owner to appropriate
      the products of labor without doing labor, its profitableness to the individual
      involving the robbery of other individuals. It is therefore possible only
      for some fathers to leave their children profitable land. What therefore
      your Holiness practically declares is, that it is the duty of all fathers
      to struggle to leave their children what only the few peculiarly strong,
      lucky or unscrupulous can leave; and that, a something that involves the
      robbery of others &#8212; their deprivation of the material gifts of God.</p>
  <p>This anti-Christian doctrine has been long in practice throughout the Christian
    world. What are its results?</p>
  <p>Are they not the very evils set forth in your Encyclical? Are they not,
    so far from enabling men to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life, to condemn the great masses of men to want and misery
    that the natural conditions of our mortal life do not entail; to want and
    misery deeper and more wide-spread than exist among heathen savages? Under
    the r&eacute;gime of private property in land and in the richest countries
    not five per cent of fathers are able at their death to leave anything substantial
    to their children, and probably a large majority do not leave enough to bury
    them! Some few children are left by their fathers richer than it is good
    for them to be, but the vast majority not only are left nothing by their
    fathers, but by the system that makes land private property are deprived
    of the bounty of their Heavenly Father; are compelled to sue others for permission
    to live and to work, and to toil all their lives for a pittance that often
    does not enable them to escape starvation and pauperism.</p>
  <p>What your Holiness is actually, though of course inadvertently, urging,
    is that earthly fathers should assume the functions of the Heavenly Father.
    It is not the business of one generation to provide the succeeding generation &#8220;with
    all that is needful to enable them honorably to keep themselves from want
    and misery.&#8221; That is God&#8217;s business. We no more create our children
    than we create our fathers. It is God who is the Creator of each succeeding
    generation as fully as of the one that preceded it. <strong>And, to recall
    your own words (7), &#8220;Nature [God], therefore, owes to man a storehouse that
    shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds
    only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; What you are now
    assuming is, that it is the duty of men to provide for the wants of their
    children by appropriating this storehouse and depriving other men&#8217;s
    children of the unfailing supply that God has provided for all.</strong></p>
  <p>The duty of the father to the child &#8212; the duty possible to all fathers!
    Is it not so to conduct himself, so to nurture and teach it, that it shall
    come to manhood with a sound body, well-developed mind, habits of virtue,
    piety and industry, and in a state of society that shall give it and all
    others free access to the bounty of God, the providence of the All-Father?</p>
  <p>In doing this the father would be doing more to secure his children from
    want and misery than is possible now to the richest of fathers &#8212; as
    much more as the providence of God surpasses that of man. For the justice
    of God laughs at the efforts of men to circumvent it, and the subtle law
    that binds humanity together poisons the rich in the sufferings of the poor.
    Even the few who are able in the general struggle to leave their children
    wealth that they fondly think will keep them from want and misery in the
    uncertainties of this mortal life &#8212; do they succeed? Does experience
    show that it is a benefit to a child to place him above his fellows and enable
    him to think God&#8217;s law of labor is not for him? Is not such wealth
    oftener a curse than a blessing, and does not its expectation often destroy
    filial love and bring dissensions and heartburnings into families? And how
    far and how long are even the richest and strongest able to exempt their
    children from the common lot? Nothing is more certain than that the blood
    of the masters of the world flows today in lazzaroni and that the descendants
    of kings and princes tenant slums and workhouses.</p>
  <p>But in the state of society we strive for, where the monopoly and waste
    of God&#8217;s bounty would be done away with and the fruits of labor would
    go to the laborer, it would be within the ability of all to make more than
    a comfortable living with reasonable labor. And for those who might be crippled
    or incapacitated, or deprived of their natural protectors and breadwinners,
    the most ample provision could be made out of that great and increasing fund
    with which God in his law of rent has provided society &#8212; not as a matter
    of niggardly and degrading alms, but as a matter of right, as the assurance
    which in a Christian state society owes to all its members.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the duty of the father, the obligation to the child, instead
    of giving any support to private property in land, utterly condemns it, urging
    us by the most powerful considerations to abolish it in the simple and efficacious
    way of the single tax.</p>
  <p>This duty of the father, this obligation to children, is not confined to
    those who have actually children of their own, but rests on all of us who
    have come to the powers and responsibilities of manhood.</p>
  <p>For did not Christ set a little child in the midst of the disciples, saying
    to them that the angels of such little ones always behold the face of his
    Father; saying to them that it were better for a man to hang a millstone
    about his neck and plunge into the uttermost depths of the sea than to injure
    such a little one?</p>
  <p>And what today is the result of private property in land in the richest
    of so-called Christian countries? Is it not that young people fear to marry;
    that married people fear to have children; that children are driven out of
    life from sheer want of proper nourishment and care, or compelled to toil
    when they ought to be at school or at play; that great numbers of those who
    attain maturity enter it with under-nourished bodies, overstrained nerves,
    undeveloped minds &#8212; under conditions that foredoom them, not merely
    to suffering, but to crime; that fit them in advance for the prison and the
    brothel?</p>
  <p>If your Holiness will consider these things we are confident that instead
    of defending private property in land you will condemn it with anathema!
    <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    And it is because that in what we propose &#8212; the securing to all men
    of equal natural opportunities for the exercise of their powers and the removal
    of all legal restriction on the legitimate exercise of those powers &#8212; we
    see the conformation of human law to the moral law, that we hold with confidence
    that this is not merely the sufficient remedy for all the evils you so strikingly
    portray, but that it is the only possible remedy.</p>
  <p>Nor is there any other. The organization of man is such, his relations to
    the world in which he is placed are such &#8212; that is to say, the immutable
    laws of God are such, that it is beyond the power of human ingenuity to devise
    any way by which the evils born of the injustice that robs men of their birthright
    can be removed otherwise than by doing justice, by opening to all the bounty
    that God has provided for all.</p>
  <p>Since man can live only on land and from land, since land is the reservoir
    of matter and force from which man&#8217;s body itself is taken, and on which
    he must draw for all that he can produce, does it not irresistibly follow
    that to give the land in ownership to some men and to deny to others all
    right to it is to divide mankind into the rich and the poor, the privileged
    and the helpless? Does it not follow that those who have no rights to the
    use of land can live only by selling their power to labor to those who own
    the land? Does it not follow that what the socialists call &#8220;the iron
    law of wages,&#8221; what the political economists term &#8220;the tendency
    of wages to a minimum,&#8221; must take from the landless masses &#8212; the
    mere laborers, who of themselves have no power to use their labor &#8212; all
    the benefits of any possible advance or improvement that does not alter this
    unjust division of land? For having no power to employ themselves, they must,
    either as labor-sellers or as land-renters, compete with one another for
    permission to labor. This competition with one another of men shut out from
    God&#8217;s inexhaustible storehouse has no limit but starvation, and must
    ultimately force wages to their lowest point, the point at which life can
    just be maintained and reproduction carried on. ...</p>
  <p>The explanation of this and of similar paradoxes that in our time perplex
    on every side may be easily seen. The effect of all inventions and improvements
    that increase productive power, that save waste and economize effort, is
    to lessen the labor required for a given result, and thus to save labor,
    so that we speak of them as labor-saving inventions or improvements. Now,
    in a natural state of society where the rights of all to the use of the earth
    are acknowledged, labor-saving improvements might go to the very utmost that
    can be imagined without lessening the demand for men, since in such natural
    conditions the demand for men lies in their own enjoyment of life and the
    strong instincts that the Creator has implanted in the human breast. But
    in that unnatural state of society where the masses of men are disinherited
    of all but the power to labor when opportunity to labor is given them by
    others, there the demand for them becomes simply the demand for their services
    by those who hold this opportunity, and man himself becomes a commodity.
    Hence, although the natural effect of labor-saving improvement is to increase
    wages, yet in the unnatural condition which private ownership of the land
    begets, the effect, even of such moral improvements as the disbandment of
    armies and the saving of the labor that vice entails, is, by lessening the
    commercial demand, to lower wages and reduce mere laborers to starvation
    or pauperism. If labor-saving inventions and improvements could be carried
    to the very abolition of the necessity for labor, what would be the result?
    Would it not be that landowners could then get all the wealth that the land
    was capable of producing, and would have no need at all for laborers, who
    must then either starve or live as pensioners on the bounty of the landowners?</p>
  <p>Thus, so long as private property in land continues &#8212; so long as some
    men are treated as owners of the earth and other men can live on it only
    by their sufferance &#8212; human wisdom can devise no means by which the
    evils of our present condition may be avoided.</p>
  <p>Nor yet could the wisdom of God.</p>
  <p>By the light of that right reason of which St. Thomas speaks we may see
    that even he, the Almighty, so long as his laws remain what they are, could
    do nothing to prevent poverty and starvation while property in land continues.</p>
  <p>How could he? Should he infuse new vigor into the sunlight, new virtue into
    the air, new fertility into the soil, would not all this new bounty go to
    the owners of the land, and work not benefit, but rather injury, to mere
    laborers? Should he open the minds of men to the possibilities of new substances,
    new adjustments, new powers, could this do any more to relieve poverty than
    steam, electricity and all the numberless discoveries and inventions of our
    time have done? <strong>Or, if he were to send down from the heavens above
    or cause to gush up from the subterranean depths, food, clothing, all the
    things that
    satisfy man&#8217;s material desires, to whom under our laws would all these
    belong? </strong>So far from benefiting man, would not this increase and
    extension of his bounty prove but a curse, enabling the privileged class
    more riotously
    to roll in wealth, and bringing the disinherited class to more wide-spread
    starvation or pauperism. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>In the Encyclical however you commend the application to the ordinary relations
    of life, under normal conditions, of principles that in ethics are only to
    be tolerated under extraordinary conditions. You are driven to this assertion
    of false rights by your denial of true rights. <strong>The natural right
    which each man has is not that of demanding employment or wages from another
    man; but
    that of employing himself &#8212; that of applying by his own labor to the
    inexhaustible storehouse which the Creator has in the land provided for all
    men. Were that storehouse open, as by the single tax we would open it, the
    natural demand for labor would keep pace with the supply, the man who sold
    labor and the man who bought it would become free exchangers for mutual advantage,
    and all cause for dispute between workman and employer would be gone.</strong> For
    then, all being free to employ themselves, the mere opportunity to labor
    would cease to seem a boon; and since no one would work for another for less,
    all things considered, than he could earn by working for himself, wages would
    necessarily rise to their full value, and the relations of workman and employer
    be regulated by mutual interest and convenience.</p>
  <p>This is the only way in which they can be satisfactorily regulated.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness seems to assume that there is some just rate of wages that
    employers ought to be willing to pay and that laborers should be content
    to receive, and to imagine that if this were secured there would be an end
    of strife. This rate you evidently think of as that which will give working-men
    a frugal living, and perhaps enable them by hard work and strict economy
    to lay by a little something.</p>
  <p>But how can a just rate of wages be fixed without the &#8220;higgling of
    the market&#8221; any more than the just price of corn or pigs or ships or
    paintings can be so fixed? And would not arbitrary regulation in the one
    case as in the other check that interplay that most effectively promotes
    the economical adjustment of productive forces? Why should buyers of labor,
    any more than buyers of commodities, be called on to pay higher prices than
    in a free market they are compelled to pay? Why should the sellers of labor
    be content with anything less than in a free market they can obtain? Why
    should working-men be content with frugal fare when the world is so rich?
    Why should they be satisfied with a lifetime of toil and stinting, when the
    world is so beautiful? Why should not they also desire to gratify the higher
    instincts, the finer tastes? Why should they be forever content to travel
    in the steerage when others find the cabin more enjoyable? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong>And thus that pseudo-charity that discards and denies justice works
      evil. On the one side, it demoralizes its recipients, outraging that human
      dignity
    which as you say &#8220;God himself treats with reverence,&#8221; and turning
    into beggars and paupers men who to become self-supporting, self-respecting
    citizens need only the restitution of what God has given them. </strong>On the other
    side, it acts as an anodyne to the consciences of those who are living on
    the robbery of their fellows, and fosters that moral delusion and spiritual
    pride that Christ doubtless had in mind when he said it was easier for a
    camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the
    Kingdom of Heaven. For it leads men steeped in injustice, and using their
    money and their influence to bolster up injustice, to think that in giving
    alms they are doing something more than their duty toward man and deserve
    to be very well thought of by God, and in a vague way to attribute to their
    own goodness what really belongs to God&#8217;s goodness. For consider: Who
    is the All-Provider? Who is it that as you say, &#8220;owes to man a storehouse
    that shall never fail,&#8221; and which &#8220;he finds only in the inexhaustible
    fertility of the earth.&#8221; Is it not God? And when, therefore, men, deprived
    of the bounty of their God, are made dependent on the bounty of their fellow-creatures,
    are not these creatures, as it were, put in the place of God, to take credit
    to themselves for paying obligations that you yourself say God owes?... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

      Justice</small></small></a>&nbsp; (1982)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our problem today, as yesterday,
and the days before, back to the
earliest recorded times, is POVERTY. ... <br>
... Let us begin this study of the likely causes of our troubles by
asking two questions: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are we over-populated? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are the earth's
resources inadequate for this population? 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our stage, of course, for
making this study will be this world of ours, for it is upon this
world that the drama of human living is played out, with all its joys
and all its sorrows, with all its great achievements and all its
failures, with all its nobilities and all its wickedness.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Regardless of its size relative to
other planets, with its
circumference of about twenty-five thousand miles, to any mere mortal
who must walk to the station and back each day, it is huge. Roughly
ninety-six million miles separate the sun from the earth on the
latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this distance, the
earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and it spins
on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's rays are
distributed far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage and
maximizing their benefits.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider the complementarity of
nature in the case of the two
forms of life we call vegetable and animal, in their respective uses
of the two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, the waste product of
each serving as the life-giving force of the other. Any increase in
the one will encourage a like response in the other.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marvel at the manner in which
nature, with no help from man or
beast, delivers pure water to the highest lands, increasing it as to
their elevation, thus affording us a free ride downstream and free
power as we desire it. Look with awe at the variety and quantity of
minerals with which this world is blessed, and finally at the
fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both animal and
vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels from a single
stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of this year's
crop; then think of the vastly greater yields from a single cherry
pit or the seeds of a single apple, or grape or watermelon; or,
turning to the animal world, consider the hen who averages almost an
egg a day and the spawning fish as examples of the prolificacy that
is evident throughout the whole of the animal world, including
mankind.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If this marvelous earth is as rich
in resources as portrayed in
the foregoing paragraph, then the problem must be one of
distribution: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>how is the land distributed among the earth's
inhabitants, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>how are its products in turn distributed?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land is universally treated as
either public property or private
property. Wars are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated as common
property.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George has described this world as
a "well-provisioned ship" and
when one considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals of such
provisions as coal and petroleum as have occurred say over the past
one hundred years, one must but agree with this writer. But this is
only a static view. Consider the suggestion of some ten years ago
that it would require the conversion of less than 20% the of the
current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the motors
then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The dynamic picture
of the future is indeed awesome, and there is every indication that
that characteristic has the potential of endless expansion. <b>So how
is it that on so richly endowed a Garden of Eden as this world of
ours we have only been able to make of it a hell on earth for vast
numbers of people?</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The answers are simple: we have
permitted, nay we have even more
than that, encouraged, the gross misallocation of resources and a
viciously wicked distribution of wealth, and we choose to be governed
by those whom we, in our ignorance, have elected. ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p> THAT man cannot exhaust or lessen the powers of nature follows from the
    indestructibility of matter and the persistence of force. Production and
    consumption are only relative terms. Speaking absolutely, man neither produces
    nor consumes. The whole human race, were they to labor to infinity, could
    not make this rolling sphere one atom heavier or one atom lighter, could
    not add to or diminish by one iota the sum of the forces whose everlasting
    circling produces all motion and sustains all life. As the water that we
    take from the ocean must again return to the ocean, so the food we take from
    the reservoirs of nature is, from the moment we take it, on its way back
    to those reservoirs. What we draw from a limited extent of land may temporarily
    reduce the productiveness of that land, because the return may be to other
    land, or may be divided between that land and other land, or perhaps, all
    land ; but this possibility lessens with increasing area, and ceases when
    the whole globe is considered. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    II, Chapter 3: Population and Subsistence: Inferences from Analogy</p>
  <p>LIFE does not use up the forces that maintain life. We come into the material
    universe bringing nothing; we take nothing away when we depart. The human
    being, physically considered, is but a transient form of matter, a changing
    mode of motion. The matter remains and the force persists. Nothing is lessened,
    nothing is weakened. And from this it follows that the limit to the population
    of the globe can only be the limit of space. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    II, Chapter 3: Population and Subsistence: Inferences from Analogy</p>
  <p> I BELIEVE that in a really Christian community, in a society that honored,
    not with the lips but with the act, the doctrines of Jesus, no one would
    have occasion to worry about physical needs any more than do the lilies of
    the field. There is enough and to spare. The trouble is that, in this mad
    struggle, we trample in the mire what has been provided in sufficiency for
    us all; trample it in the mire while we tear and rend each other. &#8212; The
    Crime of Poverty</p>
  <p>WHOSE fault is it that social conditions are such that men have to make
    that terrible choice between what conscience tells them is right, and the
    necessity of earning a living? I hold that it is the fault of society; that
    it is the fault of us all. Pestilence is a curse. The man who would bring
    cholera to this country, or the man who, having the power to prevent its
    coming here, would make no effort to do so, would be guilty of a crime. Poverty
    is worse than cholera; poverty kills more people than pestilence, even in
    the best of times. Look at the death statistics of our cities; see where
    the deaths come quickest; see where it is that the little children die like
    flies &#8212; it is in the poorer quarters. And the man who looks with careless
    eyes upon the ravages of this pestilence; the man who does not set himself
    to stay and eradicate it, he, I say, is guilty of a crime. &#8212; The Crime
    of Poverty</p>
  <p>SOCIAL progress makes the well-being of all more and more the business of
    each; it binds all closer and closer together in bonds from which none can
    escape. He who observes the law and the proprieties, and cares for his family,
    yet takes no interest in the general weal, and gives no thought to those
    who are trodden underfoot, save now and then to bestow alms, is not a true
    Christian. Nor is he a good citizen. &#8212; Social Problems &#8212; Chapter
    1, the Increasing Importance of Social Questions</p>
  <p>WE cannot safely leave politics to politicians, or political economy to
    college professors. The people themselves must think, because the people
    alone can act. &#8212; Social Problems &#8212; Chapter 1, the Increasing
    Importance of Social Questions </p>
  <p>NOW, why is it that men, have to work for such low wages? Because, if they
    were to demand higher wages, there are plenty of unemployed men ready to
    step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed men who compel that
    fierce competition that drives wages down to the point of bare subsistence.
    Why is it that there are men who cannot get employment? Did you ever think
    what a strange thing it is that men cannot find employment? If men cannot
    find an employer, why can they not employ themselves? Simply because they
    are shut out from the element on which human labor can alone be exerted;
    men are compelled to compete with each other for the wages of an employer,
    because they have been robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves;
    because they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
    paying some other human creature for the privilege. &#8212; The Crime of
    Poverty</p>
  <p>WE laud as public benefactors those who, as we say, &quot;furnish employment.&quot; We
    are constantly talking as though this &quot;furnishing of employment,&quot; this &quot;giving
    of work&quot; were the greatest boon that could be conferred upon society.
    To listen to much that is talked and much that is written, one would think
    that the cause of poverty is that there is not work enough for so many people,
    and that if the Creator had made the rock harder, the soil less fertile,
    iron as scarce as gold, and gold as diamonds; or if ships would sink and
    cities burn down oftener, there would be less poverty, because there would
    be more work to do. &#8212; Social Problems, Chapter 8 &#8212; That We All
    Might Be Rich</p>
  <p>YOU assert the right of laborers to employment and their right to receive
    from their employers a certain indefinite wage. No such rights exist. No
    one has a right to demand employment of another, or to demand higher wages
    than the other is willing to give, or in any way to put pressure on another
    to make him raise such wages against his will. There can be no better moral
    justification for such demands on employers by working-men than there would
    be for employers demanding that working-men shall be compelled to work for
    them when they do not want to, and to accept wages lower than they are willing
    to take. &#8212; The Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII </p>
  <p>THE natural right which each man has, is not that of demanding employment
    or wages from another man, but that of employing himself &#8212; that of
    applying by his own labor to the inexhaustible storehouse which the Creator
    has in the land provided for all men. Were that storehouse open, as by the
    single tax we would open it, the natural demand for labor would keep pace
    with the supply, the man who sold labor and the man who bought it would become
    free exchangers for mutual advantage, and all cause for dispute between workman
    and employer would be gone. For then, all being free to employ themselves,
    the mere opportunity to labor would cease to seem a boon; and since no one
    would work for another for less, all things considered, than he could earn
    by working for himself, wages would necessarily rise to their full value,
    and the relations of workman and employer be regulated by mutual interest
    and convenience. &#8212; The Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope Leo
    XIII </p>
  <p> IF we are all here by the equal permission of the Creator, we are all here
    with an equal title to the enjoyment of His bounty &#8212; with an equal
    right to the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This is a right

    on an orb that whirls through space &#8212; our rights to take and possess
    cannot be exclusive; they must be bounded everywhere by the equal rights
    of others. Just as the passenger in a railroad car may spread himself and
    his baggage over as many seats as he pleases, until other passengers come
    in, so may a settler take and use as much land as he chooses, until it is
    needed by others &#8212; a fact which is shown by the land acquiring a value &#8212; when
    his right must be curtailed by the equal rights of the others, and no priority
    of appropriation can give a right which will bar these equal rights of others. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    VII, Chapter 1, Justice of the Remedy: Injustice of private property in land
