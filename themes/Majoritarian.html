Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_PJER.html">Peace, Justice
and Economic Reform</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a bumper sticker that
says, "If you want peace, then work
for justice." At a superficial level, this simple slogan contains an
important half-truth. At a deeper level, it contains a more profound
half-truth. To understand these half-truths and why they are only
half true, we need to know what peace is, what justice is, and we
need to understand the relationship between the two. So in this talk
I want to explore the meanings of peace and justice, their
relationship, and the role of economic reform in attaining both.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"If you want peace, then work for
justice." The more obvious and
superficial meaning of this slogan is that people who are treated
unjustly will prevent the attainment of peace until the wrongs to
which they are subject are righted. Demonstrators shout: "No justice.
No peace." The apparent meaning of peace in this case is tranquility,
the absence of strife. And if this meaning of peace is accepted, the
slogan is true. You cannot expect to end strife as long as people
have unresolved grievances. But the reason that this is only half
true is that this meaning is only a shadow of what peace really
is.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is more than armistice, more
than the cessation of violence.
Peace is unity and harmony. In a peaceful world people are all
pleased to cooperate with one another. When we have attained true
peace, there will be no person who has any purpose that any other
person seeks to thwart. In a peaceful world, everyone will feel the
truth of John Donne's meditation,</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>No man is an Island
entire of itself; every man is a
piece of the Continent; a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by
the sea, Europe is the less, and well as if a promontory were, as well
as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death
diminishes me because I am involved in Mankind; therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee</i>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[1]</span></small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it imaginable that we might
ever attain a world where everyone
felt so? And if we do so, what will be the role of justice in that
world? What is justice? 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are so many conflicting,
strident claims for different
conceptions of justice that a person might reasonably despair of ever
finding a meaning of justice that people would agree upon. Any
conception of justice may seem to be no more than one person's
opinion. And yet there are things that we all know about justice.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even the utilitarian proposal
that conflicting claims should be
settled in the way that yields the greatest possible utility must be
rejected as an elitist imposition of a particular goal on people who
may have other plans. If I choose to pursue a life that can be
guaranteed to lead to depression and despair, I have as much claim to
the protection of justice in that pursuit as if I choose the path
that leads to bliss. Justice must be neutral in its evaluation of
people and their goals. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we commit ourselves to
neutrality, does that provide a unique
definition of justice? No, it doesn't. There are a number of
definitions of justice that might claim to satisfy neutrality,
although the claims of some definitions are dubious, and other
definitions can be rejected on other grounds.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Consider first the <span style="font-weight: bold;">conservative </span>claim
that justice is defined by
traditional rules.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Next, consider the claim that justice is defined by what the
majority wants. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarian </span>says,
"If you want to know who
should prevail in a conflict, take a vote." As appealing as
majoritarianism may be on the surface, it cannot provide a coherent
theory of justice. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
If voting cannot be used to define justice, one might entertain
the possibility of using a <span style="font-weight: bold;">contractarian
</span>formulation: What is just is
the rules to which people would have agreed if they did not know
their personal circumstances.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a reasonable recipe for
implementing the Golden Rule and a
fine idea for seeking agreement about the principles by which
complaints shall be judged. If people were to follow this suggestion
and achieve the agreement that is described, they would achieve
fairness.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
However, this does not make Rawls's suggestion a good way to
identify justice.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, consider <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>. The egalitarian says
that justice
is equality. There is a conceptual difficulty in specifying how
beings as different from each other as humans are could ever be
equal, unless we create a society where all humans are female clones
of one another. (This should be technologically feasible within a few
decades, if it is not already.) But I do not think that egalitarians
want a society of clones.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
John Rawls has proposed that the talents that individuals possess
be regarded as a common pool, so that anyone who has more than his
share has an obligation to compensate those who have less then their
shares.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></small></small><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
</span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All of these suggestions should be
rejected. Talents are not a
common pool from which some persons have taken more then their
shares. If we are all fishing in the same pond, the quantity of fish
that you take will diminish the quantity that is available to me. But
the quantity of talent that you have in no way diminishes the
quantity that is available to me. Your talent is not acquired at my
expense.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the perspective of peace, no
man is an island; each of us is
a part of mankind. And any of us who has been graced with an extra
measure of talent should recognize that, often, the best use of our
talent is to provide for others. Nevertheless, from the perspective
of justice, each of us must be allowed to act like an island if he
wishes.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Suppose that a bone-marrow transplant from me would save your
life--or at least prolong it.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small>
If you do not mind requiring a bone-marrow transplant of me, then
what about a kidney?<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small>
If you do not mind requiring me to donate a kidney, then what
about my heart?&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>
A good egalitarian should require me to part with the one available
heart after I have had my share of years.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I don't think you would. I
don't think anyone would. We are
not egalitarians. We recognize the sanctity of the boundaries of the
human body. In a peaceful world I will gladly give a spare kidney to
anyone who needs it. But in a just world, no one will forcefully
extract a kidney from me, even to save someone else's life. Justice
is not egalitarianism.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Just as I own my kidneys, so do I own my talents. In a peaceful
world I will use them for the benefit of all mankind. But the sword
of justice should not be used to force me to compensate those with
less talent. Nor should it be used to force me to abide by the
insurance contract that you believe I would have signed, if I had had
the chance, before I knew what talents I would have.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A proper definition of justice
begins with the principles of
classical liberalism. In a just world each person is permitted to
determine the purposes to which his or her body is put--the hands and
the brain no less than the kidneys. We each have rights of
self-determination. This includes the right of ownership of what we
produce, at least, as John Locke said, when we leave as much in
natural opportunities for others as we appropriate for our own
productive activities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[11]</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have the right to co-operate
with whom we choose for whatever
mutually agreed purposes we choose. Thus we have the right to trade
with others, without any artificial hindrances, and we have the right
to keep any wages or interest that we receive from such trading.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the classical
liberal conception of justice
are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
issue of great importance: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">how
are claims of exclusive access to
natural opportunities to be established?
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
John Locke qualified his statement that we own what we produce
with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
there is plenty of unclaimed land.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span></small>
Locke does not address
the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.
One tradition in classical liberalism concerning claims to land is
that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>"&nbsp;
<strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>," as inspired if not
exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any excess
in one's claim
generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
There are two fundamental problems with the position of
homesteading libertarians on claims to land.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
with the position of the
homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
allocating land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
thing, as people stampeded to do
whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But the homesteading
libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
because I got here first," isn't justice.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Justice -- the balancing of the scales -- is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position, "I
get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
natural opportunities of equal value for you."&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Justice is thus a regime in which persons have the greatest
possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
reform -- the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
opportunities.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So if you want a peace for others,
then work for justice. Work for
freedom. Work for the elimination of all taxes on the productive
things that people do. Work for equality in the right to benefit from
natural opportunities. All these things will make it easier for
people to make the leap to peace.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
But if you want peace for yourself, simply have it.&nbsp; <a

Efficiency and Preventing Exploitation in Taxing and Spending Decisions</a></small></small></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Two of the most troublesome features of taxation and public spending are that
    taxation relies on coercion, and that the combination of taxing and public
    spending generates substantially haphazard redistribution. People must pay
    their taxes on penalty of having their property confiscated, or of going to
    jail. And we cannot say that this process is for everyone's good.</p>
  <p>There is reason to believe, though we do not have the basis to say for sure,
    that some people receive much less in benefits from public spending than they
    pay in taxes. How do we justify the harm that is thereby done to some persons
    by the combination of taxing and public spending? I would like to address this
    question by first discussing some possible justifications that might seem attractive,
    but should be rejected.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One possible justification is <span style="font-weight: bold;">conservatism</span>:
        Things have always been done this way. Our institutions have evolved to solve
        social problems that we may not even be aware of. Who knows what terrible
        things might happen if we did things differently?
          <p>There is an element of validity to the conservative position, but not
            an adequate basis for making conservatism the primary principle of social
            organization. If we had adopted conservatism as the primary principle
            of social organization centuries ago, there would have been no end to
            slavery, no women's suffrage, nor any of the numerous other changes in
            social organization in response to improvements in our moral understanding.
            It would be foolhardy to assert that we will never experience further
            improvements in our moral understanding that will call for changes in
            social organization.</p>
    </li>
    <li>A second possible justification of public spending is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarianism</span>: Once we have voted we know
        the right thing to do. The possibility of majority-rule cycles undermines
        the simple-minded version of majoritarianism that says that the majority
        is always right. Still, it would be possible to assert that majorities
      should have their way when cycles are not observed, and that when they
      are observed,
        some device for cutting through cycles can restore the viability of majoritarianism.
        However, that would give free rein to any majority to exploit any minority.
        That makes no sense as a theory of justice. One could assert that voters,
        acting as judges of what is best rather than as self-interested advocates,
        have a claim to determine in a majoritarian fashion what a collectivity
      ought to do. But then one still needs a theory of the principles by which
      the voters
        ought to judge. </li>
    <li>A third possible justification of public spending is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>: People should be required
          to provide as much for others as they have themselves. This theory
      suffers from the difficulties of vagueness and questionable operationality.
      As much
          what? There is no way to ensure that all persons will have equal quantities
          of such valued things as affection, talent or self-confidence. It is
      possible to imagine a crude egalitarianism of goods, but only by eliminating
      all incentives
          to be productive. If equality is traded off against some other goal,
      then egalitarianism is no longer the first principle.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rawls manages to retain the primacy of egalitarianism without destroying all
    incentives to be productive by the maximin rule: <b>Laws should be designed
    to maximize the well-being of the least advantaged person.</b> This formulation,
    however, generates such anomalies as the following: If there are three persons,
    and the choice is either a distribution of $10,000, $12,000 and $50,0000, or
    a distribution of $10,001, $10,002 and $80,000, the <i>maximin</i> rule will
    select the latter, despite the fact that it makes the middle income person,
    who is already relatively poor, even poorer while making the richest person
    noticeably richer. In Rawls's particular formulation there is a further difficulty.
    He makes the <i>maximin</i> rule lexically subordinate to the rule that all
    persons should have the maximum individual liberty that all can have. However,
    he does not deal with the following problem: My individual liberty will be
    unnecessarily restricted if I am not allowed to sing you a song in exchange
    for a haircut (without being taxed), but if I am allowed to do so without being
    taxed, the maximin rule is not satisfied. If Rawls really does mean to put
    individual liberty lexically first, no redistributive income taxes would be
    permitted. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read the whole article</a></p>
