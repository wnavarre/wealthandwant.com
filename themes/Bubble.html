&nbsp; Its cost to the economy</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Turning land-value
gains into capital gains</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">To benefit as
much as possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually a "land gain", that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
new entries into the </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Forbes</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> or </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>How land gets a
negative value!</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE DRIVING FORCE behind the
anomalies is the political lobbying
eager to depict real estate gains simply as "protecting capital from
inflation." In reality, it helps land owners and their creditors get
a free ride out of land asset-price inflation -- that is, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
Bubble. ...</span></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In sum, just as
real estate lending fuels land speculation, so the
withdrawal of such credit leaves property markets to decline,
sometimes with a crash, as occurred in Japan after 1990 when its
financial bubble burst. Should this rise and fall be attributed to
buildings or to land? It seems to me that inasmuch as the price rise
and fall is homogeneous, applying to parking lots as well as to
skyscrapers, we should attribute it to land. This achieves the
logical symmetry of applying to the downturns as well as upturns in
the real estate cycle.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One clear sign of land-price
inflation is that one category of
land rises or falls much more rapidly than others. A widening
disparity usually reflects a financial inflation. In Japan, for
instance, high rates of saving were recycled to a remarkable extent
into construction and real estate acquisition. Japanese authorities
produced detailed land-value statistics for each category of land,
showing property values during the Bubble years 1985-90 rising at an
accelerating pace until 1991, and then turning downward. The A-shaped
rise and fall was steepest for the most expensive land surrounding
the Tokyo palace, while land for single-story wooden residential
housing rose and fell least steeply. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A
land-value map placing the
highest values at the center and the lowest values in the outlying
areas would tend to reflect a land-price bubble when price ratios
steepened.</span> On the other hand, a fairly level set of land values
between the central city and its outskirts would indicate relatively
less rent of location, and hence less land-value disparities. Using
this analogy to examine New York City's midtown area, the steep
land-value curve has been fed by credit as affluent buyers sought the
most prestigious locations. Land sites have become the receptacle of
the economy's surplus savings.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Real estate
industry's priorities</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>REAL ESTATE LOBBIES recognize that
what is not seen is less likely
to be taxed. What is not quantified for public policy-makers to see
clearly may avoid taxes, leaving property owners with a larger
after-tax return. They prefer land-residual's capital gains
statistics at the national level, even as individual investors seek
site-value gains at the local level.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This explains the seeming irony
that investors in an industry
dealing primarily with the development of land sites have campaigned
to minimize the statistical treatment of land. Relegating land to
merely secondary status enables the real estate industry to depict
its "capital" gains as resulting from cost inflation and hence the
reproduction costs of buildings -- whose value is allowed to be
depreciated and re-depreciated at rising values over time. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The free
lunch of land-price gains is unseen as attention is diverted from the
real estate bubble and land-price inflation to building costs. These
fiscal considerations help to explain why it has been so hard to get
Washington to produce national land value statistics. ... 
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE
FREE LUNCH:</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Its cost to citizens</span></small><br>
<small>The recycling of savings into new mortgage lending has fueled an
economy-wide inflation of asset prices for land, homes, and commercial
properties, as well as stock market and bond prices. If what rises in
value is mainly the land site, then the property owners appear as
passive beneficiaries enjoying a free lunch. The property is their
major asset and the mortgage their major debt. While doing little to
increase the value of the building beyond having picked a good location
and making the normal maintenance, they ride the crest of asset-price
inflation of land . Indeed, take-home earnings have drifted down over
the past two decades, but house prices have soared.</small><br>
<br>
<small>These "capital gains" for households are part of the new
phenomenon that has been popularized as "labor capitalism." As Margaret
Thatcher's crowd has put it, "Sorry you've lost your job; I hope you've
made a killing on your Council House or home in the real estate
market." The free lunch.</small><br>
<br>
<small>For the two-thirds of America's and Britain's populations who
are home owners, this free lunch from asset-price inflation of land has
proved to be a silver lining in the post-industrial economy. For the
remaining third of the population, however, the price of access to home
ownership is receding rapidly. Today it hardly is possible for most
renters to earn the money to acquire their own homes. The entry price
has been bid up too high by those hoping to gain from asset-price
inflation even as labor's earnings have been declining.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Its cost to the economy</span></small><br>
<small>Once a building has taken all its depreciation, investors have a
tax motive to sell the property and buy another. The sales price
obviously will be higher if the new buyer can begin depreciating the
building all over again, for the property will yield more after-tax
revenue. This financial trick turns the real estate sector into a game
of musical chairs, while enabling property owners to avoid income
taxation. The end result is to free more of their cash flow to pledge
to mortgage lenders as interest, in exchange for loans to buy more and
more property that is rising in price. This is the anatomy of the
dramatic increase in land-prices, called the real estate bubble. The
tragedy of modern economies is this divergence of saving away from
financing new direct investment and employment, to inflate a financial
and real estate bubble. When the bubble bursts there will be little new
tangible wealth creation to show for it, only a wave of insolvency,
bankruptcy and foreclosures as the Western economies begin to look more
like that of Japan since its bubble burst a decade ago. America's and
Europe's largest economic expansion may similarly give way to a long
depression. Its cause will remain invisible as long as the politically
powerful real estate interests keep getting land undevalued and its
income masked as capital gains on the national income and product
accounts.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>SUMMARY</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For hundreds of years property's
value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental
stream will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more
years' rent a property will bring. What is so striking about land
values today is that they are rising for reasons independent of their
earnings stream. The major new consideration is their prospect for
future "capital" (that is, land-price) gains. In sum, the ultimate
aim of real estate investors no longer is so much to seek income --
most of which is pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the
property they acquire -- as much as to seek property gains.
Politically opportunites abound. <b>Merely changing zoning in New
York City in the 1980s to allow using commercial loft spaces for
residential purposes had the effect of multiplying asset values five
or tenfold.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether the gains come from
selling the property or from borrowing
more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
the strategies they developed over the past half century.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nationwide the capital-gains
dimension needs to be incorporated
into the rental revenue statistics to measure real estate's total
returns. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sector's
nearly complete success in escaping the tax
collector has placed an enormous tax burden on everyone else.</span></b></small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">What To Do About
the Real Estate Bubble</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What&#8217;s bubbling, and until when?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Sellers are happy. So are developers and speculators. Real estate has
gone all bubbly, and that bubble has gone ballistic. What goes up,
however, must soon do something else. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Actually, it&#8217;s not housing whose price has entered the
stratosphere. Buildings age &#8211; get older, more worn out. What&#8217;s getting
more valuable is the land, the location &#8211; whether it has a building on
it or not. Buildings you can make more of, but land you can not,
especially locations along the coasts or on the good side of town. None
of that would matter if you could ever get buildings to hover around in
the air. Meanwhile however, speculators are happy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... What&#8217;s seemingly good for landowners is not necessarily good
for the economy. As people spend more on land, something nobody
produced, they spend less on output, things people do produce. As
producers get less money spent on their products, eventually they take
the hint and produce less. "Produce less" is another way of spelling
recession.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Plus, more expensive land means heavier borrowing to buy it.
More debt means more inflation and less stability. When producers cut
back, borrowers have a much harder time paying back their debts. As
people go bankrupt, they drag others down with them. A collapsing house
of cards is another way of spelling depression.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preventing bubbles?</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If land values didn&#8217;t get
inflated, of
course they would not have to get deflated.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Call it mutual compensation for
deprivation from part of our common natural heritage. </span> While in
rhythmic
systems, prices must rise and fall, but they need not boom then bust;
they could climb then glide. What would temper economies, preventing
bubbles? Rather than let a few lucky owners collect land values,
neighbors would have to recover land values for themselves. Nobody made
land, and no lone owner made its value; the presence of society in
general did that. Plus, for excluding everyone else from their sites,
owners owe everyone else, as each one of us owes everyone for excluding
them. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To recover land value,
government
could either transform the property tax into a land tax or replace it
and other taxes with land dues or land use fees or an annual deed fee.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To pay the land dues, owners use their
land efficiently; owners who had been speculating get busy and develop.</span>
No longer allowed to tax anything that moves, local governments, too,
which presently let acres of abandoned urban land and buildings lie
fallow, get busy, too, and make sure to get those acres into the hands
of ambitious owners who&#8217;ll pay land dues. More locations put to use and
more buildings put up increases supply, which dampens price.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Better still, as government recovers
land rent, that leaves owners with less land rent to capitalize into
land price. Hence buyers need not borrow so much.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Land would still rise in value. With
every discovery of a nearby natural resource. With the opening of every
new bridge. With every techno-advance, as silicon wafers did for
Silicon Valley. With every jump in income and drop in crime, land value
rises. But no longer into a bubble. Because every rise would find its
way &#8211; via land dues and rent dividends &#8211; into everyone&#8217;s pockets. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
If the 18-year average holds for this cycle, then real estate still has
a few more years of sucking all the investments and purchasing power
out of the rest of the economy. Land is still able to soak it all up,
and lenders are still willing to pump more in. So despite the premature
panic (markets almost never do what everybody says they&#8217;re going to
do), Mankiw&#8217;s 2007 would be the earliest that the current bubble would
burst, and 2008 is just as likely.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Then land prices will fall for a few years. Since the run-up was steep,
the drop will be, too &#8211; after correcting for inflation, maybe as much
as 50%. Which will be an enormous relief for the economy &#8211; just what
the doctor ordered. With land affordable again, a new cycle can get
under way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether the new one will
be boom and bust or climb and glide is up to us, whether we&#8217;re willing
to practice geonomics, to forego taxes and subsidies in favor of land
dues and a Citizens Dividend.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While I don&#8217;t mind the current
gambling, I do mind the widening of the cavernous gulf between haves
and have-nots, and I boil over while workweek grows more onerous, and
just seethe watching vacant lots and abandoned buildings push
development out from urban cores to sprawl on suburban farmland. To
reverse that, let&#8217;s let go of the individual owner&#8217;s hold on land rent
and share Earth&#8217;s worth equitably among us all. We&#8217;ll all be glad we
did. </span>...<a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">&nbsp; <big><big><small><small><span

Henry George in <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>
(Bk V, Ch1) identified the
"speculative advance of land values" as the "great initiatory cause of
industrial depressions." Economic cycles can be linked to just about
every downturn over the course of two centuries, the more so as the
economy has come to be monetized. Frederick Lewis Allen, the great
journalist gives a compelling account of how the Florida land boom (and
later bust) antedated the Great Depression.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">68</span></small> More
recently a similar speculative bubble explains the Asian economic
crash, particularly in Thailand.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">69</span></small> When
the Japanese economy was at its peak, the value of land in Tokyo alone
exceeded that of the entire United States, and the appraised land value
under the Imperial Palace was as great as all the real estate in
California.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">70</span></small>
The most convincing study of the relationship between land value cycles
and more general economic cycles is one done for Australia by a
contemporary Georgist economist.<small><span

are some students of the American economy that believe that we are the

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PoICG.html">The Partiality of
Indexing Capital Gains</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We surely agree with Roberts et
al. that domestic capital
formation is a crying current need; and the means is to foster saving
and investing (but properly defined, as below). We also agree there
is a strong, bi-partisan case for raising investment flows of the
income-creating, work-activating kind. Here, however, we meet the
problem of distinguishing new capital from old assets, especially
land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
is not formed, like capital,
by saving and investment;
land is not reproducible. For that very reason land tends to
appreciate, and therefore has to be a major source of what are
misleadingly called "capital" gains.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Again for that
very reason,
there is no supply-side kick in untaxing gains. Most of them are land
gains, and should be called that.</span> To use land as a store of
value is
macro-economically unproductive at best, and on balance
counterproductive and destabilizing (considering its effect on
financial institutions like the S&amp;Ls).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To handle this matter we need two
semantic distinctions
which often are lost in the word-fencing of debate. Walter Heller,
whose policies still enjoy bi-partisan support, thought and spoke in
a Keynesian framework where "investment" means "investing," an
affirmative, job-making action. It is a process, not a store of
value; an economic flow, not a fund. It is not the asset held: this
"investment" is a noun, macro-economically static and sterile. [<i>Land
may appreciate, and one may call this "investment," but the
appreciation employs no one and creates no new wealth (although it may
reflect the externalities of wealth created by others).</i>]</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To

 style="font-style: italic;">[Webster's 9th New Collegiate defines
investment both ways: it is an action, (the Keynesian usage); it is
also an asset being held, a store of value. Such a two-faced word is a
natural medium for double-talk, and has been so exploited, to the
detriment of general understanding.</i><span style="font-style: italic;">]</span><b>
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Every Keynesian also knew in 1961
that investment means net,
positive-sum investing. It does not include buying and selling
existing assets like land: these are zero-sum transactions,
macro-economically non-functional and barren. [Keynes, although
careless of consistency, generally took care to distinguish old and new
assets. " ... the competition of a high interest-rate on mortgages may
well have had the same effect in retarding the growth of wealth from
current investment in newly produced capital-assets as high interest
rates on long-term debts ... " <small>[<i>General Theory, 1936, p.
241.] The old macro-economists generally refer to investing in newly
produced assets as "income- creating expenditure," which is clear and
correct, but too much of a mouthful.</i>]</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I use "investing" only
in the sense of net, income-creating, job-making spending.<small> [<i>Note
the difference between real turnover and mere ownership turnover.
Ownership turnover generates no income (except for brokers and M&amp;A
personnel) and creates no capital. Real turnover also creates no
capital, but does forward supplies of goods to consume, and flows of
investing to produce replacement goods. Most of gross investing is
reinvesting funds received or anticipated from sales of old capital
(including inventories, which turn fast, and "fixed" capital which
turns slowly as it depreciates and the funds are reinvested).</i>]<b>

<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to
borrowing on land, that can be worse than barren when the financial
system rises and falls on a land bubble, as it has and is.&nbsp; ... <a

Justice</small></small></a>&nbsp; (1982)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... In our economy, land is a
ready object of speculation, and its
value is constantly reflecting this evil. What happens in a rising
market, the up side of a business cycle, is that investors see rising
prices in land as indicative of a boom. Thereupon, they try to
increase their holdings in such land, only to discover that their
present returns will not pay for the present costs of land; the
current price of land is not based on what the yield of that land is
today, but on what it is projected to be two or three years from now.
The difference tends to increase until a point is reached where the
imarginal buyer of land suddenly finds himself unable to meet the
rising costs to which he has subjected himself. With bankruptcy
threatening him or having already been forced upon him, the land
passes from his hands, and the market temporarily becomes overpriced.
The bankruptcies increase, and ultimately land values are brought
back to levels which represent current productivity, at which point
the new boom will have started. ... <a
