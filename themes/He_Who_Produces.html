  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>This speaks both to labor and to capital;
        each can be attributed to individual producers. Land is different: it is
        provided by God, by nature, and its
              value grows for reasons that don't relate to individual effort, so
        <em>none</em> of us is more entitled to its value than anyone else. This distinction
        is the basis of property rights and justice, and it is one that we currently
        fail to honor. Henry George made the distinction clear, and described a
        simple way to honor that distinction, via taxing land value.</p>
      <p>In allowing those who own choice land to privatize the economic rent,
        we force ourselves into taxing things we have no right to tax in order
        to support community spending.</p>

      <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
          of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
          Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>As to the right of ownership, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
        <p>Being created individuals, with individual wants and powers, men are
          individually entitled (subject of course to the moral obligations that
          arise from such relations as that of the family) to the use of their
          own powers and the enjoyment of the results. There thus arises, anterior
          to human law, and deriving its validity from the law of God, a right
          of private ownership in things produced by labor &#8212; a right that
          the possessor may transfer, but of which to deprive him without his
          will is theft.</p>
        <p>This right of property, originating in the right of the individual
          to himself, is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches
          to things produced by labor, but cannot attach to things created by
          God.</p>
        <p>Thus,<strong> if a man take a fish from the ocean he acquires a right
            of property in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by
            sale or gift. </strong><em>But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean, so that
          he may sell it or give it or forbid others to use it.</em></p>
        <p>Or,<strong> if he set up a windmill he acquires a right of property
            in the things such use of wind enables him to produce. </strong><em>But he cannot claim
          a right of property in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or forbid
          others to use it.</em></p>
        <p>Or, <strong>if he cultivate grain he acquires a right of property
            in the grain his labor brings forth.</strong> <em>But he cannot obtain
            a similar right of property in the sun which ripened it or the soil
            on which it grew. </em>For these
          things are of the continuing gifts of God to all generations of men,
          which all may use, but none may claim as his alone.</p>
        <p>To attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership
          that justly attaches to things produced by labor is to impair and deny
          the true rights of property.<em><strong> For a man who out of the proceeds of his
          labor is obliged to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or
          sunshine or soil, all of which are to men involved in the single term
          land, is in this deprived of his rightful property and thus robbed.</strong></em>          <strong>...</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter
          with altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that
          hold when men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations
          and complex industries. In our cities of millions and our states of
          scores of millions, in a civilization where the division of labor has
          gone so far that large numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users,
          it still remains true that we are all land animals and can live only
          on land, and that land is God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one
          can be deprived without being murdered, and for which no one can be
          compelled to pay another without being robbed. But even in a state
          of society where the elaboration of industry and the increase of permanent
          improvements have made the need for private possession of land wide-spread,
          there is no difficulty in conforming individual possession with the
          equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land will yield to
          the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor on other
          land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
          Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any
          improvements in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the
          benefit to which all are entitled in its use, as distinguished from
          the value which, as producer or successor of a producer, belongs to
          the possessor in individual right.</p>
        <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of
          common ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common
          uses what value attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor
          on it. The principle is the same as in the case referred to, where
          a human father leaves equally to his children things not susceptible
          of specific division or common use. In that case such things would
          be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
        <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
          men, would have the community act.</p>
        <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
          letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the
          task, impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land
          in equal shares; still less the yet more impossible task of keeping
          it so divided.</p>
        <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
          with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
          to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value
          of the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements
          on it. <strong>And since this would provide amply for the need of public
          revenues, we would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal
          of all taxes
          now levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which
          taxes, since they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements
          of the right of property.</strong></p>
        <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as
          a conforming of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
        <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that
          clash.</p>
        <p><strong>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
          is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each
          one has in the fruits of his labor;</strong></p>
        <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty
          has intended all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
        <p><strong>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there
          must be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry
          may be reconciled with the equal right to land.</strong></p>
        <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those
          socialists referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation
          of men in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right
          of private property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical
          seem to argue, that to secure the right of private property we must
          ignore the equality of right in the opportunities of life and labor.
          To say the one thing or the other is equally to deny the harmony of
          God&#8217;s laws.</p>
        <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the
          community of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual,
          satisfies both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty
          of the Creator and to each the full ownership of the products of his
          labor.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
        <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right
          to the bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products
          of labor is the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For
          we are not atheists, who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that
          he has any concern in politics and legislation.</p>
        <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
          is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the
          life of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as
          you too perceive, it is also true that the state is in the divinely
          appointed order. For He who foresaw all things and provided for all
          things, foresaw and provided that with the increase of population and
          the development of industry the organization of human society into
          states or governments would become both expedient and necessary.</p>
        <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
          This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse,
          industry rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with
          growth of population and advance of civilization the functions of the
          state increase and larger and larger revenues are needed.</p>
        <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained
          civilization as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and
          become more and more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have
          foreseen this increasing need for state revenues and have made provision
          for it. That is to say: The increasing need for public revenues with
          social advance, being a natural, God-ordained need, there must be a
          right way of raising them &#8212; some way that we can truly say is
          the way intended by God. It is clear that this right way of raising
          public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
        <p>Hence:</p>

                            to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
                            <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose
                            to tax, the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come
                            from any exertion of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the
                            values produced in this way being values of improvement which we would
                            exempt. The value of land irrespective of improvement is the value
                            that attaches to land by reason of increasing population and social
                            progress. This is a value that always goes to the owner as owner, and
                            never does and never can go to the user; for if the user be a different
                            person from the owner he must always pay the owner for it in rent or
                            in purchase-money; while if the user be also the owner, it is as owner,
                            not as user, that he receives it, and by selling or renting the land
                            he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases to be a user.</p>
                            <p><strong>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement
                                cannot lessen the rewards of industry, nor add
                                to prices,* nor in any way take from the
                            individual what belongs to the individual. </strong>They can take only the value
                            that attaches to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore
                            belongs to the community as a whole.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                            <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all
                                economists are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of
                                improvement or use &#8212; or what in the terminology of political
                                economy is styled rent, a term distinguished from the ordinary
                                use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments for the
                                use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
                                be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason
                                given in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller
                                or the will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply,
                                and therefore as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced
                                rests at a point determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever
                                tends to increase the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such
                                articles to the consumer increasing price by checking supply, and
                                whatever tends to reduce such cost decreasing price by increasing
                                supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco or cloth add to the price
                                that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening in the cost
                                of producing steel which improved processes have made in recent
                                years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no cost
                                of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
                              Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>

                            <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore
                                never be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they
                                in no wise increase the demand for land or enable landowners to
                                check supply by withholding land from use. Where rent depends on
                                mere monopolization, a case I mention because rent may in this
                                way be demanded for the use of land even before economic or natural
                                rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners were
                                able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
                                since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in
                                the case of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the
                                premiums they receive, would in no way increase the superiority
                                of their land and the demand for it. While, so far as price is
                                affected by speculative rent, to compel the landowners to pay taxes
                                on the value of land whether they were getting any income from
                                it or not, would make it more difficult for them to withhold land
                                from use; and to tax the full value would not merely destroy the
                              power but the desire to do so.</font></p>

                            <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
                            of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of
                            labor; to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual.
                            It would impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment
                            on thrift; it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution
                            of wealth, by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please,
                            without any artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public
                            purposes a value that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden,
                            that of all values is most easily ascertained and most certainly and
                            cheaply collected, it would enormously lessen the number of officials,
                            dispense with oaths, do away with temptations to bribery and evasion,
                            and abolish man-made crimes in themselves innocent.</p>
                            <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues
                            it needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order
                            and degree of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of
                            the mother for the nourishment of the babe.</p>
                            <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the
                            need for the state arises there are no land values. The products of
                            labor have value, but in the sparsity of population no value as yet
                            attaches to land itself. But as increasing density of population and
                            increasing elaboration of industry necessitate the organization of
                            the state, with its need for revenues, value begins to attach to land.
                            As population still increases and industry grows more elaborate, so
                            the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same time and from
                            the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
                            The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social
                            development, since the larger scale of production and the improvement
                            of processes tend steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land
                            on which population centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London
                            or New York or Melbourne. Consider the enormous value of land in such
                            cities as compared with the value of land in sparsely settled parts
                            of the same countries. To what is this due? Is it not due to the density
                            and activity of the populations of those cities &#8212; to the very
                            causes that require great public expenditure for streets, drains, public
                            buildings, and all the many things needed for the health, convenience
                            and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth of such cities
                            the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how the opening
                            of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public improvement,
                            adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural law &#8212; that
                            is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean anything else
                            than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the values
                            which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
                            <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper
                            still, and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose
                            of the intent. If we do so we may see in this natural law by which
                            land values increase with the growth of society not only such a perfectly
                            adapted provision for the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual
                            perceptions by showing us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose
                            with regard to the individual that gratifies our moral perceptions
                            by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
                            <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society
                              advances the one thing that increases in value
                              is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue
                            of which all growth of population, all advance of
                              the arts, all general improvements of whatever
                              kind, add to a fund that both the commands
                            of justice and the dictates of expediency prompt
                              us to take for the common uses of society. Now,
                              since increase in the fund available for
                            the common uses of society is increase in the gain
                              that goes equally to each member of society, is
                              it not clear that the law by which land
                            values increase with social advance while the value
                              of the products of labor does not increase, tends
                              with the advance of civilization
                            to make the share that goes equally to each member
                              of society more and more important as compared
                              with what goes to him from his individual
                            earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization
                              lessen relatively the differences that in a ruder
                              social state must exist between the
                            strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate?
                              Does it not show the purpose of the Creator to
                              be that the advance of man in civilization
                            should be an advance not merely to larger powers
                              but to a greater and greater equality, instead
                              of what we, by our ignoring of his intent,
                            are making it, an advance toward a more and more
                              monstrous inequality? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
                            <p>                              Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical,

                                of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed
                                or denied, makes your meaning, if we take isolated
                                sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading
                                it as a whole, there can be no doubt of your
                                intention that private property in land shall
                                be understood when you speak merely of private
                                property. With this interpretation, I find that
                                the reasons you urge for private property in
                                land are eight. Let us consider them in order
                                of presentation. You urge:</p>
                            <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property
                              is rightful property. (RN, paragraph 5) ...<br>
                              2. That private property in land proceeds from
                              man&#8217;s gift of reason. (RN, paragraphs 6-7.)
                              ...<br>
                              3. That private property in land deprives no one
                              of the use of land. (RN, paragraph 8.) ...<br>
                              4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership
                              in the land itself. (RN, paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
                              5. That private property in land has the support
                              of the common opinion of mankind, and has conduced
                              to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
                              by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
                              6. That fathers should provide for their children
                              and that private property in land is necessary
                              to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.)
                              ...<br>
                              7. That the private ownership of land stimulates
                              industry, increases wealth, and attaches men to
                              the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.)

                              8. That the right to possess private property in
                              land is from nature, not from man; that the state
                              has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
                              value of landownership in taxation would be unjust
                              and cruel to the private owner. (RN, paragraph
                              51.) ...</p>
                            <p><strong>4. That Industry expended on land gives
                                ownership in the land itself.</strong> (9-10.)</p>
                            <p>Your Holiness next contends that industry expended
                              on land gives a right to ownership of the land,
                              and that the improvement of land creates benefits
                              indistinguishable and inseparable from the land
                              itself.</p>
                            <p>This contention, if valid, could only justify
                              the ownership of land by those who expend industry
                              on it. It would not justify private property in
                              land as it exists. On the contrary, it would justify
                              a gigantic no-rent declaration that would take
                              land from those who now legally own it, the landlords,
                              and turn it over to the tenants and laborers. And
                              if it also be that improvements cannot be distinguished
                              and separated from the land itself, how could the
                              landlords claim consideration even for improvements
                              they had made?</p>
                            <p>But your Holiness cannot mean what your words
                              imply. What you really mean, I take it, is that
                              the original justification and title of landownership
                              is in the expenditure of labor on it. But neither
                              can this justify private property in land as it
                              exists. For is it not all but universally true
                              that existing land titles do not come from use,
                              but from force or fraud?</p>
                            <p>Take Italy! Is it not true that the greater part
                              of the land of Italy is held by those who so far
                              from ever having expended industry on it have been
                              mere appropriators of the industry of those who
                              have? Is this not also true of Great Britain and
                              of other countries? Even in the United States,
                              where the forces of concentration have not yet
                              had time fully to operate and there has been some
                              attempt to give land to users, it is probably true
                              today that the greater part of the land is held
                              by those who neither use it nor propose to use
                              it themselves, but merely hold it to compel others
                              to pay them for permission to use it.</p>
                            <p>And if industry give ownership to land what are
                              the limits of this ownership? If a man may acquire
                              the ownership of several square miles of land by
                              grazing sheep on it, does this give to him and
                              his heirs the ownership of the same land when it
                              is found to contain rich mines, or when by the
                              growth of population and the progress of society
                              it is needed for farming, for gardening, for the
                              close occupation of a great city? Is it on the
                              rights given by the industry of those who first
                              used it for grazing cows or growing potatoes that
                              you would found the title to the land now covered
                              by the city of New York and having a value of thousands
                              of millions of dollars?</p>
                            <p>But your contention is not valid. <strong>Industry
                                expended on land gives ownership in the fruits
                                of that industry,
                              but not in the land itself, just as industry expended
                              on the ocean would give a right of ownership to
                              the fish taken by it, but not a right of ownership
                              in the ocean. </strong>Nor yet is it true that private ownership
                              of land is necessary to secure the fruits of labor
                              on land; nor does the improvement of land create
                              benefits indistinguishable and inseparable from
                              the land itself. That secure possession is necessary
                              to the use and improvement of land I have already
                              explained, but that ownership is not necessary
                              is shown by the fact that in all civilized countries
                              land owned by one person is cultivated and improved
                              by other persons. Most of the cultivated land in
                              the British Islands, as in Italy and other countries,
                              is cultivated not by owners but by tenants. And
                              so the costliest buildings are erected by those
                              who are not owners of the land, but who have from
                              the owner a mere right of possession for a time
                              on condition of certain payments. Nearly the whole
                              of London has been built in this way, and in New
                              York, Chicago, Denver, San Francisco, Sydney and
                              Melbourne, as well as in continental cities, the
                              owners of many of the largest edifices will be
                              found to be different persons from the owners of
                              the ground. So far from the value of improvements
                              being inseparable from the value of land, it is
                              in individual transactions constantly separated.
                              For instance, one-half of the land on which the
                              immense Grand Pacific Hotel in Chicago stands was
                              recently separately sold, and in Ceylon it is a
                              not infrequent occurrence for one person to own
                              a fruit-tree and another to own the ground in which
                              it is implanted.</p>
                            <p>There is, indeed, no improvement of land, whether
                              it be clearing, plowing, manuring, cultivating,
                              the digging of cellars, the opening of wells or
                              the building of houses, that so long as its usefulness
                              continues does not have a value clearly distinguishable
                              from the value of the land. For land having such
                              improvements will always sell or rent for more
                              than similar land without them.</p>
                            <p>If, therefore, the state levy a tax equal to what
                              the land irrespective of improvement would bring,
                              it will take the benefits of mere ownership, but
                              will leave the full benefits of use and improvement,
                              which the prevailing system does not do. And since
                              the holder, who would still in form continue to
                              be the owner, could at any time give or sell both
                              possession and improvements, subject to future
                              assessment by the state on the value of the land
                              alone, he will be perfectly free to retain or dispose
                              of the full amount of property that the exertion
                              of his labor or the investment of his capital has
                              attached to or stored up in the land.</p>
                            <p><strong>Thus, what we propose would secure, as
                                it is impossible in any other way to secure,
                                what you properly say
                              is just and right &#8212; &#8220;that the results
                              of labor should belong to him who has labored.&#8221; But
                              private property in land &#8212; to allow the holder
                              without adequate payment to the state to take for
                              himself the benefit of the value that attaches
                              to land with social growth and improvement &#8212; does
                              take the results of labor from him who has labored,
                              does turn over the fruits of one man&#8217;s labor
                              to be enjoyed by another. For labor, as the active
                              factor, is the producer of all wealth. Mere ownership
                              produces nothing.</strong> A man might own a world, but
                              so sure is the decree that &#8220;by the sweat
                              of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,&#8221; that without
                              labor he could not get a meal or provide himself
                              a garment. Hence, when the owners of land, by virtue
                              of their ownership and without laboring themselves,
                              get the products of labor in abundance, these things
                              must come from the labor of others, must be the
                              fruits of others&#8217; sweat, taken from those
                              who have a right to them and enjoyed by those who
                              have no right to them.</p>
                            <p><strong>The only utility of private ownership
                                of land as distinguished from possession is the
                                evil utility
                              of giving to the owner products of labor he does
                              not earn. </strong>For until land will yield to its owner
                              some return beyond that of the labor and capital
                              he expends on it &#8212; that is to say, until
                              by sale or rental he can without expenditure of
                              labor obtain from it products of labor, ownership
                              amounts to no more than security of possession,
                              and has no value. <strong>Its importance and value
                              begin only when, either in the present or prospectively,
                              it will yield a revenue &#8212; that is to say,
                              will enable the owner as owner to obtain products
                              of labor without exertion on his part, and thus
                              to enjoy the results of others&#8217; labor.</strong></p>
                            <p>What largely keeps men from realizing the robbery
                              involved in private property in land is that in
                              the most striking cases the robbery is not of individuals,
                              but of the community. For, as I have before explained,
                              it is impossible for rent in the economic sense &#8212; that
                              value which attaches to land by reason of social
                              growth and improvement &#8212; to go to the user.
                              It can go only to the owner or to the community.
                              Thus those who pay enormous rents for the use of
                              land in such centers as London or New York are
                              not individually injured. Individually they get
                              a return for what they pay, and must feel that
                              they have no better right to the use of such peculiarly
                              advantageous localities without paying for it than
                              have thousands of others. And so, not thinking
                              or not caring for the interests of the community,
                              they make no objection to the system.</p>
                            <p>It recently came to light in New York that a man
                              having no title whatever had been for years collecting
                              rents on a piece of land that the growth of the
                              city had made very valuable. Those who paid these
                              rents had never stopped to ask whether he had any
                              right to them. They felt that they had no right
                              to land that so many others would like to have,
                              without paying for it, and did not think of, or
                              did not care for, the rights of all. ...</p>
                            <p><strong>8. That the right to possess private property
                              in land is from nature, not from man; that the

                              the value of landownership in taxation would be
                              unjust and cruel to the private owner.</strong> (51.)</p>
                            <p>This, like much else that your Holiness says,
                              is masked in the use of the indefinite terms &#8220;private
                              property&#8221; and &#8220;private owner&#8221; &#8212; a
                              want of precision in the use of words that has
                              doubtless aided in the confusion of your own thought.
                              But the context leaves no doubt that by private
                              property you mean private property in land, and
                              by private owner, the private owner of land.</p>
                            <p>The contention, thus made, that private property
                              in land is from nature, not from man, has no other
                              basis than the confounding of ownership with possession
                              and the ascription to property in land of what
                              belongs to its contradictory, property in the proceeds
                              of labor. You do not attempt to show for it any
                              other basis, nor has any one else ever attempted
                              to do so. <strong>That private property in the
                              products of labor is from nature is clear, for
                              nature gives
                              such things to labor and to labor alone. Of every
                              article of this kind, we know that it came into
                              being as nature&#8217;s response to the exertion
                              of an individual man or of individual men &#8212; given
                              by nature directly and exclusively to him or to
                              them. Thus there inheres in such things a right
                              of private property, which originates from and
                              goes back to the source of ownership, the maker
                              of the thing.</strong> This right is anterior to the state
                              and superior to its enactments, so that, as we
                              hold, it is a violation of natural right and an
                              injustice to the private owner for the state to
                              tax the processes and products of labor. They do
                              not belong to Caesar. They are things that God,
                              of whom nature is but an expression, gives to those
                              who apply for them in the way he has appointed &#8212; by
                              labor.</p>
                            <p>But who will dare trace the individual ownership
                              of land to any grant from the Maker of land? What
                              does nature give to such ownership? how does she
                              in any way recognize it? Will any one show from
                              difference of form or feature, of stature or complexion,
                              from dissection of their bodies or analysis of
                              their powers and needs, that one man was intended
                              by nature to own land and another to live on it
                              as his tenant? That which derives its existence
                              from man and passes away like him, which is indeed
                              but the evanescent expression of his labor, man
                              may hold and transfer as the exclusive property
                              of the individual; but how can such individual
                              ownership attach to land, which existed before
                              man was, and which continues to exist while the
                              generations of men come and go &#8212; the unfailing
                              storehouse that the Creator gives to man for &#8220;the
                              daily supply of his daily wants&#8221;?</p>
                            <p>                              Clearly, the private ownership of land is from
                              the state, not from nature. Thus, not merely can
                              no objection be made on the score of morals when
                              it is proposed that the state shall abolish it
                              altogether, but insomuch as it is a violation of
                              natural right, its existence involving a gross
                              injustice on the part of the state, an &#8220;impious
                              violation of the benevolent intention of the Creator,&#8221; it
                              is a moral duty that the state so abolish it.</p>
                            <p>So far from there being anything unjust in taking
                              the full value of landownership for the use of
                              the community, the real injustice is in leaving
                              it in private hands &#8212; an injustice that amounts
                              to robbery and murder.</p>
                            <p>And when your Holiness shall see this I have no
                              fear that you will listen for one moment to the
                              impudent plea that before the community can take
                              what God intended it to take &#8212; before men
                              who have been disinherited of their natural rights
                              can be restored to them, the present owners of
                              land shall first be compensated.</p>
                            <p>For not only will you see that the single tax
                              will directly and largely benefit small landowners,
                              whose interests as laborers and capitalists are
                              much greater than their interests as landowners,
                              and that though the great landowners &#8212; or
                              rather the propertied class in general among whom
                              the profits of landownership are really divided
                              through mortgages, rent-charges, etc. &#8212; would
                              relatively lose, they too would be absolute gainers
                              in the increased prosperity and improved morals;
                              but more quickly, more strongly, more peremptorily
                              than from any calculation of gains or losses would
                              your duty as a man, your faith as a Christian,
                              forbid you to listen for one moment to any such
                              paltering with right and wrong.</p>
                            <p>Where the state takes some land for public uses
                              it is only just that those whose land is taken
                              should be compensated, otherwise some landowners
                              would be treated more harshly than others. But
                              where, by a measure affecting all alike, rent is
                              appropriated for the benefit of all, there can
                              be no claim to compensation. Compensation in such
                              case would be a continuance of the same in another
                              form &#8212; the giving to landowners in the shape
                              of interest of what they before got as rent. Your
                              Holiness knows that justice and injustice are not
                              thus to be juggled with, and when you fully realize
                              that land is really the storehouse that God owes
                              to all his children, you will no more listen to
                              any demand for compensation for restoring it to
                              them than Moses would have listened to a demand
                              that Pharaoh should be compensated before letting
                              the children of Israel go.</p>
                            <p>Compensated for what? For giving up what has been
                              unjustly taken? The demand of landowners for compensation
                              is not that. We do not seek to spoil the Egyptians.
                              We do not ask that what has been unjustly taken
                              from laborers shall be restored. We are willing
                              that bygones should be bygones and to leave dead
                              wrongs to bury their dead. We propose to let those
                              who by the past appropriation of land values have
                              taken the fruits of labor to retain what they have
                              thus got. We merely propose that for the future
                              such robbery of labor shall cease &#8212; that
                              for the future, not for the past, landholders shall
                              pay to the community the rent that to the community
                              is justly due. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
                            <p>It seems to us that your Holiness misses its real
                              significance in intimating that Christ, in becoming
                              the son of a carpenter and himself working as a
                              carpenter, showed merely that &#8220;there is nothing
                              to be ashamed of in seeking one&#8217;s bread by
                              labor.&#8221; To say that is almost like saying
                              that by not robbing people he showed that there
                              is nothing to be ashamed of in honesty. If you
                              will consider how true in any large view is <strong>the
                              classification of all men into working-men, beggar-men
                              and thieves</strong>, you will see that it was morally impossible
                              that Christ during his stay on earth should have
                              been anything else than a working-man, since he
                              who came to fulfil the law must by deed as well
                              as word obey God&#8217;s law of labor.</p>
                            <p>See how fully and how beautifully Christ&#8217;s
                              life on earth illustrated this law. Entering our
                              earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as it
                              is appointed that all should enter it, he lovingly
                              took what in the natural order is lovingly rendered,
                              the sustenance, secured by labor, that one generation
                              owes to its immediate successors. Arrived at maturity,
                              he earned his own subsistence by that common labor
                              in which the majority of men must and do earn it.
                              Then passing to a higher &#8212; to the very highest &#8212; sphere
                              of labor, he earned his subsistence by the teaching
                              of moral and spiritual truths, receiving its material
                              wages in the love-offerings of grateful hearers,
                              and not refusing the costly spikenard with which
                              Mary anointed his feet. So, when he chose his disciples,
                              he did not go to landowners or other monopolists
                              who live on the labor of others, but to common
                              laboring-men. And when he called them to a higher
                              sphere of labor and sent them out to teach moral
                              and spiritual truths, he told them to take, without
                              condescension on the one hand or sense of degradation
                              on the other, the loving return for such labor,
                              saying to them that &#8220;the laborer is worthy
                              of his hire,&#8221; thus showing, what we hold,
                              that all labor does not consist in what is called
                              manual labor, but that whoever helps to add to
                              the material, intellectual, moral or spiritual
                              fullness of life is also a laborer.*</p>

      <p>Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down while
        productive power grows, because land, which is the source of all wealth
        and the field of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate poverty, to
        make wages what justice commands they should be, the full earnings of
        the laborer, we must therefore substitute for the individual ownership
        of land a common ownership. [footnote omitted]</p>
      <p>This right of ownership that springs from labor excludes the possibility
        of any other right of ownership. If a man be rightfully entitled to the
        produce of his labor, then no one can be rightfully entitled to the ownership
        of anything which is not the produce of his labor, or the labor of some
        one else from whom the right has passed to him. For the right to the
        produce of labor cannot be enjoyed without the right to the free use
        of the opportunities offered by nature, and to admit the right of property
        in these is to deny the right of property in the produce of labor. When
        nonproducers can claim as rent a portion of the wealth created by producers,
        the right of the producers to the fruits of their labor is to that extent
        denied.</p>
      <p>A house and the lot on which it stands are alike property, as being
        the subject of ownership, and are alike classed by the lawyers as real
        estate. Yet in nature and relations they differ widely.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The one is produced by human labor, and belongs to the class in
          political economy styled wealth.</li>
        <li> The other is a part of nature, and belongs to the class in political
          economy styled land.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The essential character of the one class of things is that they embody
        labor, are brought into being by human exertion, their existence or nonexistence,
        their increase or diminution, depending on man. The essential character
        of the other class of things is that they do not embody labor, and exist
        irrespective of human exertion and irrespective of man; they are the
        field or environment in which man finds himself; the storehouse from
        which his needs must be supplied, the raw material upon which and the
        forces with which alone his labor can act.</p>
      <p>The moment this distinction is realized, that moment is it seen that
        the sanction which natural justice gives to one species of property is
        denied to the other. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/06_The_Remedy.htm">read

    IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
    production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered. ...</p>
  <p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
  <p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
      of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
      an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
      would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would be
      felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates upon
      exchange like artificial deserts and mountains;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to carry
          them around the world.</li>
    <li> It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a
      fine upon those qualities.</li>
    <li> If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
      been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually to
      make
          me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than
      you.</li>
    <li> If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
    <li> If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he
      had done an injury to the state;</li>
    <li> if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though
          it were a public nuisance;</li>
    <li> if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which would
          go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
    <li> We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it among
          us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.</li>
    <li> We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
      grain,</li>
    <li> we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have attempted
      to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have
      before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
      prices.</p>
  <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of taxation
      from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory;
      the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship;
    the farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would
    be
      free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed
    by the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The
      more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the state
      would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising
      as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall not be fined
      for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before; you shall not
      be taxed
      for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
  <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
      the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
      the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
      reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural reward.
      The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep
      to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
      enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
      advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
      the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain
      to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
      supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
      it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
      rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
      else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
      besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
  <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts him
      to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
      and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
      and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
      And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
      and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
      labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
      this would commensurately increase.</p>
  <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
      or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
      of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
      one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
      would everywhere be thrown open to improvement. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    and Thence Upon Production</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all public
      burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated until we
      consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
  <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
      in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
      inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
      as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands, gives
      a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced by labor and
      capital.</p>
  <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
      and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
      this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
      the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed. Rent,
      instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality. Labor and
      capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the
      state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
      would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
  <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided into
      two portions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
          producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;</li>
    <li> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
          in public benefits to all its members.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young children
      and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as well as the vigorous.
      And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents the result of individual
      effort in production, the other represents the increased power with which
      the community as a whole aids the individual.</p>
  <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by the
      community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce inequality
      as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater and greater
      equality. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/11_Effects_upon_Sharing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
      are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to
    the fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this
    is a proposition
      to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will
    show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as
    landholders
      do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
      And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may
    lose relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For,
    the
      increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain
    very much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these
    gains,
      and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the
    whole community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
          all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head -- laborers,
      operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional men of all sorts.</li>
    <li> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
      by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital -- storekeepers, merchants,
          manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of
      all sorts
          from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner -- and</li>
    <li> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose
          incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Take, now, the case of the homestead owner -- the mechanic, storekeeper, or
      professional man who has secured himself a house and lot, where he lives, and
      which he contemplates with satisfaction as a place from which his family cannot
      be ejected in case of his death. He will not be injured; on the contrary, he
      will be the gainer. The selling value of his lot will diminish -- theoretically
      it will entirely disappear. But its usefulness to him will not disappear. It
      will serve his purpose as well as ever. While, as the value of all other lots
      will diminish or disappear in the same ratio, he retains the same security
      of always having a lot that he had before. That is to say, he is a loser only
      as the man who has bought himself a pair of boots may be said to be a loser
      by a subsequent fall in the price of boots. His boots will be just as useful
      to him, and the next pair of boots he can get cheaper. So, to the homestead
      owner, his lot will be as useful, and should he look forward to getting a larger
      lot, or having his children, as they grow up, get homesteads of their own,
      he will, even in the matter of lots, be the gainer. And in the present, other
      things considered, he will be much the gainer. <strong>For though he will have more
      taxes to pay upon his land, he will be released from taxes upon his house and
      improvements, upon his furniture and personal property, upon all that he and
      his family eat, drink and wear, while his earnings will be largely increased
      by the rise of wages, the constant employment, and the increased briskness
      of trade. His only loss will be, if he wants to sell his lot without getting
      another, and this will be a small loss compared with the great gain. </strong></p>
  <p>...In short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist, as well
          as a landowner, and it is by his labor and capital that his living is made.
          His
        loss would be nominal; his gain would be real and great. In varying degrees
        is this true of all landholders. Many landholders are laborers of one sort
        or another. This measure would make no one poorer but such as could be made
        a great deal poorer without being really hurt. It would cut down great fortunes,
        but it would impoverish no one.</p>
  <p>Wealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally distributed.
      I do not mean that each individual would get the same amount of wealth. That
      would not be equal distribution, so long as different individuals have different
      powers and different desires. But I mean that wealth would be distributed in
      accordance with the degree in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence
      of each contributed to the common stock. The great cause which concentrates
      wealth in the hands of those who do not produce, and takes it from the hands
      of those who do, would be gone. The inequalities that continued to exist would
      be those of nature, not the artificial inequalities produced by the denial
      of natural law. The nonproducer would no longer roll in luxury while the producer
      got but the barest necessities of animal existence. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>THE term Labor includes all human exertion in the production of wealth,
    whatever its mode. In common parlance we often speak of brain labor and hand
    labor as though they were entirely distinct kinds of exertion, and labor
    is often spoken of as though it involved only muscular exertion. But in reality
    any form of labor, that is to say, any form of human exertion in the production
    of wealth above that which cattle may be applied to doing, requires the human

IT seems to us that your Holiness misses its real significance in intimating
that Christ in becoming the son of a carpenter and Himself working as a carpenter
showed merely that "there is nothing to be ashamed of in seeking one's bread
by labor." To say that is almost like saying that by not robbing people He showed
that there is nothing to be ashamed of in honesty. If you will consider how true
in any large view is the classification of all men into working-men, beggar-men
and thieves, you will see that it was morally impossible that Christ during His
stay on earth should have been anything else than a working-man, since He who
came to fulfill the law must by deed as well as word obey God's law of labor.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
See how fully and how beautifully Christ's life on earth illustrated this law.
Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as it is appointed that
all should enter it, He lovingly took what in the natural order is lovingly rendered,
the sustenance, secured by labor, that one generation owes to its immediate successors.
Arrived at maturity, He earned His own subsistence by that common labor in which
the majority of men must and do earn it. Then passing to a higher &#8212; to
the very highest-sphere of labor. He earned His subsistence by the teaching of
moral and spiritual truths, receiving its material wages in the love offerings
of grateful hearers, and not refusing the costly spikenard with which Mary anointed
his feet. So, when He chose His disciples, He did not go to land-owners or other
monopolists who live on the labor of others but to common laboring men. And when
He called them to a higher sphere of labor and sent them out to teach moral and
spiritual truths He told them to take, without condescension on the one hand,
or sense of degradation on the other, the loving return for such labor, saying
to them that the "laborer is worthy of his hire," thus showing, what we hold,
that all labor does not consist in what is called manual labor, but that whoever
helps to add to the material, intellectual, moral, or spiritual fulness of life
is also a laborer. - <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition

NOR should it be forgotten that the investigator, the philosopher, the teacher,
the artist, the poet, the priest, though not engaged in the production of wealth,
are not only engaged in the production of utilities and satisfactions to which
the production of wealth is only a means, but by acquiring and diffusing knowledge,
stimulating mental powers and elevating the moral sense, may greatly increase
the ability to produce wealth. For man does not live by bread alone. He is not
an engine, in which so much fuel gives so much power. On a capstan bar or a topsail
halyard a good song tells like muscle, and a "Marseillaise" or a "Battle Hymn
of the Republic" counts for bayonets. A hearty laugh, a noble thought, a perception
of harmony, may add to the power of dealing even with material things. <br>
<br>
He who by any exertion of mind or body adds to the aggregate of enjoyable wealth,
increases the sum of human knowledge or gives to human life higher elevation
or greater fulness &#8212; he is, in the large meaning of the words, a "producer," a "working-man," a "laborer," and
is honestly earning honest wages. But he who without doing aught to make mankind
richer, wiser, better, happier, lives on the toil of others &#8212; he, no matter
by what name of honor he may be I called, or how lustily the priests of Mammon
may swing their censers before him, is in the last analysis but a beggarman or
a thief. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, Chapter 7 <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT7.html#Chapter%207">econlib</a><br>
NATURE acknowledges no ownership or control in man save as the result
            of exertion. In no other way can her treasures be drawn forth, her
            powers directed, or her forces utilized or controlled. She makes
          no discriminations
            among men,
            but is to all absolutely impartial. She knows no distinction between
            master and slave, king and subject, saint and sinner. All men to
          her stand upon an equal footing and have equal rights. She recognizes
          no
            claim but that of labor, and recognizes that without respect to the
            claimant. If a pirate spread his sails, the wind will fill them as
            well as it will fill those of a peaceful merchantman or missionary
            bark; if
            a king and a common man be thrown overboard, neither can keep his
          head above the water except by swimming; birds will not come to be
          shot
            by the proprietor of the soil any quicker than they will come to
          be shot by the poacher; fish will bite or will not bite at a hook in
          utter
            disregard as to whether it is offered them by a good little boy who
            goes to Sunday school, or a bad little boy who plays truant; grain
            will grow only as the ground is prepared and the seed is sown; it
          is only
            at the call of labor that ore can be raised from the mine; the sun
            shines and the rain falls alike upon just and unjust. The laws of
          nature are
            the decrees of the Creator. There is written in them no recognition
            of any right save that of labor; and in them is written broadly and
            clearly the equal right of all men to the use and enjoyment of nature;
            to apply to her by their exertions, and to receive and possess her
            reward. Hence, as nature gives only to labor, the exertion of labor
            in production is the only title to exclusive possession. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only
upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon
them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community,
for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community.
It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent is
taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality ordained
by nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage over any other citizen
save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence; and each will obtain
what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor get its full reward,
and capital its natural return. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land values as
    the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British traditions. A
    land tax of four shillings in the pound of rental value is still nominally
    enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation made in the reign of
    William III, it amounts in reality to not much over a penny in the pound.
    With the abolition of indirect taxation this is the tax to which men would
    naturally turn. The resistance of landholders would bring up the question
    of title, and thus any movement which went so far as to propose the substitution
    of direct for indirect taxation must inevitably end in a demand for the restoration
    to the British people of their birthright. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free

  THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the natural
  result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among whom equality and
  individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in theory at least, that
  the land belongs to society at large, not to the individual. Rude outcome of
  an age in which might stood for right as nearly as it ever can (for the idea
  of right is ineradicable from the human mind, and must in some shape show itself
  even in the association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted
  in no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was essentially
  a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign, theoretically
  the representative of the collective power and rights of the whole people,
  was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land. And though land was granted
  to individual possession, yet in its possession were involved duties, by which
  the enjoyer of its revenues was supposed to render back to the commonwealth
  an equivalent for the benefits which from the delegation of the common right
  he received. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book
  VII, Chapter 4, Justice of the Remedy: Private Property in Land Historically
  Considered</a></p>
  <p>THE abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long Parliament,
    ratified after the accession of Charles II, though simply an appropriation
    of public revenues by the feudal landowners, who thus got rid of the consideration
    on which they held the common property of the nation, and saddled it on the
    people at large in the taxation of all consumers, has been long characterized,
    and is still held up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom.
    Yet here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England.
    Had the form of these feudal dues been simply changed into one better adapted
    to the changed times, English wars need never have occasioned the incurring
    of debt to the amount of a single pound, and the labor and capital of England
    need not have been taxed a single farthing for the maintenance of a military
    establishment. All this would have come from rent, which the landholders
    since that time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from the tax which
    land ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital. The landholders
    of England got their land on terms which required them even in the sparse
    population of Norman days to put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand
    perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further condition of various fines
    and incidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent. It would
    probably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these various services
    and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had the landholders been
    kept to this contract and no land been permitted to be inclosed except upon
    similar terms, the income accruing to the nation from English land would
    today be greater by many millions than the entire public revenues of the
    United Kingdom. England today might have enjoyed absolute free trade. There
    need not have been a customs duty, an excise, license or income tax, yet
    all the present expenditures could be met, and a large surplus remain to
    be devoted to any purpose which would conduce to the comfort or well-being
    of the whole people. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

devil's service, this is that scripture. How often have these words been distorted
from their obvious meaning to soothe conscience into acquiescence in human misery
and degradation &#8212; to bolster that blasphemy, the very negation and denial
of Christ's teachings, that the All Wise and Most Merciful, the Infinite Father,
has decreed that so many of His creatures must be poor&nbsp; in order that others
of His creatures to whom He wills the good things of life should enjoy the please
and virtue of doling out alms!&nbsp; "The poor ye have always with you," said
Christ; but all His teachings supply the limitation, "until the coming of the
Kingdom."&nbsp; In that kingdom of God <span style="font-style: italic;">on earth</span>,

WE naturally despise poverty; and it is reasonable that we should. I do not say &#8212; I
distinctly repudiate it &#8212; that the people who are poor are poor always
from their own fault, or even in most cases; but it ought to be so. If any good
man or woman had the power to create a world, it would be a sort of a world in
which no one would be poor unless he was lazy or vicious. But that is just precisely
the kind of a world that this is; that is just precisely, the kind of a world
that the Creator has made. <strong>Nature gives to labor, and to labor alone;
there must be human work before any article of wealth can be produced; and, in
a natural
state of things, the man who toiled honestly and well would be the rich man,
and he who did not work would be poor. We have so reversed the order of nature,
that we are accustomed to think of a working-man as a poor man. </strong>&#8212; <a href="crime_of_poverty.html">The

    <p><font size="-1">Henry George says: &quot;Land, labor, and capital are the factors of production.
        The term land includes all natural opportunities or forces; the term labor,
        all human exertion; and the term capital, all wealth used to produce more
        wealth. . . Capital is not a necessary factor in production. Labor exerted
        upon land can produce wealth without the aid of capital, and in the necessary
        genesis of things must so produce wealth before capital can exist.&quot; &#8212; Progress

        the unthinking disguise, do not alter the fact that all production is still

        can be named which under any circumstances enters into productive processes
        that is not resolvable into either the one or the other. To satisfy all human
        wants mankind requires nothing but human labor and natural material, and
        each of them is indispensable.</font></p>

  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals.<strong> Wages, on the other hand, measure
        the earning power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society
        as a whole. </strong>We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and <strong>Individual Earnings.</strong> How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p><em>Q52. Is not the right of ownership of a gold ring the same as the ownership
    of a gold mine? and if the latter is wrong is not the former also wrong?</em><br>
    A. If it be wrong for you to own the spring of water which you and your fellows
    use, is it therefore wrong for you to own the water that you lift from the
    spring to drink? If so how do you propose to slake your thirst? If you argue
    in reply that it is not wrong for you to own the spring, then how shall your
    fellows slake their thirst when you treat them, as you would have a right
    to, as trespassers upon your property? To own the source of labor products
    is to own the labor of others; to own what you produce from that source is
    to own only your own labor. Nature furnishes gold mines, but men fashion
    gold rings. The right of ownership is radically different.</p>
  <p><em>Q53. Is it true that men are equally entitled to land? Are they not
      entitled to it in proportion to their use of it?</em><br>
A. Yes, they are entitled to it in proportion to their use of it and it is this
title that the single tax would secure. It would allow every one to possess as
much land as he wished, upon the sole condition that if it has a value he shall
account to the community for that value and for nothing else; all that he produces
from the land above its value being absolutely his, free even from taxation.
The single tax is the method best adapted to our circumstances, and to orderly
conditions, for limiting possession of land to its use. By making it unprofitable
to hold land except for use, or to hold more than can be used to advantage, it
constitutes every man his own judge of the amount and the character of the land
that he can use. </p>
  <p><em>Q57. If land and labor are equally indispensable factors of production,
    why are they not equally entitled to the product?</em><br>
    A. The laborer justly owns his labor, but the land-owner cannot justly own
    his land. The question is not one of the relative rights of men and land,
    but of men and men. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<p>Charles B. Fillebrown: <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">A Catechism
    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q1. What is a tax?</em><br />
A. A tax is a compulsory contribution of individual product or the value of such
  product toward the needs of government.</p>
  <p><em>Q13. What is meant by the right of property?</em><br>
A. As to the grain a man raises, or the house that he builds, it means ownership
  full and complete. As to land, it means legal title, tenure, &quot;estate in
  land,&quot; perpetual right of exclusive possession, a right not absolute,
  but superior to that of any other man.</p>
  <p><em>Q39. Is not land peculiar in that it is a gift of the Creator, and is not
    a product of labor?</em><br>
    A. Yes, that is true of land itself, but not of the value of land.</p>
  <p><em>Q46. Would it not be confiscation so to increase the tax on land?</em><br>
A. What would be confiscated? No land would be taken, no right of occupancy,
  or use, or improvement, or sale, or devise; nothing would be taken that is
  conveyed or guaranteed by the title deed.</p>
  <p><em>Q47. What is the distinction between taxation and confiscation?</em><br>
  A. The sovereign state may appropriate private property of its citizens in
    two ways: (1) by confiscation; (2) by taxation. When one particular man by
    treason or otherwise has forfeited his rights as a citizen, the land and
    houses and personalty of this one man may all be &quot;forfeit to the crown,&quot; while
    the validity and sanctity of 9,999 other men's rights are in no way infringed.
    This is confiscation. On the other hand, when the state, in order to obtain
    the revenue to meet the expenses of government, levies tribute upon its 10,000
    citizens impartially, this is taxation.</p>
  <p><em>Q48. But would it not be an injustice to the landowner?</em><br>
  A. If it be an injustice to tax hard-earned incomes (wages) to maintain an
    unearned income (net economic rent) that bears no tax burden, how can it
    be an injustice to stop doing so? There can be no injustice in taking for
    the benefit of the community the value that is created by the community.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah," says
Vernon. "I see what you mean. I have to
pay for the effects of my polluting actions or else I'd be robbing
someone else. Okay, I believe the Polluter Pays Principle now." ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the funny thing is, you don't really
believe it
yourself," says Vernon. "You aren't being consistent. You say goods and
services that we produce belong to the producers and no one else. But
you support the income tax and the sales tax. Those taxes take away
from the producer, without his or her consent, part of what he or she
produced. So it doesn't seem that you really believe your own claims.
Why should people support the Polluter Pays Principle that says they
are stuck with negative products they produce, when at the same time
you wouldn't allow them to keep the positive products they produce?
Sounds like an uneven deal."</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara is shocked. But she has to admit Vernon
has a
point. "Hmm, I guess this might be part of why the Polluter Pays
Principle doesn't excite as much support as it should. If we lived in a
world where people get to keep the full value of whatever their labor
and their investment yields, then pollution would stand out in sharp
contrast, as a crime against innocent people and their property. The
Polluter Pays Principle would be totally obvious then."</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And instead," says Vernon, "we're surrounded
by
cases of theft by income tax, by sales tax, and so on. Well then, no
wonder people aren't shocked when the Polluter Pays Principle isn't
applied. And no wonder some people don't even see the wisdom of it. "</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom line question is this -- can a
person
support the Polluter Pays Principle and support involuntary taxation
both, or is that inconsistent? Your opinion, please!&nbsp; ...<a

  Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We still need to judge whether it is fair for only landowners to pay the taxes,
      rather than to spread the burden on all who get income or spend money or have
      wealth.</p>
  <p>Natural-law philosophers such as John Locke have reasoned that all human
    beings have a natural ownership right to their labor and the products of
    that labor.
      The fundamental equality of humanity means it is fundamentally wrong for
    some to take away the labor done by others.31 That notion is almost universally
      recognized today with respect to slavery, and some folks are beginning
    to recognize
      that the current tax system&#8212;which taxes our earnings and taxes how we
      invest or spend those earnings&#8212;also violates man&#8217;s natural
      right to the fruits of his labor.</p>
  <p>If taking the fruit of one&#8217;s labor is fundamentally unjust, how can
      a community raise the monies needed to build essential infrastructure and provide
      public services? Land value taxation takes into account not only the value
      of the land due to nature, such as soil and climate, but also the great increase
      in land values that result from population, commerce, security and other civic
      services, and public works&#8212;elements beyond the activity of the property
      owner. The windfall increase in the rental or land value of the land, contended
      Henry George and others, is a surplus that can be tapped by the community.32</p>
  <p>Those suggesting positive consequences of shifting taxation to rent have
    been accused of exaggerating its beneficial effects.33 Freedom from punitive
    taxation
      is not a panacea, but the infliction of arbitrary costs on enterprise and
    the skewing of market signals such as prices and profits is indeed a universal
      and major cause of economic woes. It is not an exaggeration to propose
    that
      removing these would have many beneficial results, just as one&#8217;s
      health improves considerably if one stops taking poison. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, <strong>the result of every utilization or enhancement of the natural
      advantages of land (such as farm profits, the rent and selling value of buildings
      and other improvements), when accomplished by an individual, belongs wholly
      to that individual, and should never, and need never, be taken from him by
      taxation. </strong><font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>To illustrate simply, let us suppose a state which has never parted with
    its natural income but is supported by its own economic rent. A farmer wishes
    to
      take up a tract or [sic] government land in this state and offers an economic
      rent of fifty cents per year per acre in its raw condition. The government
      (i.e., the community) accepts this rent, subject to re-adjustment every
    five years. The farmer then gets his deed without other cost than that of
    drawing
      and recording the instrument, or a nominal price of, say, one dollar an
      acre.<br>
      <br>
      He works his new property vigorously, clears, fences, drains and plants it,
      and puts up his buildings and stocks them. He has no taxes to pay, and at the
      end of his first five-year period he is making $10 per acre per year. Will
      his economic rent for the next five-year period be raised because he has prospered
      or because he has invested money in buildings and improvements? Not a penny.
      All the results of his own capital and labor belong to him and not to the community.
      If the neighborhood has not grown much, and fifty cents an acre is still all
      that is bid as economic rent for the same kind of raw ground as our farmer
      originally took, then his rent for the second five years will be the same as
      the first. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p><small>I believe that the Creator
  freely gave the earth to all of His
  children, that all may have equal rights to its use. Do you agree to
  that?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>I believe that the injunction, "In the sweat of thy brow shalt
  thou eat
  bread," necessarily implies, "Thou shalt not eat bread in the sweat of
  thy brother's brow." Do you agree?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>I believe that all are violating the divine law who live in
  idleness on
  wealth produced by others, since they eat bread in the sweat of their
  brothers' brows. Do you agree?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>I believe that no man should have power to take wealth he has
  not
  produced or earned unless freely given to him by the producer. Do you
  agree?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>I believe that brotherhood requires giving an equivalent for
  every
  service received from a brother. Do you agree?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>I believe it is blasphemous to assert or insinuate that God has
  condemned some of His children to hopeless poverty, and to the Crimea,
  want, and misery resulting therefrom, and has, at the same time,
  awarded to others lives of ease and luxury, without labor. Do you agree?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>I believe that involuntary poverty and involuntary idleness are
  unnatural, and are due to the denial by some of the right of others to
  use freely the gift of God to all. Do you agree?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Since labor products are needed to sustain life, and since labor
  must
  be applied to land in order to produce, I believe that every child
  comes into life with divine permission to use land without the consent
  of any other child of God. Do you agree?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Where men congregate in organized society, land has a value
  apart from
  the value of things produced by labor; as population and industry
  increase, the value of land increases, but the value of labor products
  does not. That increase in land value is community-made value. Inasmuch
  as your power to labor is a gift of God, all the wealth produced by
  your labor is yours, and no man nor collection of men has a right to
  take any of it from you. Do you agree to that?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>I believe the community-made value of land belongs to the
  community,
  just as the wealth produced by you belongs to you. Do you agree to that?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Therefore, I believe that the fundamental evil, the great
  God-denying
  crime of society, is the iniquitous system under which men are
  permitted to put into their pocket, confiscate, in fact, the
  community-made values of land, while organized society confiscates for
  public purposes a part of the wealth created by individuals. Do you
  agree to that?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Using a concrete illustration: I own in the city of Philadelphia
  11-1/2
  acres of land, for which I paid 32,500 dollars a few years ago. On
  account of increase of population and industry in Philadelphia, that
  land is now worth about 125,000 dollars. I have expended no labor or
  money upon it. So I have done nothing to cause that increase of 92,500
  dollars in a few years. <span style="font-weight: bold;">My
  fellow-citizens in Philadelphia created it,
  and I believe it therefore belongs to them, not to me. I believe that
  the man-made law which gives to me and other landlords values we have
  not created is a violation of the divine law.</span> I believe that
  Justice
  demands that these community-made values be taken by the community for
  common purposes instead of taxing enterprise and industry. Do you
  agree?&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small>... <a href="../docs/Fels.html"><span

Weld Carter: <a
 href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html">An
Introduction to Henry George</a><br>
</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Ethics of Taxation </b><br>
  It was but a short step from the ethics of property to the ethics of taxation.
      George's position here was that as labor and capital rightfully and unconditionally
      own what they produce, no one can rightfully appropriate any of their earnings;
      nor can the State. On the other hand, land value is always a socially created
      value, never the result of action by the owner of the land. Therefore this
      is a value that must be taken by society; otherwise, those who comprise
      the social whole are deprived of what is rightfully theirs. Furthermore,
      to charge the owner for this value, in the form of taxation, is only to
      collect from him the precise value of the benefit he receives from society. </small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to the justice of taxes on products,
      George spoke of "...all taxes now levied on the products and processes
      of industry -- which taxes, since they take from the earnings of labor,
      we hold to be infringements of the right of property."&nbsp;</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Of the
        justice of taxes on land values, he said, "Adam Smith speaks of incomes
        as 'enjoyed under the protection of the state'; and this is the ground
        upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly
        insisted upon -- that it is equally protected by the state. The basis
        of this idea is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible
        by the state -- that there is a value created and maintained by the community,
        which is justly called upon to meet community expenses. Now of what values
        is this true? Only of the value of land. This is a value that does not
        arise until a community is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows
        with the growth of the community. It exists only as the community exists.
        Scatter again the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would
        have no value at all. With every increase of population the value of
        land rises; with every decrease it falls. ...</span> </small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The tax upon land values is, therefore,
      the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only upon those who receive
      from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion
      to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community, for the
      use of the community, that value which is the creation of the community.
      It is the application the common property to common uses."&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"><span
