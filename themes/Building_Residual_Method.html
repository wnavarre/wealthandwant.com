<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Building
Residual Method</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>How property is valued for tax purposes is important. Methods have improved
      signficantly in recent years, as computer-aided mass appraisal has become
    possible. The process of assessment is done somewhat differently from the
    appraisals
      that are done for mortgage underwriting and for insurance underwriting
    purposes. The goal is to estimate the value of each property, residential
    or commercial,
      relative to other properties in the municipality, so that the tax burden
    is shared justly among them. To do this correctly, the land and the building
    need
      to be valued separately. </p>
  <p>A properly done assessment measures two things: the total value of each property,
      as it exists at a particular time, and the value of the land alone. The difference
      between the two is the current value of the existing buildings. Depending on
      their age, the quality of the original materials and the construction, and
      the amount of updating and expansion that has taken place over the years, not
      to mention regular maintenance of systems, the building may exhibit very little
      obsolescense or be almost totally without value in today's marketplace.</p>
  <p>For residential property, valuations are fairly straightforward, as long as
      a reasonable number of houses change hand each year. And in places where
      vacant lots change hands or teardowns are occurring, valuing land is straightforward. For
      commercial property, there is a tendency to underassess the properties,
      perhaps because of the perception that large landholders also have deep
      pockets and
      might sue to get their assessments lowered. Because fewer properties change
      hands each year, there is a tendency to rely not on transactions, but on
      some valuation based on the net income the property enjoys. This, however,
      turns
      the property tax into an income tax, with all the perverse incentives associated
      with income taxes, and does nothing to encourage the owners of underused
      land to redevelop it. The building residual method is far more desirable.
      Value
      the land first, then look at the depreciated value of the existing buildings,
      which in the case of obsolete buildings, may be quite close to zero (and
      could even be negative, since it costs to tear them down and clean up the
      site).</p>
  <p>The widening spread in the ratio between what a property sells for and how
      much it rents for is in part the difference between the right of its owner
      to tear
      it down
      and build something else more suitable (usually a more intense use of the site)
      and the fact that all the tenant is getting is the right to use, from month
      to month, the existing building on that site. When property taxes are low,
      the landlord can afford to receive only that low level of rent on the property,
      while he waits for the land to appreciate due to factors he can take no credit
      for; when taxes on land values are somewhat higher, the landlord becomes motivated
      to replace the obsolete building which draws little rent with a more appropriate
      building which will provide him cash flow with which to pay the land tax. The
      land gets moved toward its highest and best use. Everyone benefits: those who
      need a place to live, those who want more jobs to choose from, those who want
      to start a business and need a centrally located site, those who want more
      vendors to choose from, those who seek the lower prices that competition and
      an active marketplace creates.</p>
  <p>And then, of course, there are states where assessment is <em>not</em> related
      to market value, but is primarily a function of how long one has owned one's
      property.
      In California, those who have owned a choice property for 25 or more years
      have assessments that are a tiny fraction of what identical neighboring properties
      which are owned by new owners carry. It doesn't matter what the property is
      worth in the marketplace. One's land can only appreciate at 2% per year, no
      matter what one builds on it. The incentives for using it well are minimal.
      And, since one's potential competitors will face a very different cost structure,
      one faces less competition, allowing one to charge higher prices. This is known
      as land monopoly capitalism. How does one fix that? Don't cap the assessment
      artificially, and don't cap the property tax. Let the property tax fall largely
      or entirely on land value. The land can take it, and we'll all benefit!</p>

  Land: How and why land gets undervalued</a><br>
  </div>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Turning land-value
gains into capital gains</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value
gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually
a "land gain", that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
new entries into the </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Forbes</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
or </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Hiding the free
lunch</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil
wins at the point where he
convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well.,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
that no free lunch exists. But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two appraisal
methods</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways.
Both start by estimating its
market value.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of
buildings from this overall value, designating the remainder as the
value of land. Building values may be estimated in terms of their
replacement cost (which usually produces a very high estimate, leaving
little land value) or their depreciated value (which gives an
unrealistically low building estimate, inasmuch as maintenance and
repairs save most buildings from deteriorating through wear and tear).
Using the depreciated value method leaves a higher residual land value.
The Federal Reserve Board recently has experimented with a hybrid
intermediate method that values buildings on the basis of their
"historical costs".</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing
the land,
and treats the difference as representing the building's value. The
first step in this approach is to construct a land-value map for the
district or city. This displays fairly smooth contours for land values.
Overlays would show zoning variations. Most of the variations in
property prices around this normalized map will be for structures,
along with a sizable component of "errors and omissions." This approach
rarely is used, and most assessed land values vary drastically from one
parcel to the next. The problem is especially apparent in the case of
parking lots or one-story "taxpayers," that is, inexpensive buildings
in neighbourhoods that are heavily built up. Their purpose is simply to
be rented out at enough to carry the property's tax bill, not to
maximise the site's current economic value.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
appraisal methods do not
acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
changed in comparison to the property's overall value?
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve
multiplies the building's original cost by the
rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is agreed that any
explanation of land/building relations
should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
<b><i>uniform</i></b> and <b><i>homogeneous</i></b> as possible. By
that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
accordingly.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
accepted, then I believe that economists
would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
opposite usually is done.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>How land gets a
negative value!</b>
</small></p>
<p
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE
DRIVING FORCE behind the anomalies is the political lobbying
eager to depict real estate gains simply as "protecting capital from
inflation." In reality, it helps land owners and their creditors get
a free ride out of land asset-price inflation -- that is, The
Bubble.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> <strong>...</strong></span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This leaves in limbo the
macro-economists and business analysts
whose business is to explain the finance, insurance and real
estate (FIRE) sector's dominant role in the economy. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">According to
the land-residual appraisal technique, high-rise buildings seem to
have the lowest land values. </span>Real estate interests argue that
this is
realistic, because at least in New York City the higher a building
is, the more of a subsidy its developers need, given the economics of
space involved for elevators, surrounding air space and so forth. The
land itself is assigned a negative value as a statistically balancing
residual reflecting the difference between the building's high
construction costs and its lower market value.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>One obvious problem with the
land-residual approach is that
many buildings would not be rebuilt in their existing form. ... </b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The land-residual approach
appears to work as long as a fairly
constant proportion of land to buildings is maintained.</span>
Statistically, this can occur only when property prices are rising at
about the same rate as commodity prices and wages. But business
cycles snake around the economy's basic trends, rising steadily and
then plunging sharply. This fluctuation is what causes the most
serious problems for statisticians.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
a thriving real estate market
appraisers typically use a rule
of thumb in allocating resale prices as between land and buildings to
reflect their pre-existing proportions. Buildings typically are
assumed to account for between 40 percent and 60 percent of the
property's value. As a result, building values are estimated to grow
along with a property's overall sales value. </span>This appraisal
practice
is made to appear plausible as the pace of asset-price inflation
tends to go hand in hand with rising construction costs, and hence in
the theoretical replacement cost of buildings.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As noted, the anomaly occurs when
real estate prices fall. Real
estate prices are volatile, while construction costs rarely dip more
than slightly, if at all. When real estate prices turn down, they
often plunge below the reproduction cost of buildings. Hence, the
residual ("land") rises and falls much more sharply than do building
replacement costs (which are estimated as rising at a fairly steady
pace) and overall property values.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result is a curious asymmetry.
Building prices seem to be
responsible for the rise in real estate prices, while land prices are
held responsible for their decline. When the fall in property values
intersects the rising reproduction-cost trend, the land residual
turns negative.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because this land value often
represents the owner's equity, this
decline may prompt heavily indebted owners to default on their loans
or even to walk away from their property, which reverts to the bank
or other mortgage holder. In this sense the financial system itself
is based largely on real estate, as the economy learned in the
savings and loan (S&amp;L) deposit insurance crisis of the late
1980s. Real estate prices reflect the supply of property (including a
fixed supply of land) as compared with the fluctuating supply of
mortgage credit, which tends to be a function of the economy's
overall liquidity.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Real estate
industry's priorities</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>REAL ESTATE LOBBIES recognize that
what is not seen is less likely
to be taxed. What is not quantified for public policy-makers to see
clearly may avoid taxes, leaving property owners with a larger
after-tax return. They prefer land-residual's capital gains
statistics at the national level, even as individual investors seek
site-value gains at the local level.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This explains the seeming irony
that investors in an industry
dealing primarily with the development of land sites have campaigned
to minimize the statistical treatment of land. Relegating land to
merely secondary status enables the real estate industry to depict
its "capital" gains as resulting from cost inflation and hence the
reproduction costs of buildings -- whose value is allowed to be
depreciated and re-depreciated at rising values over time. </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><small>The free
lunch of land-price gains is unseen as attention is diverted from the
real estate bubble and land-price inflation to building costs. These
fiscal considerations help to explain why it has been so hard to get
Washington to produce national land value statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
