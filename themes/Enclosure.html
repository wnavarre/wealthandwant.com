    Wasteland to Promised land:
    Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because George asserted, "We
        must make land common property," he is sometimes erroneously regarded
        as an advocate of land nationalization. But, as we have seen, he was
        nothing of the sort. The expropriation of land makes it practically
        impossible to fairly compensate people for the improvements to land,
        which are their legitimate property. <strong>George's system renders to the
        community what is due to the community, without doing any violence to
        the wealth that has been fairly earned by productive workers.</strong></small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Common property in land is sometimes discredited by equation
        with what Garrett Hardin calls "The Tragedy of the Commons." Referring
        to the common lands that were a major English institution until the
        mid-nineteenth century, Hardin describes the tendency of individuals,
        each rationally pursuing self-interest, to overgraze, denude, and use
        the commons as a cesspool. That which belongs to everybody in this
        sense is, indeed, in danger of being valued and maintained by nobody.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>The enclosure movement ultimately brought an end to this
        ecologically destructive process, but not without literally pushing
        people off the land, exacting a baneful price in human misery that
        might well be termed "The Tragedy of the Enclosures." George hit upon a
        way of securing the benefits of both commons and enclosures, while at
        the same time avoiding their evils. Land value taxation rectifies
        distribution so that all receive wealth in proportion to their
        contribution to its production. This liberates the economic system from
        exploiters who contribute little or nothing. Apportioning the wealth
        pie fairly increases the incentive to increase the size of the pie. The
        market becomes in practice what capitalist theory alleges it to be -- a
        profoundly cooperative process of voluntary exchange of goods and
        services. Paradoxical though it may seem, the only way the individual
        may be assured what properly belongs to him or her is for society to
        take what properly belongs to it: The ideal of Jeffersonian
        individualism requires for its actualization the socialization of rent.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Just as Marxists err in insisting that everything be socialized,
        extreme capitalists err in insisting that everything (even public parks
        and forests!) be privatized. The middle way is to recognize society's
        claim to what nature and society create -- the value of land and its
        rent -- so that working people, including entrepreneurs, may claim
        their full share of what they create. In this balanced approach can be
        found the authentic verities respectively inherent in socialism and
        individualism.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html"><span

    <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
        of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
      Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
        of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your
        meaning, if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But
        reading it as a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private
        property in land shall be understood when you speak merely of private
        property. With this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge
        for private property in land are eight. Let us consider them in order
        of presentation. You urge:</p>
      <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.
        (RN, paragraph 5) ...<br>
        2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
        (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
        3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land.
        (RN, paragraph 8.) ...<br>
        4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself.
        (RN, paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
        5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
        of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is
        sanctioned by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
        6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
        in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.)
        ...<br>
        7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases
        wealth, and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph
        51.) ...<br>
        8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature,
        not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to
        take the value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel
        to the private owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
      <p><strong>5. That private property in land has the support of the common
          opinion of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and
          that it is
        sanctioned by Divine Law. </strong>(11.)</p>
      <p>Even were it true that the common opinion of mankind has sanctioned
        private property in land, this would no more prove its justice than the
        once universal practice of the known world would have proved the justice
        of slavery.</p>
      <p>But it is not true. Examination will show that wherever we can trace
        them the first perceptions of mankind have always recognized the equality
        of right to land, and that when individual possession became necessary
        to secure the right of ownership in things produced by labor some method
        of securing equality, sufficient in the existing state of social development,
        was adopted. Thus, among some peoples, land used for cultivation was
        periodically divided, land used for pasturage and wood being held in
        common. Among others, every family was permitted to hold what land it
        needed for a dwelling and for cultivation, but the moment that such use
        and cultivation stopped any one else could step in and take it on like
        tenure. Of the same nature were the land laws of the Mosaic code. The
        land, first fairly divided among the people, was made inalienable by
        the provision of the jubilee, under which, if sold, it reverted every
        fiftieth year to the children of its original possessors.</p>
      <p>Private property in land as we know it, the attaching to land of the
        same right of ownership that justly attaches to the products of labor,
        has never grown up anywhere save by usurpation or force. Like slavery,
        it is the result of war. It comes to us of the modern world from your
        ancestors, the Romans, whose civilization it corrupted and whose empire
        it destroyed.</p>
      <p>It made with the freer spirit of the northern peoples the combination
        of the feudal system, in which, though subordination was substituted
        for equality, there was still a rough recognition of the principle of
        common rights in land. A fief was a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed
        some obligation. The sovereign, the representative of the whole people,
        was the only owner of land. Of him, immediately or mediately, held tenants,
        whose possession involved duties or payments, which, though rudely and
        imperfectly, embodied the idea that we would carry out in the single
        tax, of taking land values for public uses. The crown lands maintained
        the sovereign and the civil list; the church lands defrayed the cost
        of public worship and instruction, of the relief of the sick, the destitute
        and the wayworn; while the military tenures provided for public defense
        and bore the costs of war. A fourth and very large portion of the land
        remained in common, the people of the neighborhood being free to pasture
        it, cut wood on it, or put it to other common uses.</p>
      <p>In this partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to land
        is to be found the reason why, in a time when the industrial arts were
        rude, wars frequent, and the great discoveries and inventions of our
        time unthought of, the condition of the laborer was devoid of that grinding
        poverty which despite our marvelous advances now exists. Speaking of
        England, the highest authority on such subjects, the late Professor Therold
        Rogers, declares that in the thirteenth century there was no class so
        poor, so helpless, so pressed and degraded as are millions of Englishmen
        in our boasted nineteenth century; and that, save in times of actual
        famine, there was no laborer so poor as to fear that his wife and children
        might come to want even were he taken from them. Dark and rude in many
        respects as they were, these were the times when the cathedrals and churches
        and religious houses whose ruins yet excite our admiration were built;
        the times when England had no national debt, no poor law, no standing
        army, no hereditary paupers, no thousands and thousands of human beings
        rising in the morning without knowing where they might lay their heads
        at night.</p>
      <p><strong>With the decay of the feudal system, the system of private property
        in land that had destroyed Rome was extended. As to England, it may briefly
        be said that the crown lands were for the most part given away to favorites;
        that the church lands were parceled among his courtiers by Henry VIII.,
        and in Scotland grasped by the nobles; that the military dues were finally
        remitted in the seventeenth century, and taxation on consumption substituted;
        and that by a process beginning with the Tudors and extending to our
        own time all but a mere fraction of the commons were inclosed by the
        greater landowners; while the same private ownership of land was extended
        over Ireland and the Scottish Highlands, partly by the sword and partly
        by bribery of the chiefs. Even the military dues, had they been commuted,
        not remitted, would today have more than sufficed to pay all public expenses
        without one penny of other taxation.</strong></p>
      <p>Of the New World, whose institutions but continue those of Europe, it
        is only necessary to say that to the parceling out of land in great tracts
        is due the backwardness and turbulence of Spanish America; that to the
        large plantations of the Southern States of the Union was due the persistence
        of slavery there, and that the more northern settlements showed the earlier
        English feeling, land being fairly well divided and the attempts to establish
        manorial estates coming to little or nothing. In this lies the secret
        of the more vigorous growth of the Northern States. <strong>But the idea
        that land was to be treated as private property had been thoroughly established
        in English thought before the colonial period ended, and it has been
        so treated by the United States and by the several States. </strong>And though
        land was at first sold cheaply, and then given to actual settlers, it
        was also sold in large quantities to speculators, given away in great
        tracts for railroads and other purposes, until now the public domain
        of the United States, which a generation ago seemed illimitable, has
        practically gone. And this, as the experience of other countries shows,
        is the natural result in a growing community of making land private property.
        When the possession of land means the gain of unearned wealth, the strong
        and unscrupulous will secure it. But when, as we propose, economic rent,
        the &#8220;unearned increment of wealth,&#8221; is taken by the state
        for the use of the community, then land will pass into the hands of users
        and remain there, since no matter how great its value, its possession
        will be profitable only to users.</p>
      <p>As to private property in land having conduced to the peace and tranquillity
        of human life, it is not necessary more than to allude to the notorious
        fact that the struggle for land has been the prolific source of wars
        and of lawsuits, while it is the poverty engendered by private property
        in land that makes the prison and the workhouse the unfailing attributes
        of what we call Christian civilization.</p>
      <p>Your Holiness intimates that the Divine Law gives its sanction to the
        private ownership of land, quoting from Deuteronomy, &#8220;Thou shalt
        not covet thy neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his house, nor his field, nor
        his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything
        which is his.&#8221;</p>
      <p>If, as your Holiness conveys, this inclusion of the words, &#8220;nor
        his field,&#8221; is to be taken as sanctioning private property in land
        as it exists today, then, but with far greater force, must the words, &#8220;his
        man-servant, nor his maid-servant,&#8221; be taken to sanction chattel
        slavery; for it is evident from other provisions of the same code that
        these terms referred both to bondsmen for a term of years and to perpetual
        slaves. But the word &#8220;field&#8221; involves the idea of use and
        improvement, to which the right of possession and ownership does attach
        without recognition of property in the land itself. And that this reference
        to the &#8220;field&#8221; is not a sanction of private property in land
        as it exists today is proved by the fact that the Mosaic code expressly
        denied such unqualified ownership in land, and with the declaration, &#8220;the
        land also shall not be sold forever, because it is mine, and you are
        strangers and sojourners with me,&#8221; provided for its reversion every
        fiftieth year; thus, in a way adapted to the primitive industrial conditions
        of the time, securing to all of the chosen people a foothold in the soil.</p>
      <p>Nowhere in fact throughout the Scriptures can the slightest justification
        be found for the attaching to land of the same right of property that
        justly attaches to the things produced by labor. Everywhere is it treated
        as the free bounty of God, &#8220;the land which the Lord thy God giveth
        thee.&#8221; ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only
  upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon
  them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community,
  for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community.
  It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent
  is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality
  ordained by nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage over any
  other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence; and
  each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor
  get its full reward, and capital its natural return. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

to unity growing out of and ever balancing a centrifugal force tending to diversity.
Here is a fund belonging to society as a whole, from which without the degradation
of alms, private or public, provision can be made for the weak, the helpless,
the aged; from which provision can be made for the common wants of all as a matter

      <p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land values
        as the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British traditions.
        A land tax of four shillings in the pound of rental value is still nominally
        enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation made in the reign
        of William III, it amounts in reality to not much over a penny in the
        pound. With the abolition of indirect taxation this is the tax to which
        men would naturally turn. The resistance of landholders would bring up
        the question of title, and thus any movement which went so far as to
        propose the substitution of direct for indirect taxation must inevitably
        end in a demand for the restoration to the British people of their birthright. &#8212; <em>Protection

  THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the natural
  result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among whom equality and
  individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in theory at least, that
  the land belongs to society at large, not to the individual. Rude outcome of
  an age in which might stood for right as nearly as it ever can (for the idea
  of right is ineradicable from the human mind, and must in some shape show itself
  even in the association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted
  in no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was essentially
  a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign, theoretically
  the representative of the collective power and rights of the whole people,
  was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land. And though land was granted
  to individual possession, yet in its possession were involved duties, by which
  the enjoyer of its revenues was supposed to render back to the commonwealth
  an equivalent for the benefits which from the delegation of the common right
  he received. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

        saddled it on the people at large in the taxation of all consumers, has
        been long characterized, and is still held up in the law books, as a
        triumph of the spirit of freedom. Yet here is the source of the immense
        debt and heavy taxation of England. Had the form of these feudal dues
        been simply changed into one better adapted to the changed times, English
        wars need never have occasioned the incurring of debt to the amount of
        a single pound, and the labor and capital of England need not have been
        taxed a single farthing for the maintenance of a military establishment.
        All this would have come from rent, which the landholders since that
        time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from the tax which land
        ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital. The landholders
        of England got their land on terms which required them even in the sparse
        population of Norman days to put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand
        perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further condition of various
        fines and incidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent.
        It would probably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these
        various services and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had
        the landholders been kept to this contract and no land been permitted
        to be inclosed except upon similar terms, the income accruing to the
        nation from English land would today be greater by many millions than
        the entire public revenues of the United Kingdom. England today might
        have enjoyed absolute free trade. There need not have been a customs
        duty, an excise, license or income tax, yet all the present expenditures
        could be met, and a large surplus remain to be devoted to any purpose
        which would conduce to the comfort or well-being of the whole people. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

        Dan Sullivan: <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html">Are you a Real
          Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small>John Locke is often misrepresented
              by royal libertarians, who
        quote him very selectively. For example, Locke did say that:</small></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><small><i>Whatsoever then he
              removes out of the state that nature
              hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and
              joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his
          property.</i></small></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But Locke condemned anyone who
              took more than he needed as a
"spoiler of the commons":</small></p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>...if the fruits rotted, or
                the venison putrified,
                before he could spend it, he offended against the common law of nature,
                and was liable to be punished; he invaded his neighbour's share, for he
                had no right, farther than his use called for any of them, and they
          might serve to afford him conveniences of life. </i></small></div>
          <small> </small>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>The same measures governed
                the possession of land too:
                whatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use of, before it
                spoiled, that was his peculiar right; whatsoever he enclosed, and could
                feed, and make use of, the cattle and product was also his. But if
                either the grass of his enclosure rotted on the ground, or the fruit of
                his planting perished without gathering, and laying up, this part of
                the earth, notwithstanding his enclosure, was still to be looked on as
          waste, and might be the possession of any other. </i></small></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Locke also restricted
                appropriation of land by the proviso,
                ignored by royal libertarians, that there must be still enough, and
                as good left; and more than the yet unprovided could use. So that, in
                effect, there was never the less left for others because of his
                enclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another can make
          use of, does as good as take nothing at all.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now if the situation is that there
                  is enough free land, and as
                  good, left after you take and cultivate your land, than your land has
                  no market value, for who would pay you for land that is not better
                  than land that can be had for free? So, besides the fact that Locke's
                  justification of privatizing land is far more limited than royal
                  libertarians portray it to be, it is irrelevant to the question of
          land value tax, as it applies only to land that has no value.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, Locke based his
                  scenario on pre-monetary societies,
                  where a landholder would find that "it was useless, as well as
                  dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed."
        With the introduction of money, Locke noted, all land quickly became
                  appropriated. Why? Because with money, those who can take more land
                  than they have personal use for suddenly have reason to do so, as
                  between them they will have taken all the land, and others will
                  have to pay rent to them. So, with the introduction of money, the
                  Lockean rationale for landed property falls apart, even according to
      Locke.</small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And while Locke did not propose a
                      remedy specifically for to this
                      problem, he repeatedly stated that all taxes should be on real
          estate. ... <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html"><span

        Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech)</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One must start by looking at how
              the meaning of the word property
              has changed over the course of centuries. In most societies of the
              world, as was true in classic western thought, property typically
              meant personal property - clothing, household goods, bodily
              adornments and armor, and similar such items. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Land was typically
              owned by society in common, or perhaps belonged to God or nature.
              </span>Roman law made some effort to allot land titles to private
              individuals and families, but it was honored more in theory than in
              fact. Indeed, it was not until the now well-documented "<b>enclosure
              movement</b>" in early Tudor England that land titles began their
              long transformation from what has been termed "<b>leasehold</b>" to "<b>freehold</b>." Against
              the will of the King and his Council, noblemen seized the land for themselves,
              marking it into defined
              units, fenced off in their names only, even when they had no use for
              it. Karl Polanyi noted that: </small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enclosures have
                appropriately been called a revolution of the rich
                against the poor. The lords and nobles were upsetting the social
                order, breaking down ancient law and custom, sometimes by means of
                violence, often by pressure and intimidation. They were literally
                robbing the poor of their share in the common</span>, tearing down the
                houses which, by the hitherto unbreakable force of custom, the poor
                had long regarded as theirs and their heirs'. The fabric of society
                was being disrupted; desolate villages and the ruins of human
                dwellings testified to the fierceness with which the revolution
                raged, endangering the defenses of the country, wasting its towns,
                decimating its population, turning its overburdened soil into dust,
                harassing its people and turning them from decent husbandmen into a
                mob of beggars and thieves. </small><small>... <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Lastly, one must appreciate that
                the market value of &#8220;land&#8221; of every
                sort is entirely rent, as there is no human factor of labor that
                accounts for its origination. Services of nature have no prior cost to
                bring them into production existence &#8212; the electromagnetic spectrum,
                for example, exists regardless of human presence on earth and so
                presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy metals are
                all found in nature, not the result of human creation. They are, in
                19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor but of
                God&#8217;s. And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative on earth &#8212;
        the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as much as it was their
                role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of the land. That
                bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements, was an
                equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of rent
                collection and the exploitation of land without
                recognition of its price. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
                practice effectively ended with what in
                Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign,
                driving the peasants off the land into cities to provide cheap labor
                for the early English industrialists.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But
                the theory continued long afterwards. Georgists today argue that land
                rent should be collected from titleholders so that it is not left to
                render economic distortions. This in turn affects the price of labor
                and the price of money. Government&#8217;s role, whatever else it does, is at
                the very least responsible for defending the commons, to ascertain
                titles and to collect rent. Although there are many differences about
                the proper role, scope and domain of government among Georgist
                adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
                is central to its tenets. ... <a

      3.0 &#8212; Chapter 1: Time to Upgrade (pages 3-14)</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If you heard about the commons before you picked up this book, your
        impressions were probably shaped by a 1968 article called &#8220;The
        Tragedy of the Commons.&#8221; In that article, biologist Garrett Hardin
        used the metaphor of an unmanaged pasture to suggest a root cause of
        many planetary problems.</p>
      <p>The rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him
        to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. And another. . . . But
        this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing
        a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that
        compels him to increase his herd without limit &#8212; in a world that
        is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing
        his own best interest. . . . Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.</p>
      <p>Hardin&#8217;s notion of tragedy was taken from philosopher Alfred North
        Whitehead, who in turn drew upon Aristotle. According to Whitehead, the
        essence of tragedy is &#8220;the remorseless working of things.&#8221; In
        Hardin&#8217;s view, commons are fated to self-destruct. There&#8217;s
        nothing humans can do in the context of the commons to halt this inexorable
        outcome.</p>
      <p>Hardin was right about humanity&#8217;s unrelenting destruction of nature,
        but wrong about its cause and inexorability. He blamed the commons itself,
        when the true destroyer was, and remains, forces outside the commons.
        In Hardin&#8217;s hypothetical, the commons does nothing to protect itself
        against those forces. It&#8217;s completely unmanaged. But there&#8217;s
        no inherent reason why commons can&#8217;t be managed as commons.</p>
      <p>Contrary to the picture painted by Hardin, medieval European commons
        (which included not only pastures but forests and streams) were far from
        unmanaged. They had rules barring access to outsiders and limiting use
        by villagers. For example, a rule that persists today in many Swiss villages
        is that villagers can&#8217;t graze in common pasture more animals than
        they can feed over winter on their own land. A managed commons, in other
        words, isn&#8217;t inherently self-destructive. <strong>The real danger
        to the commons is enclosure and trespass by outsiders.</strong> ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    <blockquote>
      <p>        Enclosure, in which property rights are literally taken or given away,
          is half the reason for the commons&#8217; decline; the other half is
          a form of trespass called externalizing &#8212; that is, shifting costs
          to the commons. Externalizing is as relentless as enclosure, yet much
          less noticed, since it requires no active aid from politicians. It
          occurs quietly and continuously as corporations add illth to the commons
        without permission or payment.</p>
      <p>The one-two punch of enclosure and externalizing is especially potent.
        With one hand, corporations take valuable stuff from the commons and
        privatize it. With the other hand, they dump bad stuff into the commons
        and pay nothing. The result is profits for corporations but a steady
        loss of value for the commons. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    <blockquote>
      <p>So far I&#8217;ve focused on the commons of nature and community. In
        this chapter I explore the third fork of the commons river, culture.
        By this I mean the gifts of language, art, and science we inherit, plus
        the contributions we make as we live.</p>
      <p>Culture is a joint undertaking &#8212; a co-production &#8212; of individuals
        and society. The symphonies of Mozart, like the songs of Lennon and McCartney,
        are works of genius. But they also arise from the culture in which that
        genius lives. The instrumentation, the notation system, and the prevalent
        musical forms are the dough from which composers bake their cakes. So
        too with ideas. All thinkers and writers draw on stories and discoveries
        that have been developed by countless men and women before them. To paraphrase
        Isaac Newton, each generation sees a little farther because it stands
        on the shoulders of its predecessors. In this way, all new work draws
        from the commons and then enriches it. To keep art and science flourishing,
        we have to make sure the cultural commons is cared for.</p>
      <p>In addition, unlike most natural commons, the cultural commons is inexhaustible.
        Shakespeare&#8217;s plays can be &#8220;used&#8221; again and again without
        diminishing them. The same is true of Newton&#8217;s theories, Beethoven&#8217;s
        string quartets, and the information on the World Wide Web. Indeed, the
        more we use these assets, the more value they bestow. And thanks to technology &#8212; from
        Gutenberg&#8217;s press to Marconi&#8217;s radio to the globe-spanning
        Internet &#8212; sharing this wealth has become increasingly easy.</p>
      <p>Today, unfortunately, this cultural commons, like the commons of nature
        and community, is being enclosed by private corporations. The danger
        is that corporations will deplete the soil in which culture grows. The
        remedy is to reinvigorate the cultural commons. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
