<blockquote>
  <p>What we don't measure, we can't manage. What we don't measure properly, we
    can't make rational judgments about. The Consumer Price Index, believe it or
    not, does not take into account the huge appreciation of land when it calculates
    the cost of living. Instead, it uses a measurement related to the imputed rental
    value of a typical home. </p>
  <p>The cost of living for those who don't yet own a house is high, and rising.
    The human misery this creates is avoidable.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The steep increase in the level
of rentals represents a true and
accurate yardstick of our housing shortage. During the period 1950 to
1961</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the average rental rose from $71.13 per month to $186.79
or by
160%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>During the same period median urban family income rose
from
$3,497 to $5,924 or by only 69%.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></li>
  <li><small>Construction costs per square foot rose
from $8.68 in 1950 to $11.32 in 1961 or by only 30.4%.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The ever widening gap between
the level of rentals and the urban family income constitutes a rental
squeeze, which has brought untold misery and hardship to families in
the lower income group, especially to those belonging to minority
groups. The rental squeeze has also aggravated overcrowding and slum
conditions.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the
press, on the radio and on television we are often warned about the
threat of inflation. Hardly ever are we told, that the increase in the
cost of living is to a large extent due to the increase in housing
costs brought about by the housing shortage. The inflationary
effects of property taxation are reinforced by the fact that property
taxes themselves are included in the cost of living index and that
property tax rates have the tendency to rise. <small><small><big><big><a

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"><small><small>A Clarion Call to Sanity, to Honesty, to
Justice</small></small></a>&nbsp; (1982)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>.<small>.. </small></b><small>So
how
is it that on so richly endowed a Garden of Eden as this world of
ours we have only been able to make of it a hell on earth for vast
numbers of people?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The answers are simple: we have
permitted, nay we have even more
than that, encouraged, the gross misallocation of resources and a
viciously wicked distribution of wealth, and we choose to be governed
by those whom we, in our ignorance, have elected. As the principal
focus of this paper is on inflation, let us give this process its
full name which is fiat money inflation and let us define this as the
process by which a government continues the issuance of irredeemable
paper money until the quantity so issued finally renders it
worthless.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since the founding of our country,
there have only been two
first-class countries guilty of this process. The first of these
occurred in France in the late 1700's; the second was in Germany in
1923. In both, the results were devastating, and not limited to the
offending parties: World War II, for example, resulting directly from
the German inflation of 1923, and the rise to power of the madman
Hitler. When one recalls the horrors of both of these, one should be
dumbfounded at the insanity currently rampant throughout every single
so-called first class country in the world today.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The effects of inflation could be
accounted for in the words of
Edwin Kemmerer, who introduced his first lecture on the German
inflation of the early 1920's with the statement that, whereas money
must not be confused with wealth, it does serve three extremely
important functions: as a measure of wealth, as a medium for the
exchange of wealth, and as a storehouse of wealth. This was at the
start of a series of six lectures presented in the mid 1930's (for
$5.00) at the New School for Social Research in New York. The
disaster of inflation might best be described by a contemplation of
the destruction of this storehouse. Money in the bank today has a
specific worth; a year from now, it may be worth significantly
less.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A great American economist in the
field of money and banking, a
past president of the American Economics Association, Kemmerer taught
primarily at Princeton University. He emphasized the fact that
everyone in German suffered terribly, although mentioning the fact
that the landowners suffered the least. Before it ended in 1923, over
475 quintillion marks had been printed, and people were taking
wheelbarrows of them to market.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>We tend to think that the awful
inflations that affected
Germany and France in the past century couldn't happen here, that
"they" wouldn't let it. However, under the current paradigm of
economics, "they" have no control. </b>Politicians in power praise
the skills and the impact of the efforts of proponents first of
fiscal and then of monetarist policies, as if these two approaches
constituted the only two available solutions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They don't know any answer. We're
on a roller coaster which we
cannot stop and from which we cannot escape. The inevitability of the
terrible future that apparently lies ahead is so awesome that people
tend to bury their heads in the sand, taking the attitude that they
might as well enjoy the present because the future is so far out of
their control. Economists generally have not provided much reason to
do otherwise, and no one, including the general run of economists,
has come up with any hope of salvation, of rescue.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Suffice it to say that
history has shown inflation to produce
an outcome that an intelligently run economy should avoid at
virtually any cost. </b>The ultimate outcome of the inflationary
course we are now pursuing is the repudiation of the current money
system.

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now the public is paying for private parties.
        That is not fair.</span> Look at the economy. Take taxes off homes, and
        they become more affordable. Have some kind of land charge, and housing
        stock
        increases as sites get developed. Affordable housing helps stabilize
        neighborhoods. In places that do have the land tax, i.e., Australia and
        New Zealand, they
        have fewer disputes with assessment. Assessors say their job is so much
        easier now. If land is less profitable and less of a political football,
        it is less
        tense in local politics.&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you take taxes off labor and capital,
            more investment flows into jobs, and we would have close to full employment,
            so labor could demand full market value for services. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We could double the income of the average
            worker with no loss in standard of living.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li>If fewer demands are placed on government by citizens, it doesn't have
          to borrow so much. </li>
    <li>If you reduce the amount of tax on the economy, and reduce the amount
      of redeemable notes, then we should be able to eliminate inflation. It
      is unmasked.
          You can see lower prices; the cost of living goes down. It will change
      social relationships. </li>
    <li>Labor and capital make up, with higher wages for labor, lower taxes for
          capital, and more investment funds. </li>
    <li>Labor can negotiate from a position of strength. </li>
    <li>Capital might want to share management decisions and spread that risk
      of liability to workers. It tends to reduce hierarchy and increase equality
          in society.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <p>  What other social relations might change? Increase land ownership participation
    in community and it benefits community, with town hall meetings and block parties.
    Those kinds of communities have less crime. Pittsburgh has six times greater
    land tax than improvements, more affordable housing, and less
    crime.<br>
    <br>
    The main indicator of economic health is called the GDP. A good measure would
    be <span style="font-weight: bold;">leisure</span>, the amount of time off
    from labor to maintain a comfortable standard of living. If we shift, it
    would shrink
    the work week, and help get rid of rush
    hour traffic.&nbsp; ... <a href="docs/Smith_SRTS.html">read the whole article</a>
