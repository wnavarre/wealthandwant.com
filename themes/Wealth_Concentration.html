    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="style1">[16] </span>These dangers, which menace not one country alone, but modern civilization
        itself, do but show that a higher civilization is struggling to be born &#8212; that
        the needs and the aspirations of men have outgrown conditions and institutions
        that before sufficed.</p>
      <p><span class="style1">[17] </span><strong>A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth and power
          in the hands of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human machines,
        must inevitably evolve anarchy and bring destruction. </strong>But a civilization
        is possible in which the poorest could have all the comforts and conveniences
        now enjoyed by the rich; in which prisons and almshouses would be needless,
        and charitable societies unthought of. Such a civilization waits only
        for the social intelligence that will adapt means to ends. Powers that
        might give plenty to all are already in our hands. Though there is poverty
        and want, there is, yet, seeming embarrassment from the very excess of
        wealth-producing forces. &quot;Give us but a market,&quot; say manufacturers, &quot;and
        we will supply goods without end!&quot; &quot;Give us but work!&quot; cry
        idle men.</p>
      <p><span class="style1">[18] </span>The evils that begin to appear spring from the fact that the application
        of intelligence to social affairs has not kept pace with the application
        of intelligence to individual needs and material ends. Natural science
        strides forward, but political science lags. <strong>With all our progress
        in the arts which produce wealth, we have made no progress in securing
        its
        equitable distribution. </strong>Knowledge has vastly increased; industry and
        commerce have been revolutionized; but whether free trade or protection
        is best for a nation we are not yet agreed. We have brought machinery
        to a pitch of perfection that, fifty years ago, could not have been imagined;
        but, in the presence of political corruption, we seem as helpless as
        idiots. The East River bridge is a crowning triumph of mechanical skill;
        but to get it built a leading citizen of Brooklyn had to carry to New
        York sixty thousand dollars in a carpet bag to bribe New York aldermen.
        The human soul that thought out the great bridge is prisoned in a crazed
        and broken body that lies bedfast, and could watch it grow only by peering
        through a telescope. Nevertheless, the weight of the immense mass is
        estimated and adjusted for every inch. But the skill of the engineer
        could not prevent condemned wire being smuggled into the cable.</p>
      <p><span class="style1">[19] </span>The progress of civilization requires that more and more intelligence
        be devoted to social affairs, and this not the intelligence of the few,
        but that of the many. We cannot safely leave politics to politicians,
        or political economy to college professors. The people themselves must
        think, because the people alone can act.</p>
      <p><span class="style1">[20] </span>In a &quot;journal of civilization&quot; a professed teacher declares
        the saving word for society to be that each shall mind his own business.
        This is the gospel of selfishness, soothing as soft flutes to those who,
        having fared well themselves, think everybody should be satisfied. But
        the salvation of society, the hope for the free, full development of
        humanity, is in the gospel of brotherhood &#8212; the gospel of Christ.
        Social progress makes the well-being of all more and more the business
        of each; it binds all closer and closer together in bonds from which
        none can escape. He who observes the law and the proprieties, and cares
        for his family, yet takes no interest in the general weal, and gives
        no thought to those who are trodden under foot, save now and then to
        bestow aims, is not a true Christian. Nor is he a good citizen. The duty
        of the citizen is more and harder than this.</p>
      <p><span class="style1">[21] </span>The intelligence required for the solving of social problems is
        not a thing of the mere intellect. It must be animated with the religious
        sentiment and warm with sympathy for human suffering. It must stretch
        out beyond self-interest, whether it be the self-interest of the few
        or of the many. It must seek justice. For at the bottom of every social
        problem we will find a social wrong. <a href="../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">...

    <blockquote>
      <p> <span class="style1">[06] </span>Liberty is natural.  Primitive perceptions are of the equal rights of the citizen, and  political organization always starts from this base. It is as social  development goes on that we find power concentrating, in institutions  based upon the equality of rights passing into institutions which make  the many the slaves of the few. How this is we may see. In all  institutions which involve the lodgment of governing power there is,  with social growth, a tendency to the exaltation of their function and  the centralization of their power, and in the stronger of these  institutions a tendency to the absorption of the powers of the rest.  Thus the tendency of social growth is to make government the business  of a special class. And as numbers increase and the power and  importance of each become less and less as compared with that of all,  so, for this reason, does government tend to pass beyond the scrutiny  and control of the masses. The leader of a handful of warriors, or head  man of a little village, can command or govern only by common consent,  and anyone aggrieved can readily appeal to his fellows. But when a  tribe becomes a nation and the village expands to a populous country,  the powers of the chieftain, without formal addition, become  practically much greater. For with increase of numbers scrutiny of his  acts becomes more difficult, it is harder and harder successfully to  appeal from them, and the aggregate power which he directs becomes  irresistible as against individuals. And gradually, as power thus  concentrates, primitive ideas are lost, and the habit of thought grows  up which regards the masses as born but for the service of their rulers.<br>
        <br>
[08] But to the changes  produced by growth are, with us, added the changes brought about by  improved industrial methods. The tendency of steam and of machinery is  to the division of labor, to the concentration of wealth and power.  Workmen are becoming massed by hundreds and thousands in the employ of  single individuals and firms; small storekeepers and merchants are  becoming the clerks and salesmen of great business houses; we have  already corporations whose revenues and payrolls belittle those of the  greatest States. And with this concentration grows the facility of  combination among these great business interests. How readily the  railroad companies, the coal operators, the steel producers, even the  match manufacturers, combine, either to regulate prices or to use the  powers of government! The tendency in all branches of industry is to  the formation of rings against which the individual is helpless, and  which exert their power upon government whenever their interests may  thus be served.<br>
<br>
[09] It is not merely positively, but negatively, that great  aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to  corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of the  people. "Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars &mdash; except two  million dollars." Great wealth always supports the party in power, no  matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for reform, for it  instinctively fears change. It never struggles against misgovernment.  When threatened by the holders of political power it does not agitate,  nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is in this way, no less  than by its direct interference, that aggregated wealth corrupts  government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our organized lobbies,  both legislative and Congressional, rely as much upon the fears as upon  the hopes of moneyed interests. When "business" is dull, their resource  is to get up a bill which some moneyed interest will pay them to beat.  So, too, these large moneyed interests will subscribe to political  funds, on the principle of keeping on the right side of those in power,  just as the railroad companies deadhead President Arthur when he goes  to Florida to fish.<br>
<br>
[10] The more corrupt a government the easier wealth can use it. Where  legislation is to be bought, the rich make the laws; where justice is  to be purchased, the rich have the ear of the courts. And if, for this  reason, great wealth does not absolutely prefer corrupt government to  pure government, it becomes none the less a corrupting influence. A  community composed of very rich and very poor falls an easy prey to  whoever can seize power. The very poor have not spirit and intelligence  enough to resist; the very rich have too much at stake. </p>

    <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of
      Taxation</a> (1881 article)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
        distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between
        movables and immovables, between personal property and real estate. The
        true distinction is between property which is, and property which is
        not, the result of human labor; or, to use the terms of political economy,
        between land and wealth. For, in any precise use of the term, land is
        not wealth, any more than labor is wealth. Land and labor are the factors
        of production. Wealth is such result of their union as retains the capacity
        of ministering to human desire. A lot and the house which stands upon
        it are alike property, alike have a tangible value, and are alike classed
        as real estate. But there are between them the most essential differences.
        The one is the free gift of Nature, the other the result of human exertion;
        the one exists from generation to generation, while men come and go;
        the other is constantly tending to decay, and can only be preserved by
        continual exertion. To the one, the right of exclusive possession, which
        makes it individual property, can, like the right of property in slaves,
        be traced to nothing but municipal law; to the other, the right of exclusive
        property springs clearly from those natural relations which are among
        the primary perceptions of the human mind. Nor are these mere abstract
        distinctions. They are distinctions of the first importance in determining
        what should and what should not be taxed.</p>
      <p> For, keeping in mind the fact that all wealth is the result of human
        exertion, it is clearly seen that, having in view the promotion of the
        general prosperity, it is the height of absurdity to tax wealth for purposes
        of revenue while there remains, unexhausted by taxation, any value attaching
        to land. We may tax land values as much as we please, without in the
        slightest degree lessening the amount of land, or the capabilities of
        land, or the inducement to use land. But we cannot tax wealth without
        lessening the inducement to the production of wealth, and decreasing
        the amount of wealth. We might take the whole value of land in taxation,
        so as to make the ownership of land worth nothing, and the land would
        still remain, and be as useful as before. The effect would be to throw
        land open to users free of price, and thus to increase its capabilities,
        which are brought out by increased population. But impose anything like
        such taxation upon wealth, and the inducement to the production of wealth
        would be gone. Movable wealth would be hidden or carried off, immovable
        wealth would be suffered to go to decay, and where was prosperity would
        soon be the silence of desolation.</p>
      <p> And the reason of this difference is clear. The possession of wealth
        is the inducement to the exertion necessary to the production and maintenance
        of wealth. Men do not work for the pleasure of working, but to get the
        things their work will give them. And to tax the things that are produced
        by exertion is to lessen the inducement to exertion. But over and above
        the benefit to the possessor, which is the stimulating motive to the
        production of wealth, there is a benefit to the community, for no matter
        how selfish he may be, it is utterly impossible for any one to entirely
        keep to himself the benefit of any desirable thing he may possess. These
        diffused benefits when localized give value to land, and this may be
        taxed without in any wise diminishing the incentive to production. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
      <p>So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
        all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most
        prosperous which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the
        height of absurdity for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms.
        We should tax what we want to repress, not what we want to encourage.
        We should tax that which results from the general prosperity, not that
        which conduces to it. It is the increase of population, the extension
        of cultivation, the manufacture of goods, the building of houses and
        ships and railroads, the accumulation of capital, and the growth of commerce
        that add to the value of land &#8212; not the increase in the value of
        land that induces the increase of population and increase of wealth.
        It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now worth hundreds of
        millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers, it was only
        worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people, and so much
        more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and the increase
        of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased. Increase
        of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
        And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
        does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
        it. It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose
        that lays it.</p>
      <p> Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion.
        The tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes.
        It does not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with
        the utmost ease and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs
        of production; and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and
        the highest justice. <strong>For, to take for the common purposes of
        the community that value which results from the growth of the community,
        and to free
        industry and enterprise and thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave
        to each that which he fairly earns, and to assert the first and most
        comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the equal right of all to the land
        on which, and from which, all must live.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest
        production is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and
        that in the proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility
        of enormously increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these
        pressing social and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality
        in the distribution of wealth.</strong></p>
      <p>&quot;There is,&quot; says M. de Laveleye, in concluding that work in
        which he shows that the first perceptions of mankind have everywhere
        recognized a most vital distinction between property in land and property
        which results from labor, &#8212; &quot;there is in human affairs one
        system which is the best; it is not that system which always exists,
        otherwise why should we desire to change it; but it is that system which
        should exist for the greatest good of humanity. God knows it, and wills
        it; man's duty it is to discover and establish it.&quot; ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read

            and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest
            court of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right
            of discovery, nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money,

      <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
        of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
        chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to
        go upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much
        will they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use
        and not to hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents
        the full difference between its productiveness and the productiveness
        of the next best. <strong>But if the first-comers, reasoning that the next best
        land will soon be scarce and theirs will then rise in value, refuse to
        sell or to rent at that valuation, the newcomers must resort to land
        of the second grade, though the best be as yet only partly used. Consequently
        land of the first grade commands Rent before it otherwise would.</strong></p>
      <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
        be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
        of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart
        may be made to show it: [chart]</p>
      <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land
        in securing more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor
        force, a rush is made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that
        it is wanted, but to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their
        own pockets as soon as growing demand for land makes it valuable.101
        We may, for illustration, suppose that all the remainder of the second
        space and the whole of the third are thus appropriated, and note the
        effect: [chart]</p>
      <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is
        no increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for
        higher prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning
        lots in the moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But
        let more land be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different
        appearance. The new labor must either go to the space that yields but
        1, or buy or rent from owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect
        would be the same in any case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor
        force would get more than 1; the surplus of products would go to landowners
        as Rent, either directly in rent payments, or indirectly through lower
        Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical
            or continuous payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But
            actual or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized
            for the purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling
            value that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
            will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether
            Rent is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will
            be the capitalization of its present or prospective power of producing
            Rent. In fact, much the larger proportion of laud that has a selling
            value is wholly or partly unused, producing no Rent at all, or less
            than it would if fully used. This condition is expressed in the chart
            by the blue color.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial
            'discounted' value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford,

            including those of collecting the rents, and on the other for its
            mineral wealth, its capabilities of development for any kind of business,
            and its advantages, material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes
            of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec.
            9.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a
            certain number of times the current money rental, or in other words,
            a certain 'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things
            being equal, it will be the higher the more important these direct
            gratifications are, as well as the greater the chance that they and
            the money income afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id.,
            note.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality
            inhering in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession
            of a thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it
            or for its use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is
            purely relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining
            things for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to
            value, for nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying
            some physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or
            whim. But utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves
            the reason of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things
            having some form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not
            valuable, as they are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further,
            we may see that with most of the things that have value this difficulty
            or ease of getting them, which determines value, depends on the amount
            of labor which must be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing
            them into the place, form and condition in which they are desired.
            . . Value is simply an expression of the labor required for the production
            of such a thing. But there are some things as to which this is not
            so clear. Land is not produced by labor, yet land, irrespective of
            any improvements that labor has made on it, often has value. . .
            Yet a little examination will show that such facts are but exemplifications
            of the general principle, just as the rise of a balloon and the fall
            of a stone both exemplify the universal law of gravitation. . . The
            value of everything produced by labor, from a pound of chalk or a
            paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances of a first-class
            ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent of the
            labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while the
            value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
            of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of
            the labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to
            obtain or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential
        Rent. Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space,
        but the owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor
        Wages is actually produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
      <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
        with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
        of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space
        above the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system
        which confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative
        purposes becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they
        would if land were appropriated only for use.</p>
      <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have
        as yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before
        (page 73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given
        expenditure of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when
        applied to the next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the
        poorest. Labor would not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when
        on page 73 we illustrated the appropriation of land for use only, although
        much less land is actually used. The prizes which expectation of future
        social growth dangles before men as the rewards of owning land, would
        raise demand so as to make it more than ever difficult to get land. All
        of the fourth grade would be taken up in expectation of future demand;
        and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded out to the open space
        that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence of increased
        labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
        yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages
        would then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space.
        Thus: [chart]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country
            have so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man,

            iv, ch. iv, as follows :</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard

              a drink, pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and
              traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point
              where land can be had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry
              or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the
        least that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward
        movement of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall
        below 1; but neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive
        power may increase, so long as it pays to hold land for higher values.
        Some laborers would continually be pushed back to land which increased
        productive power would have brought up in productiveness from 0 to 1,
        and by perpetual competition for work would so regulate the labor market
        that the given expenditure of labor force, however much it produced,
        could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this tendency would
        persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite increase
        in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without increase
        of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers to
        increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
        again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
        until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
        be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political
            Economy,&quot; book ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements
            in agricultural implements which diminish the expense of cultivation,
            that they do not increase the profits of the farmer or the wages
            of his laborers, but that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition
            to the rent already paid to him, all that is saved in the expense
            of cultivation.&quot; This is true not alone of improvements in agriculture,
            but also of improvements in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
            the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies,
            cannot limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a
            fixed quantity, which human agency can neither increase nor diminish;
            but there is nevertheless a limit to the price of land, in the minimum
            required by labor and capital as the condition of engaging in production.
            If it were possible to continuously reduce wages until zero were
            reached, it would be possible to continuously increase rent until
            it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot be permanently
            reduced below the point at which laborers will consent to work and
            reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital will be
            devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
            advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to
            advance rent in countries where wages and interest are already near
            the minimum, as in countries where they are considerably above it.
            Yet that there is in all progressive countries a constant tendency
            in the speculative advance of rent to overpass the limit where production
            would cease, is, I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial
            paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>

      <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
        are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing
        unused land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry.
        Thus increase of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and
        depression of Rent, co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But
        no sooner do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land
        set in, Rent rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly
        reappear. The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent
        higher and Wages lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent or land
            values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial depression
            is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the relation of
            cause and effect, is obvious to whoever considers the necessary relation
            between land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book
            v, ch. i.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach
            a point at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there
            is a downward tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living,
            which is the same thing) in all departments of labor and with all
            grades of laborers. This tendency continues until the fictitious
            values of land give way. So long as the tendency is felt only by
            that class which is hired for wages, it is poverty merely; when the
            same tendency is felt by the class of labor that is distinguished
            as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it is &quot;hard
            times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical because land
            values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set it, and by
            rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
            again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
            much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
            power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>

      <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates
        Rent from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
        is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
        continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should,
        actually generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase
        of productive power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated,
        tend to even greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues:
        for individuals suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.

      return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade of grass
                  or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
      to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. Material progress cannot
                  rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power
      of producing wealth from land; and hence, when land is monopolized,
                  it might go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving
                  the condition of those who have but their labor. It can but
      add to the value of land and the power which its possession gives. Everywhere,
                  in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is
      the base
                of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the source
      of power. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read the whole

      <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference
                of all public burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully
                appreciated until we consider the effect upon the distribution of
              wealth. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which
                appears in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater
                and greater inequality as material progress goes on, we have found
                it in the fact that, as civilization advances, the ownership of land,
                now in private hands, gives a greater and greater power of appropriating
                the wealth produced by labor and capital.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and
                indirect, and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as
                it went, to counteract this tendency to inequality, and, if it went
                so far as to take in taxation the whole of rent, the cause of inequality
                would be totally destroyed. Rent, instead of causing inequality,
                as now, would then promote equality. Labor and capital would then
                receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the state
                in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
                would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be
                divided into two portions.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between
                      individual producers, according to the part each had taken in the
                      work of production;</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
                      in public benefits to all its members.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong,
                young children and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the
                blind, as well as the vigorous. And justly so &#8212; for while
                one part represents the result of individual effort in production,
                the
                other represents the increased power with which the community
                as a whole aids the individual.</p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken
                by the community for common purposes the very cause which now tends

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of
                        land, all landholders are likely to take the alarm, and there
                        will not be wanting appeals to the fears of small farm and homestead
                        owners, who will be told that this is a proposition to rob them
                        of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will
                        show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose
                        interests as landholders do not largely exceed their interests
                        as laborers or capitalists, or both. And further consideration
                        will show that though the large landholders may lose relatively,
                        yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For, the
                        increase in production will be so great that labor and capital
                        will gain very much more than will be lost to private landownership,
                        while in these gains, and in the greater ones involved in a more
                        healthy social condition, the whole community, including the
                      landowners themselves, will share.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;"> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will
                          greatly benefit all those who live by wages, whether of hand
                          or of head -- laborers, operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional
                          men of all sorts.</div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;"> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who
                          live partly by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital
                          -- storekeepers, merchants, manufacturers, employing or undertaking
                          producers and exchangers of all sorts from the peddler or drayman
                          to the railroad or steamship owner -- and</div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;"> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes
                          of those whose incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital.</div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Take, now, the case of the homestead owner -- the mechanic,
                    storekeeper, or professional man who has secured himself a house
                    and lot, where he lives, and which he contemplates with satisfaction
                    as a place from which his family cannot be ejected in case of
                    his death. He will not be injured; on the contrary, he will be
                    the gainer. ...</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">... In short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist,
                    as well as a landowner, and it is by his labor and capital that
                    his living is made. His loss would be nominal; his gain would
                    be real and great. In varying degrees is this true of all landholders.
                    Many landholders are laborers of one sort or another. This measure
                    would make no one poorer but such as could be made a great deal
                    poorer without being really hurt. It would cut down great fortunes,
                  but it would impoverish no one.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Wealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally
                    distributed. I do not mean that each individual would get the
                    same amount of wealth. That would not be equal distribution,
                    so long as different individuals have different powers and different
                    desires. But I mean that wealth would be distributed in accordance
                    with the degree in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence
                    of each contributed to the common stock. The great cause which
                    concentrates wealth in the hands of those who do not produce,
                    and takes it from the hands of those who do, would be gone. The
                    inequalities that continued to exist would be those of nature,
                    not the artificial inequalities produced by the denial of natural
                    law. The nonproducer would no longer roll in luxury while the
                    producer got but the barest necessities of animal existence.

                            and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of

                            the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow

        mass all the infinite diversities of being and beauty, so is liberty
                                to mankind. It is not for an abstraction that
        men have toiled and died; that in every age the witnesses of Liberty
                                have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty
        have suffered.</p>

                            is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries.

                          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If Adam, when he got out of
                            Eden, had sat down and commenced to
                            pray, he might have prayed till this time without getting anything to
                            eat unless he went to work for it. Yet food is God&#8217;s bounty. He
                            does not bring meat and vegetables all prepared. What He gives are
                            the opportunities of producing these things &#8212; of bringing them
                            forth by labour. His mandate is &#8212; it is written in the Holy
                            Word, it is graven on every fact in nature &#8212; that by labour we
                            shall bring forth these things. Nature gives to labour and to nothing
                          else. </small></div>
                          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What God gives are the natural
                            elements that are indispensable
                            to labour. He gives them, not to one, not to some, not to one
                            generation, but to all. They are His gifts, His bounty to the whole
                            human race. And yet in all our civilised countries what do we see?
                            That a few people have appropriated these bounties, claiming them as
                            theirs alone, while the great majority have no legal right to apply
                            their labour to the reservoirs of Nature and draw from the
                          Creator&#8217;s bounty. </small></p>
                          <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small> Thus it
                            happens that all over the civilised world that class
                            that is called peculiarly &#8216;the labouring class&#8217; is the poor
                            class, and that people who do no labour, who pride themselves on
                            never having done honest labour, and on being descended from fathers
                            and grandfathers who never did a stroke of honest labour in their
                            lives, revel in a superabundance of the things that labour brings
                          forth.&nbsp; ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

                          <p>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean; imagine a little world swimming in space.
                              Put on it, in imagination, human beings. Let them divide the land, share
                              and share alike, as individual property. At first, while population is sparse
                          and industrial processes rude and primitive, this will work well enough.</p>
                          <p>Turn away the eyes of the mind for a moment, let time pass, and look again.
                              Some families will have died out, some have greatly multiplied; on the whole,
                              population will have largely increased, and even supposing there have been
                              no important inventions or improvements in the productive arts, the increase
                              in population, by causing the division of labor, will have made industry
                              more complex. During this time some of these people will have been careless,
                              generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some of
                              them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how they themselves
                              and the things they see around them came to be, to inquiries and speculations
                              as to what there is in the universe beyond their little island or their little
                              world, to making poems, painting pictures, or writing books; to noting the
                              differences in rocks and trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts
                              and birds and fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the
                              many things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
                              happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others again will
                              have devoted all their energies to the extending of their possessions. What,
                              then, shall we see, land having been all this time treated as private property?
                              Clearly, we shall see that the primitive equality has given way to inequality.
                              Some will have very much more than one of the original shares into which
                              the land was divided; very many will have no land at all. Suppose that, in
                              all things save this, our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that
                              there are no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
                              taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency; imagine,
                              if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is utterly abolished;
                              yet inequality in the ownership of land will have produced poverty and virtual
                          slavery.</p>
                          <p>For the people we have supposed are human beings &#8211; that is to say,
                              in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can live only on
                              land and by the aid of the products of land. They may make machines which
                              will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps to fly in the air, but to
                              build and equip these machines they must have land and the products of land,
                              and must constantly come back to land. Therefore those who own the land must
                              be the masters of the rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land,
                              he is their absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the
                              land only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
                              land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as his ownership
                          is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in everything as he wills.</p>
                          <p>If, however, the concentration of landownership has not gone so far as to
                              make one or a very few men the owners of all the land &#8211; if there are
                              still so many landowners that there is competition between them as well as
                              between those who have only their labor &#8211; then the terms on which these
                              non-landholders can live will seem more like free contract. But it will not
                              be free contract. Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor;
                              labor can produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
                              factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary factors
                              of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts as to how the
                              results of production are divided, the possessors of these two meet on equal
                              terms. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For the nature of these two factors
                              is very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have his
                              stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but labor cannot
                              exist without land.</span> If I own a piece of land, I can let it lie idle
                              for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But the laborer must eat every day, and his family
                              must eat. And so, in the making of terms between them, the landowner has
                              an immense advantage over the laborer. It is on the side of the laborer that
                              the intense pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
                              urged by hunger.</span> And, further than this: As population increases,
                              as the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
                              are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a larger
                              and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it produces. That
                              is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this steady rise in the
                              value of land brings about a confident expectation of future increase of
                              value, which produces among landowners all the effects of a combination to
                              hold for higher prices. Thus there is a constant tendency to force mere laborers
                              to take less and less or to give more and more (put it which way you please,
                              it amounts to the same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity
                              to work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our little
                              island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some of the people
                              would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all the fruits of labor
                              without doing any labor at all, while others would be forced to work the
                          livelong day for a pitiful living.</p>
                          <p><strong>But let us introduce another element into the supposition. Let us
                                suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the steam-engine,
                                the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the reaping-machine, and the thousand
                                and one labor-saving
                          devices that are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</strong></p>
                          <p><strong>Manifestly, the effect of all such discoveries and inventions is
                                to increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the same amount
                              of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater amount with the same
                              labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen the necessity for land. Until
                              we can discover some way of making something out of nothing &#8211; and that
                              is so far beyond our powers as to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there
                              is no possible discovery or invention which can lessen the dependence of
                              labor upon land. And, this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving
                              devices, land being the private property of some, would simply be to increase
                              the proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for the
                              use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and inventions
                          would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more dependent.</strong></p>
                          <p>And, since we are imagining conditions, imagine laborsaving inventions to
                              go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to perfection. What
                              then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done away with, all the wealth
                              that the land could produce would go entire to the landowners. None of it
                              whatever could be claimed by any one else. For the laborers there would be
                              no use at all. If they continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers
                          on the bounty of the landowners! ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

                        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I doubt not that whichever way a
                            man may turn to inquire of
                            Nature, he will come upon adjustments which will arouse not merely
                            his wonder, but his gratitude. Yet what has most impressed me with
                            the feeling that the laws of Nature are the laws of beneficent
                            intelligence is what I see of the social possibilities involved in
                            the law of rent. Rent <font size="-2"><small><b><i>(4)</i></b></small></font>
                        springs from natural causes. It arises, as society develops, from the
                            differences in natural opportunities and the differences in the
                            distribution of population. It increases with the division of labor,
                            with the advance of the arts, with the progress of invention. And
                            thus, by virtue of a law impressed upon the very nature of things,
                            has the Creator provided that the natural advance of mankind shall be
                            an advance toward equality, an advance toward cooperation, an advance
                            toward a social state in which not even the weakest need be crowded
                            to the wall, in which even for the unfortunate and the cripple there
                            may be ample provision. For this revenue, which arises from the
                            common property, which represents not the creation of value by the
                            individual, but the creation by the community as a whole, which
                            increases just as society develops, affords a common fund, which,
                            properly used, tends constantly to equalize conditions, to open the
                            largest opportunities for all, and utterly to banish want or the fear
                          of want.</small></div>

                            in the heart of our civilization,
                            the vice and crime and degradation and ravening greed that flow from
                            it, are the results of a treatment of land that ignores the simple
                            law of justice, a law so clear and plain that it is universally
                            recognized by the veriest savages. What is by nature the common
                            birthright of all, we have made the exclusive property of
                            individuals; what is by natural law the common fund, from which
                            common wants should be met, we give to a few that they may lord it
                            over their fellows. And so some are gorged while some go hungry, and
                          more is wasted than would suffice to keep all in luxury.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have here abolished all
                            hereditary privileges and legal
                            distinctions of class. Monarchy, aristocracy, prelacy, we have swept
                            them all away. We have carried mere political democracy to its
                            ultimate. Every child born in the United States may aspire to be
                            President. Every man, even though he be a tramp or a pauper, has a
                            vote, and one man's vote counts for as much as any other man's vote.
                            Before the law all citizens are absolutely equal. In the name of the
                            people all laws run. They are the source of all power, the fountain
                            of all honor. In their name and by their will all government is
                            carried on; the highest officials are but their servants.
                            Primogeniture and entail we have abolished wherever they existed. We
                            have and have had free trade in land. We started with something
                            infinitely better than any scheme of peasant proprietorship which it
                            is possible to carry into effect in Great Britain. We have had for
                            our public domain the best part of an immense continent. We have had
                            the preemption law and the homestead law. It has been our boast that
                            here every one who wished it could have a farm. We have had full
                            liberty of speech and of the press. We have not merely common
                            schools, but high schools and universities, open to all who may
                            choose to attend. Yet here the same social difficulties apparent on
                            the other side of the Atlantic are beginning to appear. It is already
                            clear that our democracy is a vain pretense, our make-believe of
                            equality a sham and a fraud.

                            Mikados of Japan. The shadow of power is theirs; but the substance of
                            power is being grasped and wielded by the bandit chiefs of the stock
                            exchange, the robber leaders who organize politics into machines. In
                            any matter in which they are interested, the little finger of the
                            great corporations is thicker than the loins of the people. Is it
                            sovereign States or is it railroad corporations that are really
                            represented in the elective Senate which we have substituted for an
                            hereditary House of Lords? Where is the count or marquis or duke in
                            Europe who wields such power as is wielded by such simple citizens as
                            our Stanfords, Goulds, and Vanderbilts? What does legal equality
                            amount to, when the fortunes of some citizens can be estimated only
                            in hundreds of millions, and other citizens have nothing? What does
                            the suffrage amount to when, under threat of discharge from
                            employment, citizens can be forced to vote as their employers
                            dictate? when votes can be bought on election day for a few dollars
                            apiece? If there are citizens so dependent that they must vote as
                            their employers wish, so poor that a few dollars on election day seem
                            to them more than any higher consideration, then giving them votes
                            simply adds to the political power of wealth, and universal suffrage
                            becomes the surest basis for the establishment of tyranny. "Tyranny"!
                            There is a lesson in the very word. What are our American bosses but
                            the exact antitypes of the Greek tyrants, from whom the word comes?
                            They who gave the word tyrant its meaning did not claim to rule by
                            right divine. They were simply the Grand Sachems of Greek Tammanys,

                          <p><small>The truth is, that the
                            completion of the railroad and the consequent great increase of
                            business and population, will not be a benefit to all of us, but only
                            to a portion. As a general rule (liable of course to exceptions) those
                            who have it will make wealthier; for those who have not, it will make
                            it more difficult to get. Those who have lands, mines, established
                            businesses, special abilities of certain kinds, will become richer for
                            it and find increased opportunities; those who have only their own
                            labor will be come poorer, and find it harder to get ahead -- first,
                            because it will take more capital to buy land or to get into business;
                            and second, because as competition reduces the wages of labor, this
                            capital will be harder for them to obtain.</small><br>
                            <br>
                            <small>What, for instance, does the rise in land mean? Several things,
                            but certainly and prominently this: that it will be harder in future
                            for a poor man to get a farm or a homestead lot. In some sections of
                            the State, land which twelve months ago could have been had for a
                            dollar an acre, cannot now be had for less than fifteen dollars. In
                            other words, the settler who last year might have had at once a farm of
                            his own, must now either go to work on wages for some one else, pay
                            rent or buy on time; in either case being compelled to give to the
                            capitalist a large proportion of the earnings which, had he arrived a
                            year ago, he might have had all for of himself. And as proprietorship
                            is thus rendered more difficult and less profitable to the poor, more
                            are forced into the labor market to compete with each other, and cut
                            down the rate of wages -- that is, to make the division of their joint
                            production between labor and capital more in favor of capital and less
                            in favor of labor.</small><br>
                            <br>
                            <small>And so in San Francisco the rise in building lots means, that it
                            will be harder for a poor man to get a house and lot for himself, and
                            if he has none that he will have to use more of his earnings for rent;
                            means a crowding of the poorer classes together; signifies courts,
                            slums, tenement-houses, squalor and vice.</small><br>
                            <br>
                            <small>San Francisco has one great advantage -- there is probably a
                            larger proportion of her population owning homesteads and homestead
                            lots than in any other city of the United States. The product of the
                            rise of real estate will thus be more evenly distributed, and the great
                            social and political advantages of this diffused proprietorship cannot
                            be over-estimated. Nor can it be too much regretted that the princely
                            domain which San Francisco inherited as the successor of the pueblo was
                            not appropriated to furnishing free, or almost free, homesteads to
                            actual settlers, instead of being allowed to pass into the hands of a
                            few, to make more millionaires. Had the matter been taken up in time
                            and in a proper spirit, this disposition might easily have been
                            secured, and the great city of the future would have had a population
                            bound to her by the strongest ties-a population better, freer, more
                            virtuous, independent and public spirited than any great city the world
                            has ever had.</small><br>
                            <small><br>
                            To say that "Power is constantly stealing from the many
                            to the few," is only to state in another form the law that wealth tends
                            to concentration. In the new era into which the world has entered since
                            the application of steam, this law is more potent than ever; in the new
                            era into which California is entering, its operations will be more
                            marked here than ever before. The locomotive is a great centralizer. It
                            kills towns and builds up great cities, and in the same way kills
                            little businesses and builds up great ones. We have had comparatively
                            but few rich men; no very rich ones, in the meaning "very rich" has in
                            these times. But the process is going on. The great city that is to be
                            will have its Astors, Vanderbilts, Stewarts and Spragues, and he who
                            looks a few years ahead may even now read their names as he passes
                            along Montgomery, California or Front streets.&nbsp; With the
                            protection which property gets in modern times -- with stocks, bonds,
                            burglar-proof safes and policemen; with the railroad and the telegraph,
                            after a man gets a certain amount of money it is plain sailing, and he
                            need take no risks. Astor said that to get his first thousand dollars
                            was his toughest struggle; but when one gets a million, if he has
                            ordinary prudence, how much he will have is only a question of life.
                            Nor can we rely on the absence of laws of primogeniture and entail to
                            dissipate these large fortunes so menacing to the general weal. Any
                            large fortune will, of course, become dissipated in time, even in spite
                            of laws of primogeniture and entail; but every aggregation of wealth
                            implies and necessitates others, and so that the aggregations remain,
                            it matters little in what particular hands. Stewart, in the natural
                            course of things, will die before long, and being childless, his wealth
                            will be dissipated, or at least go out of the dry goods business. But
                            will this avail the smaller dealers whom he has crushed or is crushing
                            out? Not at all. Some one else will step in, take his place in the
                            trade, and run the great money-making machine which he has organized,
                            or some other similar one. Stewart and other great houses have
                            concentrated the business, and it will remain concentrated.</small><br>
                            <br>
                            <small>Nor is it worth while to shut our eyes to the effects of this
                            concentration of wealth. One millionaire involves the little existence
                            of just so many proletarians. It is the great tree and the saplings
                            over again. We need not look far from the palace to find the hovel. </small><br>
                            <br>
                            <small>When people can charter special steamboats to take them to
                            watering places, pay four thousand dollars for the summer rental of a
                            cottage, build marble stables for their horses, and give dinner parties
                            which cost by the thousand dollars a head, we may know that there are
                            poor girls on the streets pondering between starvation and
                            dishonor.&nbsp; </small><br>

                            <small>When liveries appear, look out for bare-footed children. A few
                            liveries are now to be seen on our streets; we think their appearance
                            coincides in date with the establishment of the almshouse. They are
                            few, plain and modest now; they will grow more numerous and gaudy --
                          and then we will not wait long for the children -- their corollaries.</small>      </p>
                          <p><small>But there is another side: we are to become a great, populous,
                                wealthy community. And in such a community many good things are
                                possible that are not possible in a community such as ours has been.
                                There have been artists, scholars, and men of special knowledge and
                                ability among us, who could and some of whom have since won distinction
                                and wealth in older and larger cities, but who here could only make a
                                living by digging sand, peddling vegetables, or washing dishes in
                                restaurants. It will not be so in the San Francisco of the future. We
                                shall keep such men with us, and reward them, instead of driving them
                                away. We shall have our noble charities, great museums, libraries and
                                universities; a class of men who have leisure for thought and culture;
                                magnificent theatres and opera houses; parks and pleasure gardens. ...</small><br>
                            <br>
                            <small>The same law of concentration will work in other businesses in
                                the
                                same way. The railroads may benefit Sacramento and Stockton by making
                                of them workshops, but no one will stop there to buy goods when he
                                can go to San Francisco, make his choice from larger stocks, and
                            return the same day.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
                            <br>
                            <small>That we can look forward to any political improvement is, to say
                                the least, doubtful. There is nothing in the changes which are coming
                                that of itself promises that. There will be a more permanent
                                population, more who will look on California as their home; but we
                                would not aver that there will be a larger proportion of the population
                                who will take an intelligent interest in public affairs. In San
                                Francisco the political future is full of danger. As surely as San
                                Francisco is destined to become as large as New York, as certain is it
                                that her political condition is destined to become as bad as that of
                                New York, unless her citizens are aroused in time to the necessity of
                                preventive or rather palliative measures. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">And in the growth of large corporations and
                                other special interests is an element of great danger. Of these great
                                corporations and interests we shall have many. </span>Look, for
                                instance, at the Central Pacific Railroad Company, as it will be, with
                                a line running to Salt Lake, controlling more capital and employing
                                more men than any of the great eastern railroads who manage
                                legislatures as they manage their workshops, and name governors,
                                senators and judges almost as they name their own engineers clerks! Can
                                we rely upon sufficient intelligence, independence and virtue among the
                                many to resist the political effects of the concentration of great
                            wealth in the hands of a few?</small><br>
                            <br>
                            <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">And this in general is the
                                tendency of the time, and of the new era opening before us: to the
                                great development of wealth; to concentration; to the differentiation
                                of classes; to less personal independence among the many and the
                                greater power of the few. </span>We shall lose much which gave a charm
                                to California life; much that was valuable in the character of our
                                people, while we will also wear off defects, and gain some things that
                            we lacked.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
                            <br>
                            <small>And as California becomes populous rich, let us not forget that
                                the character of a people counts for more than their numbers; that
                                the distribution of wealth is even a more important matter than its
                                production. Let us not imagine ourselves in a fools' paradise, where
                                the golden apples will drop into our mouths; let us not think that
                                after the stormy seas and head gales of all the ages, our ship has at
                                last struck the trade winds of time. The future of our State, of our
                                nation, of our race, looks fair and bright; perhaps the future looked
                                so to the philosophers who once sat in the porches of Athens -- to the
                                unremembered men who raised the cities whose ruins lie south of us.
                                Our modern civilization strikes broad and deep and looks high. So did
                          the tower which men once built almost unto heaven. ...<a

                ingenuity to devise any way by which the evils born of the injustice
                that robs men of their birthright can be removed otherwise than by

                taken, and on which he must draw for all that he can produce &#8211; does it
                not irresistibly follow that to give the land in ownership to some men

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">It is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the average of
      comfort, leisure, and refinement has been raised; but
    these gains are not general. In
    them the lowest class do not share.* I do not mean that the condition of the
    lowest class has nowhere nor in anything been improved; but that there is nowhere
    any improvement which can be credited to increased productive
    power. <B>I mean that the tendency of what we call material progress is in no
    wise to improve the condition of the lowest class in the essentials of healthy,
    happy human life.</B> Nay, more, that it is to still further depress the condition
    of the lowest class. <B>The new forces, elevating in their nature though they
    be, do not act upon the social fabric from underneath, as was for a long time
    hoped and
    believed, but strike it at a point intermediate between top and
    bottom.</B> It is as though an immense wedge were being forced, not underneath
    society, but through society. Those who are above the point of separation are
    elevated, but those who are below are crushed
    down. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"><B>So long as all the increased wealth which modern progress brings goes but
          to build up great fortunes, to increase luxury and make sharper the contrast
          between the House of Have and the House of Want, progress is not real and
          cannot be permanent.</B> The reaction must come. The tower leans from its
          foundations, and every new story but hastens the final catastrophe. To educate
          men who must be condemned to poverty, is but to make them restive; to base
          on a state of most glaring social inequality political institutions under
          which
      men are not fully equal, is to stand a pyramid on its apex. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">I propose in the following pages to attempt to solve by the methods of political
      economy the great problem I have outlined. <B>I propose to seek the law which
      associates poverty with progress, and increases want with advancing wealth;
      and I believe that in the explanation of this paradox we shall find the explanation
      of those recurring seasons of industrial and commercial paralysis which, viewed
      independent of their relations to more general phenomena, seem
    so inexplicable.</B> Properly commenced and carefully pursued, such an investigation
    must yield a conclusion that will stand every test, and as truth will correlate
    with all other truth. For in the sequence of phenomena there is no accident.
    Every effect has a cause, and
    every fact implies a preceding fact.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">That political economy, as at present taught, does not explain the persistence
      of poverty amid advancing wealth in a manner which accords with the deep-seated

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">that, on the contrary, after a century of cultivation, during which it
            has engrossed the attention some of the most subtle and powerful intellects,
            it should be spurned by the statesman, scouted by the masses, relegated in
            the opinion of many educated and thinking men to the rank of a pseudo-science
            in which nothing fixed or can be fixed--must, it seems to me, be due not
            to any inability of the science when properly pursued, but some false step
            in its premises, or overlooked factor in its estimates. And as such mistakes
            are generally concealed the respect paid to authority, I propose in this
            inquiry take nothing for granted, but to bring even accepted theories to
            the test of first principles, and should they not stand the test, to freshly
            interrogate facts in the endeavor to discover their law.</div>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">I propose to beg no question, to shrink from no conclusion, but to follow
      truth wherever it may lead. Upon us the responsibility of seeking the law,
      for in the very heart of our civilization to-day women faint and little children
      moan. But what that law may prove to be is not our affair. <B>If the conclusions
      that we reach run counter to our prejudices, let us not flinch; if they challenge

        Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Or, to state the same thing in another way: Land being necessary to
        life and labor, its owners will be able, in return for permission to
        use it, to obtain from mere laborers all that labor can produce, save
        enough to enable such of them to maintain life as are wanted by the landowners
        and their dependents.</p>
      <p>Thus, <strong>where private property in land has divided society into
          a landowning class and a landless class</strong>, there is no possible
          invention or improvement, whether it be industrial, social or moral,
          which, so long as it does
        not affect the ownership of land, can prevent poverty or relieve the
        general conditions of mere laborers. For whether the effect of any invention
        or improvement be to increase what labor can produce or to decrease what
        is required to support the laborer,<strong> it can, so soon as it becomes
        general, result only in increasing the income of the owners of land</strong>,
        without at all benefiting the mere laborers. In no event can those possessed
        of
        the mere ordinary power to labor, a power utterly useless without the
        means necessary to labor, keep more of their earnings than enough to
        enable them to live. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
      <p>You assume that the labor question is a question between wage-workers
        and their employers. But working for wages is not the primary or exclusive
        occupation of labor. Primarily men work for themselves without the intervention
        of an employer. And the primary source of wages is in the earnings of
        labor, the man who works for himself and consumes his own products receiving
        his wages in the fruits of his labor. Are not fishermen, boatmen, cab-drivers,
        peddlers, working farmers &#8212; all, in short, of the many workers
        who get their wages directly by the sale of their services or products
        without the medium of an employer, as much laborers as those who work
        for the specific wages of an employer? In your consideration of remedies
        you do not seem even to have thought of them. Yet in reality the laborers
        who work for themselves are the first to be considered, since what men
        will be willing to accept from employers depends manifestly on what they
        can get by working for themselves.</p>
      <p>You assume that all employers are rich men, who might raise wages much
        higher were they not so grasping. But is it not the fact that the great
        majority of employers are in reality as much pressed by competition as
        their workmen, many of them constantly on the verge of failure? Such
        employers could not possibly raise the wages they pay, however they might
        wish to, unless all others were compelled to do so.</p>
      <p>You assume that there are in the natural order two classes, the rich
        and the poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.</p>
      <p>It is true as you say that there are differences in capacity, in diligence,
        in health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
        however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor.
        The natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not greater
        than are natural differences in stature. But while it is only by selecting
        giants and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as others, yet in
        the difference between rich and poor that exists today we find some men
        richer than other men by the thousandfold and the millionfold.</p>
      <p><strong>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide
          with differences in individual powers and aptitudes. The real difference
          between
        rich and poor is the difference between those who hold the tollgates
        and those who pay toll; between tribute-receivers and tribute-yielders. </strong>... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

      <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had
        the pleasure of making her acquaintance, because she lives in a lunatic
        asylum, which does not happen
              to be on my visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent

        twenty

        part of the income, which cannot be spent by the woman, is piling up
        at compound

              the most desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because
              of anything these owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they

              because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But
              it seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community
              was going to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not
              in any way useful to the community. The man may have planted trees, or
              built roads, and put in sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work,
              and for that he should be paid. But should he be paid for guessing what
              the rest of us were going to need?</p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences
        of this guessing game. The consequences of land speculation are tenantry
        and debt on the farms, and
              slums and luxury in the cities. A great part of the necessary land
        is held out of use, and so the value of all land continually increases,
        until the
              poor man can no longer own a home. The value of farm land also
        increases; so year by year more independent farmers are dispossessed,
        because
        they cannot pay interest on their mortgages. So the land becomes a place
        of
              serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where wealth accumulates
              and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering slums,
              and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous
              fortunes, which
              they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities,
        are enormously wealthy families, living on hereditary incomes derived
        from crowded slums. Here and there
              among these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned
        what he is consuming, and that it has not brought him happiness, and
        is bringing
              still less to his children. Such men are casting about for ways
        to invest
              their money without breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them

          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent a
            potentially important source of public
            revenue, the tax on land is a means of limiting excessive speculation
            in land prices. This would ensure that the equal opportunity to be
            productive would be available to all citizens. With limited money to
            invest, people could invest in productive equipment and wages, rather
            than in high land prices which produce no additional tangible
            wealth.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><br>
            <br>
            <small><b>THE SOURCE OF PUBLIC
            REVENUE </b></small><br>
            <small>What are the factors that cause land to have market value and to
            whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
          market value for three reasons: </small></div>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
          productivity of the soil and natural resources, 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>the publicly provided
          services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
          value of land and 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>the growth of communities and peoples' competitive
          demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that people
            and businesses are willing to
            pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
            period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
            location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
            travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
            businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
          day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
            be used as revenue, by the
            community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
            individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
            site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
            have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
          for the period of time.</small></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>ENVIRONMENTAL
            PRESERVATION </b></small><br>
            <small>It is the responsibility of the local communities to insure that
            the market rent of land is collected for public purposes. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">When a
            major part of land rent is not collected, which is the case in most
            of the world today, land title holders obtain rights to sell the
            value of the public improvements which were made by the whole
            community. </span>The community added to the market value to land by
            making
            improvements which increases demand and rent for the land. The longer
            the possessors hold the land out of use the greater will be the bonus
            they obtain.
        </small></div>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By prohibiting people from using
            good land, the possessors force
            the premature use of other less desirable land, which is more distant
            from the city. This raises the cost of community improvements and the
            rental value of the unused, but better located, land. This
            precipitates the degradation of the rural environment by using city
            land inefficiently -- and creates huge unnecessary pressures on the
          natural environment. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><small></small></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>As new inventions and
            more efficient ways of producing goods are
            discovered, people's economic well-being is not improved, because
            they have lost access to land and must pay both rent and taxes. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)</span></small>
            Instead of rent being used to provide community services, capital and
            wages must be depleted, which obstructs private enterprise.
            When the rent of land is taken for public purposes production and
            distribution are not held back. This is because the same amount of
            rent would otherwise have been taken by some private individual. The
            rent would be the same, the difference is how it is utilized. There
            is evidence that communities who raise their revenue from land,
            rather than from labor and capital, are more prosperous, many
            increasing productivity by more than 25%.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small><b>HOW MUCH LAND RENT
            SHOULD THE COMMUNITY COLLECT? </b></small><br>
            <small>In order to preserve the environment, it is necessary and
            possible
            to better utilize our communities. If the producers of the land
            market value (nature, government and people) don't utilize land rent,
            someone else will. This is why efficient land use fails under
            contemporary land systems in most countries. All countries collect
            some of the land rent, perhaps 10%, 20% or 30%, but none yet, collect
            all of the market rent of land.</small>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Studies have been produced that
            demonstrate that communities
            prosper and succeed in proportion to the percentage of the land rent
            that they collect. The first communities that decide to collect all
            of the ground rent will have an enormous competitive advantage over
            all other communities. They will be able to reduce or eliminate
            regressive taxes on labor and capital. They will attract new business
          and industry and become prosperous.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>To determine how much land rent
            the community should collect
            let's consider the alternatives. Whatever is not collected will be
            capitalized into market value by land owners. Buying land at inflated
            market prices is a block to new industry. Land owners sell the
            capitalized land rent (known as land value) which is uncollected by
            the community even though it is unearned income. This causes a
            disparity between landowners and non-landowners. In the United States
            5% of the population, which does not include many homeowners or
            farmers, own 70% of the total national land and natural resource
          values.</b></small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>People will come to a well run
            community because they will be
            better off than living by themselves or in an impoverished locale. A
            city must secure revenue in order to provide good quality
          services.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This revenue can best be procured
            when the community recaptures
            the value of the benefits and services that it provides. This is done
            by collecting the rental revenue from land that reflects the value of
            the services and facilities provided in that community. The land rent
            belongs equally to all people that live in the locale who helped to
            produce that value. In a well run community, there is sufficient land
            rent to provide adequate funding for the social purposes requested
          of, and provided by, the local city government</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cities which choose to collect
            land rent as their primary source
            of revenue have the advantage of not requiring burdensome taxes to be
            paid by workers, businesspeople, entrepreneurs or citizens.
            Individuals who work to create wealth should be allowed to keep what
            they produce. When labor is not taxed, greater production and
            consumption occurs. Investment capital is formed which is used to
            produce more wealth. New jobs are created and economic diversity
          results.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Each person has a right to keep
            what he or she produces, but no
            one has the right to waste what belongs to all people, the land which
            includes the natural environment. Each person should have an
            opportunity to use the best land for his business or personal needs,
            as long as they are willing to pay the land rent that other land
            users are willing to pay.&nbsp; ... <a

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most economists deem it their
        business to evaluate the efficiency
        of policy choices, but, claiming no special knowledge of ethics, they
        leave it to philosophers and the political process to evaluate
        questions of justice. Can it be true that society's arrangements to
        provide for common needs must always confront a divisive choice
        between equity and efficiency - between what is fair and what is
        feasible?</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George not only denied it;
        he asserted the reverse: <b>Full
        recognition of economic rights and responsibilities would reveal the
        goals of equity and efficiency to be mutually reinforcing. Neither
        social justice nor a well-functioning free market system can long be
        enjoyed without the other.</b> "The laws of the universe are
        harmonious," George proclaimed. His analysis showed that <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the root
        cause of widening inequality lies not in the laws of nature, but in
        social maladjustments which ignore them.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Moreover, the breach of
        justice which underlies the problem of poverty is not merely
        incidental to economic development; it impedes development, leading
        to wider and wider inequality.</span></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George emphasized that unequal
        distribution is itself wasteful of
        wealth.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Unemployment and underemployment
        of labor mean that energy and
        intelligence go untapped. For those who find work, he said, high
        wages stimulate creativity, invention, and improvement, while low
        wages encourage carelessness. Inadequate education of the poor
        multiplies the loss. There are the damages done by poverty-related
        vice and crime, and the substantial costs of protecting society
        against them. There is the burden upon the wealthy of providing
        welfare support for the very poor - or risking social upheaval if
        they do not. Moreover, said George, social institutions by which some
        prosper at others' expense cause talent and resources to be diverted
        from productive enterprise to unproductive conflict, as individuals
        find that competing for political advantage can be more lucrative
        than competing for market success.</small></p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In short, an
        unjust system of privileges and entitlements tends to
        cause misallocation of resources, macroeconomic instability and
        stagnation, political corruption, and social conflict that ultimately
        may threaten whole civilizations.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>George's central contribution
        was to show that the distinction
        between individual property and common property forms a rational
        basis for distinguishing the domain of public activity from that of
        the private.</b> This distinction leads him to a theory of public
        finance that reconciles the competing insights of socialism and
        laissez-faire capitalism. By a simple fiscal device, the revenue
        arising from common property can be captured for the public treasury
        and applied to the common benefit, so that government may assume
        needed general functions without interfering with individual
        incentives. </small></p>

        </small></a><small>(1883)</small><br>
        </small>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A civilization which tends to
        concentrate wealth and power in
        the hands of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human
        machines, must inevitably evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But a
        civilization is possible in which the poorest could have all the
        comforts and conveniences now enjoyed by the rich; in which prisons
        and almshouses would be needless, and charitable societies unthought
        of. Such a civilization waits only for the social intelligence that
        will adapt means to ends. Powers that might give plenty to all are
        already in our hands. Though there is poverty and want, there is,
        yet, seeming embarrassment from the very excess of wealth-producing
        forces. "Give us but a market," say manufacturers, "and we will
        supply goods without end!" "Give us but work!" cry idle men.<strong>...</strong></small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The progress of civilization
        requires that more and more
        intelligence be devoted to social affairs, and this not the
        intelligence of the few, but that of the many. We cannot safely leave
        politics to politicians, or political economy to college professors.
        The people themselves must think, because the people alone can act.
        </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> In a "journal of civilization" a
        professed teacher declares
        the saving word for society to be that each shall mind his own
        business. This is the gospel of selfishness, soothing as soft flutes
        to those who, having fared well themselves, think everybody should be
        satisfied. But the salvation of society, the hope for the free, full
        development of humanity, is in the gospel of brotherhood -- the gospel
        of Christ. Social progress makes the well-being of all more and more
        the business of each; it 'binds all closer and closer together in
        bonds from which none can escape. He who observes the law and the
        proprieties, and cares for his family, yet takes no interest in the
        general weal, and gives no thought to those who are trodden under
        foot, save now and then to bestow alms, is not a true Christian. Nor
        is he a good citizen. The duty of the citizen is more and harder than
        this.<strong> . . .</strong></small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The mere growth of society
        involves danger of the gradual
        conversion of government into something independent of and beyond the
        people, and the gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling
        class -- though not necessarily a class marked off by personal titles
        and a hereditary status, for, as history shows, personal titles and
        hereditary status do not accompany the concentration of power, but
        follow it.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
        <br>
        <small> But to the changes produced by growth are, with us, added the
        changes brought about by improved industrial methods.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It is not merely positively, but
        negatively, that great
        aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to
        corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of
        the people. "Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars -- except
        two million dollars." Great wealth always supports the party in
        power, no matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for
        reform, for it instinctively fears change. It never struggles against
        misgovemment. When threatened by the holders of political power it
        does not agitate, nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is
        in this way, no less than by its direct interference, that aggregated
        wealth corrupts government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our
        organized lobbies, both legislative and Congressional, rely as much
        upon the fears as upon the hopes of moneyed interests. When
"business" is dull, their resource is to get up a bill which some
        moneyed interest will pay them to beat. So, too, these large moneyed
        interests will subscribe to political funds, on the principle of
        keeping on the right side of those in power, just as the railroad
        companies deadhead [transport for free] President
        [Chester A.] Arthur when he goes to Florida to fish. </small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The more corrupt a government
        the easier wealth can use it.
        Where legislation is to be bought, the rich make the laws; where
        justice is to be purchased, the rich have the ear of the courts. And
        if, for this reason, great wealth does not absolutely prefer corrupt
        government to pure government, it becomes none the less a corrupting
        influence. A community composed of very rich and very poor falls an
        easy prey to whoever can seize power. The very poor have not spirit
        and intelligence enough to resist; the very rich have too much at
        stake.</small><br>

        <small><b>Developments in
        America</b>
        </small><br>
        <small> The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the
        aggregation of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations,
        necessarily
        implies, the loss by the people of governmental control. Democratic
        forms may be maintained, but there can be as much tyranny and
        misgovemment under democratic forms as any other -- in fact, they lend
        themselves most readily to tyranny and misgovernment. Forms count for
        little. The Romans expelled their kings, and continued to abhor the
        very name of king. But under the name of Caesars and Imperators, that
        at first meant no more than our "Boss," they crouched before tyrants
        more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of
"bosses," developed political Caesars in municipalities and states.
        If this development continues, in time there will come a national
        boss. We are young; but we are growing. The day may arrive when the
"Boss of America" will be to the modem world what Caesar was to the
        Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic government in
        more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
        something like equality-where the great mass of citizens are
        personally free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty
        nor made subject by their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in
        a property qualification. The man who is dependent on a master for
        his living is not a free man. To give the suffrage to slaves is only
        to give votes to their owners. That universal suffrage may add to,
        instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we see when
        mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
        without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the
        freedom to vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican
        institutions be secured. How can a man be said to have a country
        where he has no right to a square inch of soil; where he has nothing
        but his hands, and, urged by starvation, must bid against his fellows
        for the privilege of using them? When it comes to voting tramps, some
        principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme. I
        have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the
        almshouse to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the
        interest of good government. </small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Beneath all political problems
        lies the social problem of the
        distribution of wealth. This our people do not generally recognize,
        and they listen to quacks who propose to cure the symptoms without
        touching the disease. "Let us elect good men to office," say the
        quacks. Yes; let us catch little birds by sprinkling salt on their
        tails! </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It behooves us to look facts in
        the face. The experiment of
        popular government in the United States is clearly a failure. Not
        that it is a failure everywhere and in everything. An experiment of
        this kind does not have to be fully worked out to be proved a
        failure. But speaking generally of the whole country, from the
        Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, our
        government by the people has in large degree become, is in larger
        degree becoming, government by the strong and unscrupulous.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That he who produces should have,
        that he who saves should
        enjoy, is consistent with human reason and with the natural order.
        But existing inequalities of wealth cannot be justified on this
        ground. As a matter of fact, how many great fortunes can be
        truthfully said to have been fairly earned? How many of them
        represent wealth produced by their possessors or those from whom
        their present possessors derived them? Did there not go to the
        formation of all of them something more than superior industry and
        skill? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Such qualities may give the
        first start, but when fortunes
        begin to roll up into millions there will always be found some
        element of monopoly, some appropriation of wealth produced by others.
        </span>Often mere is a total absence of superior industry, skill or
        self-denial, and merely better luck or greater unscrupulousness. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Sources of Great
        Wealth</b>&nbsp;
        </small><br>
        <small> An acquaintance of mine died in San Francisco recently,
        leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in
        England. I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more
        temperate than he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This
        man did not get his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He
        no more produced it than did those lucky relations in England who may
        now do nothing for the rest of their lives. He became rich by getting
        hold of a piece of land in the early days, which, as San Francisco
        grew, became very valuable. His wealth represented not what he had
        earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of the earth's surface
        enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the
        other day, leaving $3,000,000.
        He may or may not have been particularly industrious, skilful and
        economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that he got
        so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby
        through a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against
        the pauper labor of Europe," gave him the advantage of a
        sixty-per-cent, tariff. To the day of his death he was a stanch
        protectionist, and said free trade would ruin our "infant
        industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to lay by
        from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
        what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by
        the tariff that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's
        earnings.</small></p>
        <center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Beneath all political
        problems lies the social problem of
        the distribution of wealth."</small></center>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element
        of monopoly, of appropriation and spoliation
        will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account for
        all great fortunes....</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt
        fortune. The first Vanderbilt was a
        boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it. But it was not
        working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
        fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money
        enough he used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He
        ran off opposition lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel.
        Then he went into railroads, pursuing the same tactics. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The
        Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working and saving than did the
        fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</span></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune.
        Mr. Gould might have got his
        first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial. But
        it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions.
        It was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures,
        getting up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock
        values and transportation rates. </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great
        fortunes which the Pacific
        railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
        profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations
        of Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by
        monopolizing and gouging. And so of fortunes made by such
        combinations as the Standard Oil Company, the Bessemer Steel Ring,
        the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and the various rings
        for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper labor of
        Europe." </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of
        successful patents. Like that
        element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased value of
        land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I am
        not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
        in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make
        fortunes out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and,
        in fact, through nearly all
        acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes, these
        elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
        of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me
        recently, "It is not on our ordinary business that we make our money;
        it is where we can get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally
        true.
        </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I am not denouncing the rich, nor
        seeking, by speaking of
        these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get a clear
        understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that it
        is due <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/SP/concentrations_of_wealth_harm.html"></a></small></p>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>that some men are enabled to get

        enormously rich while others remain so miserably poor. I<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">f we look
        around us and note the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation
        which go to the building up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see
        on the one hand now disingenuous are those who preach to us that
        there is nothing wrong in social relations and that the inequalities
        in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities of human
        nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk as
        though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
        restricting the acquisition of wealth. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital
        is a good; the
        capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely
        let any one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in
        doing so.</span></span> There are deep wrongs in the present
        constitution of society,
        but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in
        those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are
        the laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from
        bad
        adjustments which it is within our power to amend. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The ideal social
        state is not that in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but
        in which each gets in proportion to his contribution to the general
        stock. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">And in such a social
        state there would not be less incentive
        to exertion than now; there would be far more incentive.</span> Men
        will be
        more industrious and more moral, better workmen and better citizens,
        if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his family, than
        where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them until
        some have far more than they could have earned, and others have
        little or nothing.

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Somehow he did manage to live. By one means
      or another he got over the peak of his greatest distress, and four years
      later, in the winter of 1868,
            he came from California to New York on an errand for a newspaper.
      He was then not quite thirty years old, and did not even yet have a dollar
      in
            his pocket that he could call his own. New York showed him something
      brand-new in his experience. Up to this time he had not been in a position
      to see
            any great show of inequality in the distribution of wealth. Life
      was simple in the Philadelphia of his boyhood days, and in the rough and
      new California
            of his youth one person lived much like another. But now, in the
      New York of 1868, he saw our western Palmyra in all the shoddy glory of
      its post-war
            period, and by all accounts it must have been a most dreadful sight,
      as repulsive as the pens of Dickens and George William Curtis pictured
      it.
            Shoddy riches, shoddy show, shoddy ideals and taste, shoddy people &#8212; and
            on the other hand, whole populations of troglodyte slum-dwellers
            living at an almost inconceivable depth of wretchedness and degradation.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Years afterward George said that here &#8220;I saw and recognized for
            the first time the shocking contrast between monstrous wealth and debasing
            want.&#8221; What was the cause of it? Again, nobody seemed to know.
            Like depressions and plagues, it was taken as part of the regular
            order of nature.
            It had always existed in large commercial and industrial centers,
            apparently it was bound always to exist, and it seemed to be just
            another one of the
            things that had to be put up with. There was no cure for it, so far
            as anybody knew. All that could be done was to take some of the curse
            off
            it by charity of one sort or another, and this was being done; in
            fact, it was beginning to be organized on a large scale, more lavishly
            perhaps
            than in any other country.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Nevertheless, George reasoned with himself, the thing had to have a cause,
            for nothing in nature ever happens without a cause. If that cause could
            be found, a cure might be found; but trying to deal with an effect without
            knowing anything about its cause would be mere fumbling in the dark. Here,
            then, was a second question, to which George pledged his lifetime for an
            answer. <strong>The first question was, what is the cause &#8212; not any
            superficial and apparent cause, but the true fundamental cause &#8212; of
            recurrent industrial depressions? The second question was, what is the
            true fundamental cause of the enormous inequality in the distribution of
            wealth?</strong></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">George succeeded in answering these two questions to his own satisfaction
            while he was still a comparatively young man. This was the only success
            he ever had in his life; whatever else he touched failed. His one success,
            however, such as it was, led him through one of the strangest and most
            remarkable careers ever achieved in America, or for that matter, in the
            world. ... </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"><em>Progress and Poverty</em> is the first
      and only thorough, complete, scientific inquiry ever made into the fundamental
      cause of industrial depressions
            and involuntary poverty. The ablest minds of the century attacked
      and condemned it &#8212; Professor Huxley, the Duke of Argyll, Goldwin
      Smith, Leo XIII, Frederic Harrison, John Bright, Joseph Chamberlain. Nevertheless,
      in a
            preface to the definitive edition, George said what very few authors
      of a technical work have ever been able to say, that he had not met with
      a
            single criticism or objection that was not fully anticipated and
      answered in the book itself. For years he debated its basic positions with
      any one
            who cared to try, and was never worsted.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">... Much more important, however, is the question
      whether George&#8217;s
            faith in the common man&#8217;s collective judgment was justified; whether
            such faith is ever justified. Does the common man possess the force of
            intellect to apprehend the processes of reason correctly, or the force
            of character to follow them disinterestedly? The whole future of eighteenth-century
            political doctrine, the doctrine on which our republic was nominally established,
            hangs on this question &#8212; the question, in short, whether republicanism
            has not put a burden on the common man which is greater than he can
            bear.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">George never had a moment&#8217;s doubt of
      the answer. Yet, seeing what sort of political leadership the common man
      invariably chose to follow,
            and the kind of issue that invariably attracted him, he ended the
      argument of <em>Progress and Poverty</em> with a clear warning, too long
      to be quoted here, against the wholesale corruption of the common man by
      the government
            which the common man himself sets up. It is well worth reading now,
      whether one finds the root of this corruption in the common man&#8217;s weakness
            of mind and character, or whether one finds it, as George did, in the unequal
            distribution of wealth. Whatever one may think about that, there is no
            possible doubt that George&#8217;s warning has the interest of absolutely
            accurate prophecy. ...<a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">read the whole article</a></div>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day,
          while riding horseback in the Oakland
          hills, merchant seaman and journalist Henry George had <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a startling epiphany. He realized that
          speculation and private profiteering in the gifts of nature were the
          root causes of the unjust distribution of wealth.</span> The insights
          presented in <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>,
          George's masterwork, launched him to fame. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">His policy
          approach was known at that time as the "single tax" - meaning that
          taxation should be shifted off of labor and onto the socially created
          surplus value of land and other natural resources.</span> His message
          reached as far as the great Russian Leo Tolstoy, who was so taken with
          the idea that he frequently referred to George and "Georgism" in his
          novel Resurrection.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the last 20 years of the 19th century
          George
          built an impressive populist movement bent on solving the problem of
          the wealth gap, and he died in 1897 while campaigning to be New York's
          mayor. The "Georgists" were determined to free labor and all productive
          effort from the burden of taxation. Land and natural resources were
          gifts of nature to be fairly shared by all. The role of government
          would be to secure democratic rights to the earth for all people via
          the collection of resource rents, the surplus value accruing to natural
          wealth, which would be distributed in social goods, services or by

          <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">But just as
          this
          solution to the rich/poor gap was gaining momentum, the Georgist
          movement was stopped in its tracks. Wealthy individuals poured their
          money into leading schools of economics to encourage the writing of
          treatises against George and the movements he had spawned. </span>The
          ethical perspective that land is a common heritage and the policy
          approach of land value taxation were subsequently eliminated from the
          field of economics. The newly dominant theory focused on only two
          primary factors -- labor and capital -- with capital having the upper
          hand as "employing labor." "Labor," of course, is quite capable of
          self-employment given access to land. This is what the elites and the
          plutocrats feared most - that labor would gain full power to directly
          produce capital given conditions of equal rights to the resources of
          the earth. ...&nbsp;</small>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive
            term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property, of
            which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your
            meaning, if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous.
            But reading it as a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention
            that private property in land shall be understood when you speak
            merely of private property. With this interpretation, I find that
            the reasons you urge for private property in land are eight. Let
            us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
          <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.
            (RN, paragraph 5) ...<br>
            2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of
            reason. (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
            3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land.
            (RN, paragraph 8.) ...<br>
            4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself.
            (RN, paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
            5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
            of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that
            it is sanctioned by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
            6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private
            property in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs
            14-17.) ...<br>
            7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases
            wealth, and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph
            51.) ...<br>
            8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature,
            not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that
            to take the value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and
            cruel to the private owner. (RN, paragraph 51.)</p>
          <p><strong><br>
  1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.</strong>              (5.)*</p>
          <p>Clearly, purchase and sale cannot give, but can only transfer ownership.
            Property that in itself has no moral sanction does not obtain moral
            sanction by passing from seller to buyer.</p>
          <p>If right reason does not make the slave the property of the slave-hunter
            it does not make him the property of the slave-buyer. Yet your reasoning
            as to private property in land would as well justify property in
            slaves. To show this it is only needful to change in your argument
            the word land to the word slave. It would then read:</p>
          <p>It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative
            labor, the very reason and motive of his work is to obtain property,
            and to hold it as his own private possession.</p>
          <p>If one man hires out to another his strength or his industry, he
            does this for the purpose of receiving in return what is necessary
            for food and living; he thereby expressly proposes to acquire a full
            and legal right, not only to the remuneration, but also to the disposal
            of that remuneration as he pleases.</p>
          <p>Thus, if he lives sparingly, saves money, and invests his savings,
            for greater security, in a slave, the slave in such a case is only
            his wages in another form; and consequently, a working-man&#8217;s
            slave thus purchased should be as completely at his own disposal
            as the wages he receives for his labor.</p>
          <p>Nor in turning your argument for private property in land into an
            argument for private property in men am I doing a new thing. In my
            own country, in my own time, this very argument, that purchase gave
            ownership, was the common defense of slavery. It was made by statesmen,
            by jurists, by clergymen, by bishops; it was accepted over the whole
            country by the great mass of the people. By it was justified the
            separation of wives from husbands, of children from parents, the
            compelling of labor, the appropriation of its fruits, the buying
            and selling of Christians by Christians. In language almost identical
            with yours it was asked, &#8220;Here is a poor man who has worked
            hard, lived sparingly, and invested his savings in a few slaves.
            Would you rob him of his earnings by liberating those slaves?&#8221; Or
            it was said: &#8220;Here is a poor widow; all her husband has been
            able to leave her is a few negroes, the earnings of his hard toil.
            Would you rob the widow and the orphan by freeing these negroes?&#8221; And
            because of this perversion of reason, this confounding of unjust
            property rights with just property rights, this acceptance of man&#8217;s
            law as though it were God&#8217;s law, there came on our nation a
            judgment of fire and blood.</p>
          <p>The error of our people in thinking that what in itself was not
            rightfully property could become rightful property by purchase and
            sale is the same error into which your Holiness falls. It is not
            merely formally the same; it is essentially the same. Private property
            in land, no less than private property in slaves, is a violation
            of the true rights of property. They are different forms of the same
            robbery; twin devices by which the perverted ingenuity of man has
            sought to enable the strong and the cunning to escape God&#8217;s
            requirement of labor by forcing it on others.</p>
          <p>What difference does it make whether I merely own the land on which
            another man must live or own the man himself? Am I not in the one
            case as much his master as in the other? Can I not compel him to
            work for me? Can I not take to myself as much of the fruits of his
            labor; as fully dictate his actions? Have I not over him the power
            of life and death?</p>
          <p>For to deprive a man of land is as certainly to kill him as to deprive
            him of blood by opening his veins, or of air by tightening a halter
            around his neck.</p>
          <p>The essence of slavery is in empowering one man to obtain the labor
            of another without recompense. Private property in land does this
            as fully as chattel slavery. The slave-owner must leave to the slave
            enough of his earnings to enable him to live. Are there not in so-called
            free countries great bodies of working-men who get no more? How much
            more of the fruits of their toil do the agricultural laborers of
            Italy and England get than did the slaves of our Southern States?
            Did not private property in land permit the landowner of Europe in
            ruder times to demand the jus primae noctis? Does not the same last
            outrage exist today in diffused form in the immorality born of monstrous
            wealth on the one hand and ghastly poverty on the other?</p>
          <p>In what did the slavery of Russia consist but in giving to the master
            land on which the serf was forced to live? When an Ivan or a Catherine
            enriched their favorites with the labor of others they did not give
            men, they gave land. And when the appropriation of land has gone
            so far that no free land remains to which the landless man may turn,
            then without further violence the more insidious form of labor robbery
            involved in private property in land takes the place of chattel slavery,
            because more economical and convenient. For under it the slave does
            not have to be caught or held, or to be fed when not needed. He comes
            of himself, begging the privilege of serving, and when no longer
            wanted can be discharged. The lash is unnecessary; hunger is as efficacious.
            This is why the Norman conquerors of England and the English conquerors
            of Ireland did not divide up the people, but divided the land. This
            is why European slave-ships took their cargoes to the New World,
            not to Europe.</p>
          <p>Slavery is not yet abolished. Though in all Christian countries
            its ruder form has now gone, it still exists in the heart of our
            civilization in more insidious form, and is increasing. There is
            work to be done for the glory of God and the liberty of man by other
            soldiers of the cross than those warrior monks whom, with the blessing
            of your Holiness, Cardinal Lavigerie is sending into the Sahara.
            Yet, your Encyclical employs in defense of one form of slavery the
            same fallacies that the apologists for chattel slavery used in defense
            of the other!</p>
          <p>The Arabs are not wanting in acumen. Your Encyclical reaches far.
            What shall your warrior monks say, if when at the muzzle of their
            rifles they demand of some Arab slave-merchant his miserable caravan,
            he shall declare that he bought them with his savings, and producing
            a copy of your Encyclical, shall prove by your reasoning that his
            slaves are consequently &#8220;only his wages in another form,&#8221; and
            ask if they who bear your blessing and own your authority propose
            to &#8220;deprive him of the liberty of disposing of his wages and
            thus of all hope and possibility of increasing his stock and bettering
            his condition in life&#8221;? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
          wealth gap is increasing in the
          US. According to the latest Federal Reserve data, the top 1% of the
          population has $2 trillion more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Perceptions of the causal factors of these statistics and the
          suffering
          of so many who lack basic necessities in this wealthy country are most
          often simplistic explanations - these people lack money and they lack
          money because they lack jobs or their wages are too low, or housing
          costs are too high. For those concerned about the growing wealth gap in
          America and worldwide, and the resultant poverty, homelessness, hunger
          and food insecurity, the dilemma usually bogs down into supply or
          demand side efforts to find solutions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">But the root cause is a
          deeper injustice.</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The primary cause of the
          enormous and
          growing wealth gap is that the land and natural resources of the earth
          are treated as if they are mere market commodities from which a few are
          allowed to reap massive private profits or hold land and resources out
          of use in anticipation of future profits. </span>Henry George, the
          great 19th century American political economist and social philosopher,
          proposed a solution to a problem that too few understood at the time
          and too few understand today. Early Christian teachings drew upon deep
          wisdom teachings of the Jubilee justice tradition when they addressed
          this problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is the Land
          Problem.</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
          Land Problem takes two primary forms: land price escalation and
          concentrated land ownership.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As our system of economic
          development proceeds, land values rise faster than wages increase,
          until inevitably the price paid for access to land consumes increasing
          amounts of a worker's wages. In classical economics, this dilemma is
          called the "law of rent" and has been mostly ignored by mainstream
          economists. The predictability of the "law of rent" - that land values
          will continually rise - fuels frenzies of land speculation and the
          inevitable bust that follows the boom.</span> A recent <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>cover
          story informs us that there are big gains and huge risks in housing
          speculation in about 30 predominantly coastal markets that encompass
          100 million people. Since 2000, home prices in New York, Washington,
          and Boston have surged 56% to 61%. Prices jumped 58% in Miami and Los
          Angeles and 76% in San Diego where the median home price county-wide is
          $582,000. The gap between home prices and fundamentals like job growth
          and incomes is greater than ever.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></small></small></li>
            <li><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The
          second form of the Land Problem is the fact that in most countries,
          including the United States, a small minority of people own and control
          a disproportionately large amount of land and natural resources.</span></small>
          Data suggests that about 3% of the population owns 95% of the privately
          held land in the US. Less than 600 companies control 22% of our private
          land, a land mass the size of Spain. Those same companies land
          interests worldwide comprise a total area larger than that of Europe -
          almost 2 billion acres.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[8]</span>    </small> </small></li>
        </ul>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In order to show that there was
          NO NEED for land reform in Central
          America because our land in the US is even more concentrated in
          ownership than Central America, Senator Jesse Helms read these facts
          into the Congressional Record in 1981: </small></div>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>In Florida, 1% owns 77% of the land. 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>Other states where the top 1% own over two-thirds of the
          land are Maine, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon.</small></li>
        </ul>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A United Nations study of 83
          countries showed that less than 5% of
          rural landowners control three-quarters of the land. Other studies on
          land ownership report these facts: </small></div>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brazil</span>, 2% of
          landowners hold 60% of the arable land while close to 70% of rural
          households have little or none. Just 342 farm properties in Brazil
          cover 183,397 square miles - an area larger than California. 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Venezuela</span>, 77%
          of the farmland is owned by 3% of the people. In Spain, 70 per cent of
          the land is owned by 0.2 per cent of the people. 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Britain</span>, 69
          per cent
          of the land is owned by 0.6 per cent of the population. Just 158,000
          families own 41 million acres of land while 24 million families live on
          four million acres.<small></small></small></li>
        </ul>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The basic human need for food
          and shelter requires access of labor to
          land. With access to land people can produce the basic requirements of
          life. Access to land provides an enabling environment for life itself
          and thus meets the minimum requirement of love, meaning fairness in
          human relations based on the fundamental equal right to exist. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
          Land Problem in its two forms - the inequitable ownership and control
          of land and natural resources and the treatment of land as a market
          commodity - is the root cause of the great amount of human deprivation
          and suffering from lack of the basic necessities of life.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">And
          yet the human right to the earth is missing from the Bill of Rights,
          the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Covenant on
          Economic, Social and Cultural Human Rights.</span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Democratic governance has not yet concerned itself with a "first
          principle" question. This question concerns property rights in land -
          property rights in the earth itself. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
          question is, "Who Should Own the Earth?"</span>
          The question of "Who Should Own the Earth?" is a fundamental question.
          In venues when this question is asked, the answer is always the same.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The answer is, "everyone should own the
          earth and on an equal basis as a birthright."</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          <small>The right to the earth has yet to be pronounced in human rights
          covenants. Democracy is unclear, ethically weak, and on shaky ground
          when it comes to the question of the right to the land and resources of
          the earth. Democracy as presently constituted lacks this most
          fundamental and basic human right - the equal right to earth. The right
          to the earth is the great undiscovered revolution in both American and
          global politics. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Throughout
          history - and even today - wealth and privilege has
          been based upon ownership of land and monopoly.</span> Economics,
          unchecked
          and in ignorance of the land and rent question, remains "the
          caveman's law, the law of the sharpest tooth, the angriest brow and
          the greediest maw." (so said Al Smith, Governor of New York and
          presidential candidate during the 1920s)</small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But we know there is a better
          way. The recognition that
"territoriality" may be necessary as the law of survival for lower
          species is not borne out for mankind; for humanity there is a higher
          order. The human condition, the dignity of man and the aspiring
          benevolence that are made material by way of man's free association
          and the free exchange of labor and its handmaiden - capital.&nbsp; </small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land rent is socially
          created, it is the fruit of the loins of
          unfettered labor and capital.</span> Monopoly and privilege are the
          highwaymen who rob us of the means to end poverty, slums and
          depression. This is the promise of LVT. This is the big idea. The
          hope. Something to believe in - its time surely has come. <a

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Another attractive feature
                of land taxation is its interesting positive effect on the economic
                base of a city. It strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee
                owners harder than resident owners.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The
                land fraction in real estate is generally highest in the CBD of any
                city, so that is a favorite place for absentees to buy and hold.
                They like the steady income, and the "trophy" quality. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
                surplus in real estate is what attracts outside buyers, and land
                is what yields the surplus.</span></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>About 2/3 of downtown Los Angeles is owned
                by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more workaday city, Milwaukee,
                the absentee owners consist of former residents, or their heirs,
            who grew too rich to abide the harsh winters.</b></small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your
              balance of payments. When you get more tax money from absentees, money
              that used to flow to Tehran, Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows into your
              local treasury to pay your local teachers and city workers, and relieve
              your builders and building managers. In this way taxing land actually
            acts to undergird the value of its own base.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><br>
</b><b>Summary</b>
<br>
Dismal trade-offs, deadlocks, and standoffs are just mental blocks
and smokescreens. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George began
with a quest for justice in
sharing the rent surplus. He found that justice and efficiency are
not at odds, we can have both.</span> This trade-off that many
economists
expound is a stall, a put-off to enervate and unman us so we won't do
anything. It may ease the conscience to think justice must be
sacrificed for efficiency, and schools starved and libraries closed
to free up incentives, so nothing, really, can ever be done. We all
feel compassion by nature but, to survive and stay whole in this
world of beggars and bandits, learn to harden our hearts and cork it
in. We learn to screen out evidence of suffering and injustice, and
rationalize what we cannot deny. This mindset, while understandable,
is unaffordable in a period of dangerous national decline, and
growing division between haves and have-nots. </small>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>What we have shown here is not
just that
we can have both justice
and efficiency, but more, we cannot have either one without the
other. If we don't share rents efficiently, in the Georgist manner,
social and political pressures will continue to cause inefficient
sharing and eventual dissipation.</small></p>
<p><small>Economic discourse is afflicted with pessimists who firmly
cling
to mutually inconsistent positions at the same time, each posing an
insoluble problem. Some, for example, believe the world is racing to
starvation, and favor limiting demand through birth control, while in
another context they deplore "overproduction," or "underconsumption,"
and favor choking off farm production to keep farmers from losing
money. George, of course, would see demand as the answer to supply,
and land as the field on which the twain may meet and satisfy each
other, leveling them upwards.</small></p>
<p><small>Again, some favor cheap power and good roads for rural areas,
regardless of cost, and then favor low-density zoning to keep people
out. George, of course, would favor infilling to make full use of
short interior lines at high capacity, and lower cost per
customer.</small></p>
<small><b>Epilogue: how the
public demonstrates its preference for resolutions over dismal
choices</b> </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">A land tax abates concentration of
wealth and power without
limiting ambition or enterprise. It taxes wealth while sparing both
capital and income. It puts no cap on ambition and enterprise,
except to redirect those useful traits into creation, production,
hiring, and capital formation, and away from the zero-sum game of
land-grabbing.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It requires no incentive-warping
progressive rate: all land is
taxed at the same rate, in proportion to value. The tax achieves
progressivity by using the observed reality that wealth rises with
income, faster than income; and landholdings rise with wealth, faster
than wealth. Otherwise put, the land tax offsets concentration
because ownership of wealth is more concentrated than income; and
ownership of land is more concentrated than other forms of wealth. As
George said, "The great cause of the concentration of wealth is
concentration of the ownership of land."<span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the state or local level,
George's program is the answer to
California Governor Pete Wilson' dilemma, and every governor's
dilemma: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>it untaxes and attracts capital, and encourages capital
formation, without giving away the store, or untaxing the rich, or
starving the schools and police. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>It raises state revenues from the
richest people while attracting business and wealth with the very
same stroke.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
unique, remarkable quality of a property tax based
on land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land, however high the tax rate. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Not one square foot will walk out
of town. The only bad thing to say
about this tax's incentive effects is that it stimulates
revitalization, and makes jobs.</span> If some people think that is
bad,
maybe they are the problem.</span></small><small>&nbsp; So George's
simple
program not only reconciles efficiency and
equity, it squares taxes and incentives.&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Credit follows collateral. In
periods of high and rising land
prices, borrowers get used to pledging land to secure loans, and

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the good side, this lack of
land collateral would stop lenders'
discriminating in favor of landowners, as they do now. <span

remove a major cause of the concentration of economic power and
control, that is the clustering of credit around original nuclei of
large, superior landholdings. The credit is often used to buy still
more land, to reserve for possible future use and at the same time to
withhold from competitors.</span> Such concentration and market control

the ugly side of extant Western "capitalism," when enterprise
degenerates into greed and acquisitions supplant innovations.... <a

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PTiaPT.html">The Property Tax
is a Progressive Tax</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Property
Ownership Is More Concentrated Than Income</b></small> </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To begin, a large share of the
adult population -- half, as a rough
measure -- are renters and own no meaningful value of taxable property
at all. Most of these essentially propertyless adults do earn
taxable wage income. (We consider later whether property taxes are
shifted onto them.)</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Savings rise with income, faster
than income. With savings one
acquires property, and we would naturally expect therefore higher
income groups to own property in proportion to their greater saving,
which is a disproportionately high share of their high incomes. And
we would also expect a high share of high incomes to come from
property.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Musgrave <i>et al.</i> support
this. They rank 1948 U.S.
"Spending Units" by income and group them, using Treasury sources of
data. The highest class got 23% of the income, but 78% of dividend
income and 45% of rental income, and only 12% of the wage and salary
income.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(14)</i></b></small></font> Other
sources might
be cited, too.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Musgrave <i>et al.</i> omitted
capital gains. These are probably
the most concentrated source of income, and of course
property-derived. Realized gains swell from virtually nothing at the
$10,000 income level to about half of income at the million dollar
level.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(15)</i></b></small></font>
Unrealized accrued
gains, which we should include in a proper Haig-Simons income
concept, are probably larger yet, and more concentrated. There are
no easy data on this, but several a priori and indirect reasons to
think them concentrated. The rich have a comparative advantage in
waiting for deferred cash. They are known to favor growth stocks,
undistributed profits, speculative landholdings and unripe minerals,
major sources of unrealized accruals.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Among those who do own material
amounts of property, concentration
is high relative to that of income. The top 10% of income receivers,
as income is usually defined and reported, get about 30% of all
income. Every study of property owners shows figures in another
ballpark altogether. Table I summarizes what several such studies
show about the top group. Note that most of these figures show only
concentration among those who own enough property to be counted, thus
understating concentration among the whole population.&nbsp;<strong> ...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Corporate shares are not taxable
property, but of course corporate
income is mostly derived from taxable
property.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(18)</i></b></small></font> Some
will object
that corporations have many owners and should not be treated as
single units. That is true, but again, it smacks of regression
fallacy. Wealthy owners also have many corporations, and in general
corporate shares are the most concentrated kind of asset.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Ownership of large property gives
one control of other assets.
Property is borrowing power and credit rating: all studies show
interest rates to be very regressive with size and quality of
collateral, and terms easier. But simple borrowing is only the
beginning. With great wealth one goes into banking and exerts
multiple leverage. The story has been told many times, if not as
well, since Brandeis' <b><i>Other Peoples' Money</i></b>: collateral,
leverage, conglomerates, interlocking directorates, mergers, lender
suasion, industrial leadership, pyramiding, the Wallenberg Grip,
subcontracting market power, control of dealerships, . . . . Control
is power and status (psychic income), and control is a source of
additional income, as revealed by the premium prices of shares during
battles for control.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data
in Table I probably understate
concentration, for four
general reasons</span>: omitting the unpropertied, accepting and
reporting
regressive assessments, accepting the bias in partial inventories,
and accepting and reporting straw owners as separate owners.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>1. Omitting the unpropertied.
... </b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>2. Accepting
regressive assessments as fact.&nbsp; ...</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>3. The bias in
partial inventories ... </b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">housing</span>, it is the
rich who have second homes, hobby farms,
summer resorts, tax shelters, ski houses, Caribbean hideaways, lake
frontage, and advance sites for future building. Yet studies of
income and housing, from which some would damn the property tax,
compare a full statement of income (at least wage income) with
housing narrowly defined. Walter Morton (p. 143) goes so far as to
judge the entire property tax on the basis of housing alone. He not
only omitted second homes, but other property comprising half the
total: commerce, industry, rental, vacant, farm, forest, mineral,
water, and miscellaneous. Again, ownership of these is concentrated
among those ranking high in the housing scale.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>4. Accepting
straw owners as separate owners ...
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is
an outline rationale for the property tax.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.
"Ability-to-pay" derives from wealth as well as current income. </span>James
Tobin, Arnold Zellner, Taylor and Houthakker, Harold Somers,
and others have stressed this lately. The old cliche that "taxes are
paid out of income" is as empty as the one that we consume "out of
income." We spend money, and it is not labelled.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.
The property tax asserts a public equity in land which was won
and is defended by joint efforts, and whose value derives from public
works and spillovers, not from the owners' efforts.</span> It exempts
human
effort, thus rewarding service to the community and denying the state
any equity in the bodies of its citizens whose freedom and dignity is
thus enhanced in their capacity as human beings, as distinct from
owners of wealth.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.
Property taxes reduce the differential effect of inherited
wealth on the current generation.</span> They strike directly at
concentration of economic and other power based on wealth, promoting
competition and equal opportunity. Property as collateral is a
source of invisible income (credit rating). Taxing property reduces
the differential advantage of the rich in credit rationing.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.
Property income of a given dollar value places the receiver on
a higher welfare plane than labor income, because he needn't work for
it.</span> $10,000 a year received by dint of working long hours in a
coal
mine with black lung disease is not the same as $10,000 plus a life
of ease.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.
The property tax is needed to plug loopholes in the income tax,
which is inexorably devolving into a payroll tax. </span></small><font

inside information, good contacts, corrupt aides, etc.&nbsp; The
history
of disposal of US public domain leaves no doubt about this -- and it is
still going on with air rights, water, spectrum, landing rights,
fishing
licenses, etc.&nbsp; Choices being made currently are just as tainted
as
those of 19th century history (with never a peep from Chicago, but
heavy applause).</small><br>
<br>
<small style="text-decoration: underline;">Selling land in large blocks
under frontier conditions is to
sell at a
time before it begins yielding much if any rent.&nbsp; It is bid on by
those
few who have<span style="font-weight: bold;"> large discretionary funds
of patient money</span>.&nbsp;
Politicians, meantime, treat the proceeds as current revenues used to
hold down other taxes today, leaving the nation with inadequate
revenues
in the future.</small><br>
<br>
<small>iii)<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>The ability to bid
high does
not necessarily come from legitimate saving.&nbsp; The early wealth of
Liverpool came from the slave trade.&nbsp; High bidders for many
properties today are middle eastern potentates who neither produced nor
saved the wealth they control.&nbsp; Other high bidders are criminals,
who find the "sanctity of property" a splendid route for
laundering their gains, and a permanent shelter against further
prosecution. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Ownership and tenure rights derive only from appropriation, not
saving,
investment or production.&nbsp; Capital, by contrast, is owned by those
who formed it. Only after that does capital bear much resemblance to
land in that they coexist.&nbsp; Standard micro&#8209;economics obscures the
differences because it deals mainly with relations of coexistence,
ignoring the continual formation and destruction of capital, ignoring
time and relations of sequence.&nbsp; Thus it excludes from its purview
the differences between land and capital.&nbsp; Micro deals mainly with
how existing resources are allocated at a moment in time, not how they
originate, grow, flourish, reproduce, age, senesce and die.</small><br>
<br>
<small>b.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Inertia
takes over
after the original distribution, perpetuating and aggravating it.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Inertia, both financial and political, transmitted through
generations
by
inheritance, is a major control over the distribution of wealth and
income.&nbsp; How else can one explain their exceedingly distorted
distributions, in contrast with the normal distribution of most human
abilities?&nbsp; Inertia extends the original pattern for
generations.&nbsp; More, the advantages given by controlling
discretionary funds (those not needed for subsistence) magnify the
original political result. <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The corollary of high land price is
high carrying cost relative to cash flow.</span><br>
Carrying cost is interest on the price of land.&nbsp; It varies with
one's internal interest rate (IIR).&nbsp; For those with high IIRs, the
carrying cost of land normally exceeds cash flow.&nbsp; Otherwise put,
cash flow from land seldom covers carrying cost, while cash flow from
depreciable capital covers more than its carrying cost because it
normally has to be priced low enough for cash flow to cover both
interest and depreciation.&nbsp; As to inventories of rising assets
like steers or timber, they are like zero-coupon bonds: there is no
cash flow before sale, but the famine leads to a feast of total
recovery.<br>
<br>
Since land lasts forever while demands for land grow, the normal
expectation over long periods is that ground rents will rise.&nbsp;
Present land value includes the discounted values of expected higher
future rents.&nbsp; This makes current land values very high relative
to current cash flows, which are less than expected future flows.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; In stock market terms, the
Price/Earnings ratio of land is high, like that of a growth
stock.&nbsp; This is more than an analogy, since a large share of the
assets of corporations consist of land.&nbsp; In the USA, corporations
are the major landholders. ...<br>
<br>
</span>Few people can invest heavily in an asset of high price and
deferred yields.&nbsp; Those who can do so have a field with fewer
competitors than most, and tend to expand widely.&nbsp; As Loyd Fisher,
a rustic Nebraska land economist twanged to me and others 30 years ago,
"When a rancher buys these days it ain't the quarters roundin' out,
it's the sections gobblin' the quarters."<br>
<br>
Those with existing cores of rent-yielding land -- &#8220;existing nuclei&#8221; --
enjoy a continual flow of discretionary funds they can use to buy more
land.&nbsp; The advantage of a head start snowballs over time.<br>
<br>
Buying with equity funds is only the beginning.&nbsp; Land is the basis
for extending credit.&nbsp; The "sections" go to the banks for
accommodation to buy the "quarters."&nbsp; As Rainer Schikele wrote,
"The basis of credit is not marginal productivity, but collateral
security." A major factor giving one a good credit rating is the prior
ownership of land. <br>
<br>
Thus, owning land is not just dominated by, but also dominates access
to long-term credit.&nbsp; Here is a positive feedback loop: it takes
good credit to buy land, and prior ownership of land gives one good
credit. Those already owning land have access to more land at a lower
carrying cost than those trying to enter the market from poverty.&nbsp;
The result is a tendency for land to agglomerate in the hands of the
financially strong (cf.&nbsp; B-8).&nbsp;<strong> ...<br>
</strong><br>
</small><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It follows
that
landownership
is highly concentrated.</span> <br>
Land is a major basis, probably the
major
basis of the concentration
of wealth.&nbsp; Political distribution, if egalitarian, may stave this
off for a considerable time.&nbsp; There is also evidence that heavy
land
taxation, where that is applied, motivates subdivision.&nbsp; However,
experience is that, in the absence of heavy taxation, the surplus of
rent
attracts absentee investors, and large concentrations reconstitute
themselves inexorably.&nbsp; The writer and others have documented such
concentration elsewhere.<small></small></small>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>What concentration means for bargaining power has been
foreshadowed in
B-3.&nbsp; What
it means
for market power is treated in B-11.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Amassing land is always done, can only be
done, by shrinking the
holdings of others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt.&nbsp; If A is to
have
more then B, C, D <i>et al. </i>must have less, there is no other
way.&nbsp; A can amass more capital by saving, creating new capital,
leaving B, C, D <i>et al. </i>with as much as before.&nbsp; A can
increase his labor income by working longer, or harder, or smarter,
producing more, leaving others with as much as before.&nbsp; He and she
together can also spawn more children: labor, like capital, is
reproducible, and indefinitely augmentable.&nbsp; Possessing land,
however, means just one thing: bumping others.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the region of the mind, the thing possessed may be shared by
all
with
no diminution to anyone.&nbsp; No one's pleasure In Shakespeare, or
Beethoven, or understanding physics is any less because at the same
time
millions of others have the same pleasure.&nbsp; Art, letters and
science
are the common property of mankind, open to all who care to acquire
them.&nbsp; The
creative producer's pleasure is in proportion to the number with whom
he
shares.&nbsp; The gratification is from sharing, not excluding.&nbsp;
The
contrast with landholding is nearly total.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small>Amassing claims on wealth by creating and producing is not,
therefore,
a
threat to others.&nbsp; Amassing capital through saving does not weaken
or impoverish others.&nbsp; Producing goods does not interfere with
others' doing the same.&nbsp; One producer may drive another from a
particular limited market, but glutting one market increases real
demand
for the products of other markets, and raises the real value of others'
incomes by lowering prices.&nbsp; Amassing land, however, has to
deprive
others, both relatively and absolutely.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Concentrated holding and
control of land, therefore, have always been threats to the well-being
of
those left out.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Conversely, the only way the landless, e.g. in South Africa, can
get
land
is from those who now have it.&nbsp; "Growth" is often advanced
as the solution to maldistribution, injustice and poverty, but that is
mere temporizing because land does not grow.&nbsp; When production and
demand grow, land rents rise.&nbsp; Of land it is starkly true, "the
problem is not production, but distribution".&nbsp; There is no
production; only distribution.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Massed control of land is the most
natural base for monopolizing
markets because land is limited.&nbsp; Buying land always does double
duty: when A expands he <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span>
preempts opportunities from B. For
example, a chain of service stations with most of the best comers in a
town has market power, the more so if it also holds a large share of
oil
sources, of refinery sites, of "offset rights" to pollute air,
transmission rights of way, harbor sites, and other such limited
lands.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Preemption is not always just a by-product of expansion; it may
be the
main point.&nbsp; For example, in 1993 Builders'
Emporium, a large chain of California hardware stores with large
parking
lots in good locations, closed down and sold out.&nbsp; The sites were
bought up by the largest grocery chain in southern California, Vons
Company.&nbsp; According to news reports, this is "a shut-out strategy
against competitors."&nbsp; Vons will convert 6-8 Emporium stores to
Vons' markets, and "hold onto the others until commercial rents rebound
-- then market them to non-rivals."</small><br>
<br>
<small>Salomon Bros. analyst Jonathan Ziegler, far from being shocked,
praises
this as "ingenious."&nbsp; "You're controlling who's in your market
area."&nbsp; Ralphs, another grocery chain, had been looking for sites
and is now shut out.&nbsp; The stores
remain empty today; the land idle.&nbsp; <a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who
buys to hold these vast reserves for distant future use? They
are of investment grade only for those with waiting power.</span>
Unripe
lands and resources are probably the most closely held assets there
are. Poor people and small businessmen need busy capital right now.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Only a few of the wealthiest people
have the deep pockets and slack
money to buy far ahead, to maintain high reserve/output ratios. These
markets in far future values are their special preserve.</span> </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is being bought? Are these
not "leases," contracts to pay
rent? No, these leases are not that. Here is the heart of
Pseudo-Socialism. The U.S. Government leases mineral-prone lands
under the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Bid System</span>,"
whereby most of the payment is required
up front in spot cash. This makes a "lease" more like a sale, a sale
in which buyers are screened by their banking connections rather than
by their ability to find and produce hydrocarbons. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
bonus system originated on private uplands. It was a way for
big oil firms to dazzle various rustics, pressed for cash, by
tempting them with front money for their mineral rights.</span> The
companies had the cash, the connections, and intimidating expertise;
they wrote the rules their way. The rules included a cap of 12.5% on
the long-term "royalty," the only means by which lessors participated
over the long pull, and retained a share in gushers and bonanzas that
proved in excess of original estimates - estimates much better known
to the bidders than the lessors. When the companies moved onto public
lands they brought the same system with them. It was by then an
industry standard. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
only "bid variable" in this system is the bonus.</span> With the
royalty capped, there are large potential surpluses to attract bonus
bids. The Physiocratic rule of compensation applies: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a low royalty
translates into a high leasehold value</span>. The advantage of this to
"the
industry" - meaning the largest firms that are its most visible
spokesmen and exemplars - is that it screens out many bidders, those
pressed for front money. It reserves the field for a much smaller
number of players, increasing their bargaining power. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small style="font-weight: bold;">All
that may sound familiar to students of 19th Century American
history, and the privatization of the vast Federal domain. It is a
long story of conflict between cash sales and more democratic means
of placing lands. Those with cash and bank connections naturally
favored cash sales. President Jefferson saw the merit in credit
sales, so from 1801-20, sales were on credit. The system was badly
administered, but so were all other systems of land disposal tried in
that era. Collections became a problem, yet landownership was
democratized. It enabled Andrew Jackson to proclaim on Thanksgiving
Day, 1835, "We thank Thee for the absence of unemployment which in
the King-ridden countries of the world is causing widespread
suffering among the toiling masses and has led to riots ... (and
that) there will be none to freeze, starve, or be beset by the fear
of want this winter or the winters yet to come." <font><small><small><font><small><a

CONCLUSION
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is a common belief that
property tax relief is "good for
farmers." It certainly raises the private share of economic rent.
That in turn raises the investment grade of farmland and encourages
its purchase as a store of value, a place to park slack money. This
may be at odds, however, with using it as a vehicle for enterprise
and an outlet for workmanship. Lower farm property taxes are
associated with lower ratios of capital to land, and labor to land,
both over time and among states. They are also associated with bigger
mean farm size and less equal distribution of farm sizes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the sections that follow, I
first document the rise of
inequality in the distribution of farmland that followed a sharp drop
in farm property tax rates after 1930. Then I show, by
cross-sectional analysis, a positive relationship between higher
property tax rates and more intensive use of farmland, which in turn
is associated with more equal distribution of farmland. Conversely, I
find property tax relief associated with underuse and
underimprovement of land.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>A priori</i>, a tax on
buildings works to suppress building and
to penalize smaller farmers, whose building to land ratio is higher
than that of bigger farmers. The findings seem to show, therefore, a
stronger countereffect, proincentive and pro-subdivision, of the
other part of the property tax, the part based on land value.<br>
... <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, however, 34 percent
of all irrigated land is in the top bracket, farms of 2,000 acres and
over. </span><font size="-1"><small><b><i>(10) </i></b></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Control of irrigated
land means control over water. Control of water gives control over
arid lands roundabout. Ownership and control based on water have
become highly concentrated. For farms with irrigated land, GR = .82,
</span><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1"><small><i>(11)</i></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> substantially higher than
the GR of .76 for all farms. ...</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>To sum up,
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>rising acreages mean there are fewer farms overall.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising labor prices per farm mean aspiring farmers who
lack prior wealth can no longer buy in.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gini Ratios mean acreage is less equally shared
among a given number of farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gamma factors mean the higher quality land is
moving into bigger farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>The Gamma data are confirmed by rising shares of cropland
and irrigated land in vast farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising P/C ratios reflect a higher LSREV, and they mean it
is harder for a newcomer to acquire any farm acres.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The combination means the
agricultural ladder has been pulled up.
Entry is nearly impossible for farmers lacking outside finance; exit
and latifundiazation proceed apace. These changes accompanied and
followed a 40 percent drop in farm property tax rates.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE LESSER
IMPROVEMENT OF BIGGER FARMS</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A result of rising concentration
is the separation of land from
capital. With some exaggeration, American latifundia are now lands
without buildings, but buildings cluster on smaller farms, many
without enough land. This implies at least three points.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, building wealth is more equally distributed than
land wealth.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, the property tax would be more progressive if
changed to a pure land tax, exempting buildings.</small></li>
  <li><small>Third, many latifundia are not being used to their
potential, while capital on some small farms is undercomplemented with
land. I support the case first using national data, and then by
comparing states.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is awkward that the 1987
Census of Agriculture defines "farm
size," and ranks farms, only by acres rather than value.&nbsp; ...<br>
<br>
<b>Concentration of
irrigated land</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The yield per acre of most crops
stays level or rises with
harvested acres per farm. At the same time, sales per dollar of real
estate fall somewhat. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(21)</i></b></small></font>
The
most likely reason is that the quality of harvested land rises with
quantity. There is, to be sure, a trade-off between quality and
quantity, but there is also a bond. Whoever can afford more can
afford better. Which effect is stronger? The question must be
resolved by data.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>Comparing different crops,
high values of GR go with crops

1.0 percent of the farms, 11.3 percent of the harvested acres, and 26
percent of the irrigated acres in silage corn. ...</font><br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The 1940 Census of Agriculture was
the last to separate $L from
$B, overall. In 1940 the <b>building share of real estate value
($B/[$L+B], or BSREV)</b> was .69 in the
lowest acreage bracket, .31 for all farms, and .12 for farms of 1,000

<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>AELOS (1988) gives no comparable
comprehensive data, but it does
give two series that test the point and have the advantage of
disaggregation. One is for "owner-operators" and one for "landlords

was .63 for farms under 10 acres; .29 for all farms; and .12 for
farms of 2,000 acres and over. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(37)

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>CONCLUSION</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One may at least firmly conclude
that large farm units are less
improved and less peopled than small and medium-sized farms. There
are two possible interpretations. One is that big farms are more
efficient, getting more from less, but that is refuted by their
getting less output per $L. The other is that Veblen was right, many
of them are oversized stores of value, held first to park slack money
and only secondly to produce food and fiber, and complement the
owner's workmanship.&nbsp;The
Florida 9 [the high LSREV states] may represent a home grown rural
"third world" of large,
underutilized landholdings that preempt the best land and force
median farmers onto small farms on low-grade land.</small><font
 size="-2"></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The issue cannot be settled in a
few words, but the implications
for tax policy are the same either way. If large units are more
efficient, they can bear heavier taxes. If they are less efficient,
heavier PTRs will induce them to release surplus land for others,
which will tend at the margins to equalize factor proportions, moving
more states from the Florida toward the Wisconsin model. </small><small><a

<p>Walt Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html">Have We
Forgotten The Foundation?</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The land ethic and land practices,
which served our economy and cities
so well, sadly fell into disrepair. Here are five of the more important
reasons:
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One: By 1900 the frontier
was gone.</span>
The country was virtually all fenced in. Historian Frederick Jackson
Turner in the 1890s underscored the frontier's importance. Its free or
cheap land had been a safety valve for labor. Workers who felt
exploited could go West--strike out on their own.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Two: Prodigious
concentrations of wealth materially altered the economic landscape. </span>Some
of these were based on railway land giveaways. Most were tied to
natural resource monopolies -- of coal, timber, oil, cattle lands and
so
forth -- whose owners found ways to fend off land taxes.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Three: A shift from local
to federal power occurred in the political arena. </span>The
national government had to grow to save the Union and execute the Civil
War. It also expanded to combat abuses of giant combines and trusts. To
underwrite this growth, Congress turned primarily to tax-ing production
and incomes.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Four: At the urging of
land
monopolists who practically owned many state legislatures in the late
1800s, state governments discarded property taxes, replacing them with
income and sales taxes.</span> Local governments also gradually began
to decrease their reliance on property taxes.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Five: The property tax
itself
was transformed. It became less a tax on land values, increasingly a
tax on improvements--that is, on houses, stores, offices and other
edifices on the land.</span> These factors gave rise to slums, to
panics (as depressions were then called), and a widening gap between
the haves and have-nots. As a corrective, Henry George in his 1879
masterwork, <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>,
urged Americans to address the land problem. He inspired a large
popular following, but many academics, politicians, economists and
captains of industry asked scornfully, "What land problem?"</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It calls to mind the routine
where Jimmy Durante got caught steeling an
elephant from a circus. A cop says, "Hey, where 'ya going with that
elephant?" And Durante replies, "What elephant?" A century later, few
question that we have an elephantine land problem. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Ecologists know it. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Sprawl and crawl people know it. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Many elected officials, homebuyers, and people trying to
start a farm or a business know it. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, too few have a clue
about how to deal with land issues, or any
notion that archeological digs into our history might provide useful
answers. Instead, consider what's happening:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Habitat volunteers build
houses for the poor, making recipients
and its volunteers feel real good.</span> This is a fine example of
charity
combined with self-help, and it spreads awareness of a great social
ill. But more housing is being abandoned and demolished than Habitat is
able to build.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This same treadmill
effect undermines federal efforts. </span>HUD has
spent billions on public housing, urban renewal and enterprise zones.
Some of these programs have retarded urban decline but their strongest
advocates would not claim they have come close to stopping or reversing
it.</small></li>

Yet they often invade wheat fields and wood lots far from the job

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is not just average
incomes
per capita that define the economic
position of most people in a state or city.&nbsp; The distribution of
income and wealth makes a lot of difference.&nbsp; But wait again: IRS
data, and other data derived from IRS sources, vastly misstate the
concentration of real income because they omit the imputed income of
owner-occupied housing.&nbsp; Thus, a salary-earner paying high rent in
the Gold Coast of Chicago has the same reported income as one on the
same salary on the same Gold Coast who owns his own million dollar
house or coop or condo, and pays no rent. More: the renter&#8217;s income is
actually reported as higher, because the owner gets to deduct the costs
of ownership, interest and property taxes.&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> It&#8217;s the renters who
turn Chicago blue - along with most big cities. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small>The
difference between tenants and owners is stark and obvious.&nbsp;
There are also differences among owners.&nbsp; In poorer cities, the
&#8220;skew&#8221; of home values is much less than in richer cities.&nbsp; &#8220;Skew&#8221;
means inequality, and is measured in many ways.&nbsp; An easy way is
the ratio of the mean home value to the median value: the higher the
ratio, the greater the skew.&nbsp; In southern California, as we move
from the red interior to the blue coast, the skew rises a lot, meaning
the top values rise faster than the other values.&nbsp; Thus, in the
blue counties the homeowners are less equal to each other. Here, too,
there is a greater gap between tenants and homeowners; and there are
more tenants.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The blue counties report higher incomes per person than the red
inland
counties.&nbsp; You might think this would compensate for their higher
home values, but you&#8217;d be wrong.&nbsp; Moving from red to blue, home
values rise faster than incomes.&nbsp; The National Association of
Realtors (NAR) and its state affiliates report &#8220;Affordability Indexes&#8221;
for different cities.&nbsp; These indexes show what fraction of the
residents can afford to buy the median-priced home.&nbsp; The higher
the median income, the lower the Affordability Index.
Counter-intuitive?&nbsp; Again, that is because home values rise faster
than incomes.&nbsp; The blue counties are those with lower
affordability indexes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The same pattern prevails nationwide. Median income ranges from
a low
of $36.3K in El Paso to a high of $91.5K in Washington, D.C., a ratio
of 2.5/1.&nbsp; Median home values range from a low of $87K in
Buffalo/Niagara Falls to a high of $531K in the San Francisco Bay area,
a ratio of 6.1/1.&nbsp; This is a general pattern: incomes vary a
little among places; home prices vary a lot.&nbsp; Blue states and blue
counties are generally those where land is out of reach of a high
fraction of the people.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What that means for social psychology and voting patterns I
leave to
you. One thing is clear: &#8220;income&#8221; is a catchword that has obscured
analysis for Willkie&#8217;s fifty years, and more.&nbsp; To solve the
red-blue voting puzzle, we must study land values. <a

Owns Southern California?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These notes on concentration of
landholdings were originally
compiled in 1988 and have been updated from time to time since then.
The most recent revisions were made in 1997.</small><small></small><br>

4. INSTITUTIONS
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Several million persons, perhaps half the resident adult
population,
hold titles to land in southern California. With so many holders, the
median holding is perforce small, although well above the national
median. But the mean holding is well above the median, indicating a
skewed distribution.</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>All wealth distributions are skewed; so, to a lesser degree, are
income
distributions. Landholding, however, is more skewed than other
distributions.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> In 1985 the Internal
Revenue Service released a Report based on a study of 1983 estate tax
returns. According to the Report, "More than one half of his (the mean
top wealth-holder's) wealth was held as real estate and corporate
stock, with real estate surpassing corporate stock as the most
prominent asset in the top wealth-holder's portfolio."</span> (AP
dispatch by Jim Luther, Riverside Press Enterprise, 8 March 1985, p.
A3.) This Report warrants careful study. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. HOLDINGS BY ALIENS&nbsp; ...
Non-resident aliens own about
75% of the "major" buildings in the L.A.
CBD west of Broadway ...</small><br>
<small>2. AMERICANS FROM OTHER STATES ... </small><small>
A second kind of holder is the out-of-state American, individual or
corporate.</small><br>
<small>3. CALIFORNIANS Many of our largest landholders also live in
California. This is partly
because the lands are here, but moreso because certain places in
California are good places to live. One of the advantages of receiving
property as opposed to labor income is it lets one choose his
residence. California ranks after New York in the number of rich
Americans (using Forbes' list) who reside here.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Also included here are California-based corporations. A
corporation's
"base" refers simply to the site of its headquarters: its shareholders
are scattered around the world, and the major shareholders, who
exercise control, are effectively screened behind layers of trusts and
financial institutions, so they are impossible to identify with
certainty.</small><br>
<small>4. INSTITUTIONS</small><br>
<small>Institutions acquire land for their operations and then it tends
to
stick to them for various reasons. It is tax free, for one, so long as
they retain it (and do not use it commercially). They are not subject
to corporate raids. Thus there is no mechanism whereby the current
opportunity cost of land is felt by management. It never appears in
their budgets; they never need compete for or justify it. College
Boards are not accountable to any public body, a precedent set by
Marshall's U.S. Supreme Court in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819.</small><br>
</div>
Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Eventho' almost everyone would worry about paying
more tax, the PTS is
inherently progressive. Studies of the towns in Pennsylvania that have
shifted some tax from buildings to land show that about 75% come out
ahead (nearly the entire bottom four quintiles of income earners), 20%
break even and 5% pay more (together a bit larger than the top quintile
of income recipients), who are usually absentee owners.<b><br>
</b></small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>Without coercion or remote planning, the PTS
improves our settlement
patterns. Regulations and zoning, some assume, might be vitiated or
obviated, become obsolete. Instead, the PTS makes it easier for
regulations and zoning to do their job. Since the land tax lowers land
price, buying land for parks and reserves is more easily afforded. The
loss in revenue from removing the newly public lands from the tax rolls
would be offset somewhat by the corresponding rise in value of sites
near the protected open space. Creating green spaces raises the density
of already developed land, and thus its value. Furthermore, land dues
reduce the profit from land development, making it a less attractive
investment, and land use decisions of less economic consequence.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> After
a while, people with deep pockets would turn to investments that,
post-shift, would be untaxed. </span>Reserving land for recreational
or
natural uses becomes less contentious; people could more easily
determine an optimum proportion of green space to developed space.</small></font>
...<br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Might the PTS fall heavily on low-income land
holders and elderly homeowners? The land-rich, money-poor old widow
could suffer if society were to levy sites. Eventho' the vast majority
of poor people would come out ahead, there probably will be the rare
exception. To deal with "the widow on a valuable lot", the new policy
could include deferments<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Just as some poor could pay more, some
rich could pay less, such as the
owners of a skyscraper that'd be the highest (literally) and best use
of a site. While a PTS could be a tax break for a few, the intent of
the shift is not so much to whittle away fortunes as it is to promote
prosperity, equity, and sustainability.</span> Were society to attain
such
goals, letting some fortunes escape unscathed is a small price to pay.
Also, putting a site to best use, while profitable, also benefits the
community by providing convenient employment, bringing money into the
local economy, and by precluding less efficient development, such as
sprawl. </small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Since the shift is progressive, then the rich are
footing the bill for
everyone else. To answer this charge that one group will pay more
(those who can afford it), proponents could note that the amount one
pays is scaled according to the value of what one takes -- a parcel of
nature. The payment is for exclusive use to our common heritage. Those
who exclude the rest from the best must expect to pay the most. ... <br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>In the final analysis, can those who would
redefine progress and other social reformers avoid the issue of what to
do with the immensity of Earth's worth? No. The present policy of low
land taxes and the movement to abolish all taxes on landed property
assume that Earth is ours for the exploiting. It is a mindset that must
be contradicted and laid to rest -- as was the justification for
slavery -- if environmental and planetary values are ever to ascend to
the same level as property rights. The profit from speculation or
over-extraction withers away when land dues are put in place. ... </small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Left_Must.html">What the Left Must
Do: Share the Surplus</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What would you do if you could
work two days and take five off? Write?
Play soccer? Tend to the community garden? Time off is an option made
increasingly viable by our relentlessly rising rate of productivity.
French Marxist and media critic Jean Baudrillard, while still advancing
the interests of labor, implores the Left to move on from seeing humans
as workers to seeing workers as human beings, with more needs than
merely the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling people
to live their lives more fully</span> is an issue made to order for
rescuing the Left from the doldrums that descended when &#8220;history ended&#8221;.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What would single mothers do with enough income to stay home?
What
would minorities do with the wherewithal to begin their own businesses?
What would communities do if they did not leak resources up to an upper
class and out to a distant lender or tax collector? What would the
elite do without our commonwealth? The means to these ends is an extra
income apart from labor or capital (savings), that is, a &#8220;social
salary&#8221; from society&#8217;s surplus, a &#8220;Citizens Dividend&#8221; from all the
rents, natural and governmental, that people pay for land and to the
privileged, redirected to everyone equally.&nbsp; Merely demanding a
fair sharing of the bounty from nature and modern society would raise
people&#8217;s self-esteem, a key component for political involvement.
Actually receiving an income supplement would transform our lives and
restructure society.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Unless humanity needs militarism, corporate welfare, and debt
service,
it&#8217;s fair to say most public revenue gets wasted. Demanding a dividend
&#8211; similar to Alaska paying residents a share from oil royalties &#8211;
forces a new dialog on spending priorities. Beyond arguing &#8220;bread not
bombs&#8221;, a dividend replaces expenditures by politicians (necessarily
influenced by donors) with spending by citizens, the people who
generate the
surplus in the first place. With a dividend, citizens get to see
themselves as direct beneficiaries from reigning in the wild spending
spree on imperial aggression, disloyal
multinationals, and on &#8220;borrowing&#8221; money that never existed until
&#8220;lent&#8221; by the Federal Reserve. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The Left requests and the Right promises jobs &#8211; the Left for the
income, the Right in order to keep people in their place. Workers want
to be paid for going along with the program. Bosses want to accommodate
them, albeit not fully; maintaining some unemployment spooks workers
and keeps wages down. Since jobs are the knee-jerk cure of everyone,
they can not be the signature issue of the Left. Nor can they lift our
sights. The call for jobs does not come from a place of respect but
from a willingness to accept the status quo, with prevailing hierarchy
left intact.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To deliver a bigger pie, the
Right touts efficiency and growth; to better distribute the pie, the
Left urges equity and jobs. </span>Yet
jobs are less for distributing, more for producing &#8211; if that. As
automation and globalisation expand the pie, they contract the
workforce. Even when, or especially when, people take time off to go to
war, output increases, proving we&#8217;re well over over-capacity. Juliet
Schor in her <span style="font-style: italic;">Overworked American</span>
notes this rise in productivity does not bless us with leisure but
curses us with unemployment.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demanding jobs rather than a
fair
share of society&#8217;s surplus implies that there is no commonwealth or
that expropriating it by a few is OK. Neither is true. </span>Rents
are real, and they are ours. There is a free lunch (just ask the
privileged), as those downing it do get money for nothing. And since
society, not lone owners, generates these values, that flow of funds
belongs to everyone. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">RENT &#8211; THE
STUFF
OF FORTUNES &#8211; ROCKS AND RULES</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>The
value of a parcel of land is initially based on the natural
endowments of the location (&#8220;location, location, location&#8221;), created
not by an owner but by
whatever created all of us. Next, <span style="font-weight: bold;">land
value rises with the presence of society, and grows with the population
of society. It&#8217;s highest where society is densest, in the city centers,
typically 2000 times more </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">valuable
than sites in the boondocks.</span> Land values as economic values
disappear whenever society quits respecting one&#8217;s claim, as in a war
zone; there, real estate offices nimbly shut down. And while land
titles may be the holy grail of wannabe homeowners, they&#8217;re also the
ticket to pocket unearned rent by absentee landlords, such as Donald
Trump.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Making land public does not
guarantee
that the public end up with the rent. The public&#8217;s steward, the state,
often lets public resources at &#8220;fire-sale&#8221; prices, unduly enriching
Chevron, Arco, Kerr-McGee, Weyerhauser, etc.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The state gifts enormously
valuable licenses for TV, radio, and cell phones to GE, Disney, Time
Warner, and Clear Channel. </span>The metaphor, &#8220;field of knowledge&#8221;,
lets us see patents and copyrights as flags; by excluding innovative
outsiders, they not only skew techno-progress (thus addicting
civilization to oil) but also enrich those few who can afford to corral
them: GM, DuPont, and Microsoft. Similarly, a utility franchise lets
AT&amp;T pay investors, and Enron insiders, handsomely.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Buying a land title &#8211; the granddaddy of all privileges &#8211;
typically
requires a mortgage, which disguises rent as &#8220;interest&#8221;. Pierre Joseph
Proudhon (1809-1865), French journalist/anarchist, noted: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"As long as land monopoly is maintained,
the few can take possession of what Nature free of charge has granted
to everyone, and usury will penetrate the whole society, and we will
have banks, which instead of being servants for the exchange of goods
will become powerful extorters."</span> He called this one; today&#8217;s
banks do bleed the economy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What does the central bank, the private consortium dubbed the
Federal
Reserve, lend to the US? Nothing. Given the power to create money by
Congress (which the Constitution had given to Congress), from no
savings at all but merely from legal
standing, it manufactures credit, which the US borrows, at interest.
The US exempts this interest from its income tax; people who hold US
bonds &#8211; mainly the wealthy &#8211; keep this income tax-free. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
much
and justifiably criticized corporation is in essence its corporate
charter, given value <span style="font-style: italic;">by limiting the
liability of managers, directors, and investors</span>.</span> It&#8217;s
worth at least the cost of the insurance payments not made by the
corporation, which would equal the costs imposed upon worker, customer,
and nature. As the &#8220;need&#8221; arises, legislatures extend limited liability
even further: Congress legally lowered the greater risk of nuclear
power to benefit Westinghouse, of the Valdez oil transport
spill for Exxon, and the Y2K software design bug for Microsoft. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Politicians
define legally &#8220;safe&#8221; amounts of polluted air and water for GM and
Monsanto, keeping safe the wealth of those responsible.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not to be outdone by any
legislature,
the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of compensating landowners for
environmental &#8220;takings&#8221;, but has remained silent about landowners
compensating the public for any &#8220;givings&#8221;</span>, as when site values
skyrocket near a new light rail stop. Molly Ivins wrote, </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"Henry George must be in his
grave

That&#8217;s how great fortunes are made: by sloughing off private costs
(which become &#8220;negative externalities&#8221;) while soaking up public
benefits (some &#8220;positive externalities&#8221;). </span>Land titles,
corporate
charters, and other privileges &#8211; mere pieces of paper &#8211; are worth
trillions each year. The corporations &#8211; from the Federal Reserve to
Exxon (both founded by the &#8220;oiligarchy&#8221;) &#8211; that receive these
privileges make their owners rich or richer. <span

compensation for the exertions of either labor or capital, not profit

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to

land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The most frequently heard
arguments for reducing capital gains
taxes are: 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>(1) to reduce the <span

(4) to end alleged double taxation of both capital stocks and income

<small>This report calls attention to a neglected aspect of the capital
gains
issue --&nbsp; one which bears importantly on the fifth- and
sixth-named
consequences.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Much of the capital gains debate today focuses on the stock
market.
Business recipients of capital gains are characterized as small
innovative firms making <span style="font-weight: bold;">initial
public offerings (IPOs)</span>. In recent
years such firms have been responsible for a disproportionate share of
new hiring. It is hoped that corporations will be able to raise money
to employ more labor and invest in more plant and equipment if buyers
of their stocks can sell these securities with less of a tax bite.
Stock market gains thus are held to stimulate new direct investment,
employment, and output.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Typical of the campaign to reduce capital gains taxes is a Wall
Street
Journal editorial, &#8220;Capital Gains: Lift the Burden.&#8221; Author W. Kurt
Hauser argues that when the capital gains tax rate was increased from
20 percent to 28 percent in 1989, the effect was to deter asset sales,
causing a decline in the capital gains to be reaped and taxed. He
refers, however, only to stock market gains, and specifically, to
equity in small businesses. Citing the example of yacht producers, he
suggests that taxing capital gains on stocks issued by these businesses
&#8220;locks in&#8221; capital asset sales, thereby deterring new investment and
hiring, and reducing the supply of yachts.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Others contend that new productive investment is relatively
insensitive
to capital gains tax rates, arguing, for example, that most of the
money placed in venture-capital funds come from tax-exempt pension
funds, endowments, and foundations.</small><small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>What
is missing from the discussion is a sense of
proportion as to how capital gains are made. Data that is available
from the Department of Commerce, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve Board
indicate that <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">roughly
two thirds of the economy's capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains are taken, not in
the stock market -- much less in new offerings -- but in real </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">estate. ... </span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No capital gains duties are levied
on estates passing to heirs. Indeed,
inheritors of real estate may begin re-depreciating their
income-yielding buildings afresh at the new (typically higher) transfer
price. The estates bequeathed by the richest one percent of the
population (over $600,000
in value) are now taxed at a 55 percent rate if not sheltered, but of
course these are the estates most likely to shelter inheritance and
gift bequests. For instance, assets given as gifts are taxed only at
the time they come to be sold.<small> If
the capital gains tax were reduced or abolished, the deferral would
become
permanent.</small><br>
<br>
Most capital gains reaped by business partnerships accrue to real
estate firms, which shelter personal income by avoiding incorporation.
IRS statistics ranking capital gains in terms of how long the assets
were held show that many of these gains represent quick &#8220;flips." Often
these are land that has been rezoned from a low-value to a high-value
use. Retaining the capital gains tax would have little effect on
deterring such speculation.<br>
<br>
Properties held for longer periods of time by these partnerships
typically are sold or swapped after having been fully depreciated.
Swaps&#8217; have long been permitted to the real, many almost perpetually
free of income taxation. The logic for this
loophole seems at first glance to be much like that for personal
homeowners&#8217; exemptions in selling a home to move somewhere else,
without having to pay a capital gain tax in the process; but the
analogy is specious. Homeowners cannot take a depreciation tax credit
unless their property generates rental income, and most do not generate
any income against which to claim CCAs<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">31</span>. In
contrast, the capital gains which commercial real estate investors
record for income-tax purposes are calculated, not merely on the gain
in the property&#8217;s market price (as with owner-occupied homes), but on
the excess of selling price over depreciated book value. </small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small><small><font size="-1">31 Homeowners do receive
imputed
rental income, which is not subject to the income tax.</font><br>
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>Major commercial real
estate investors such as pension funds, insurance
companies and other large institutions are exempt from capital gains
taxes, as are foreign investors. In addition to playing a dominant role
in real estate, these institutional investors own nearly half of all
U.S. equities.<strong> ... </strong><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Reported capital gains in real
estate were understated as a result of
exclusions. On the other hand, much direct investment included the cost
of land, commercial buildings, and plant and equipment. Taking this
into account, we estimate that roughly 70 percent of the capital gains
calculated by the IRS for 1985 probably represent real estate. Even
this estimate may understate the role of land and real estate. In 1985,
anticipating the planned 1986 tax reform which would raise the capital
gains tax rate from 20 to 28 percent, many investors sold their
securities that had registered the largest advances. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Some 40 percent of the capital gains reaped
by selling these stocks probably represented real estate gains.</span>
A major spur to the LBO movement driving up the stock market was an
awareness that real estate gains were not being reflected in book
values and share prices;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">36</span> as
land prices leapt upward-funded in part by looser regulatory
restrictions on S&amp;L lending against land -- raiders bought publicly
traded companies and sold off their assets, including real estate, to
pay off their junk-bond backers. In effect, not only were rental income
and profits being converted into a flow of interest payments; so also
were capital gains.<strong> ... </strong></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Political
Context of Real Estate Taxation</span><br>
Much of the public discussion of capital gains policy has been
conducted with little reference to empirical research as to their
actual character and composition in the US economy. Capital gains, and
savings in general, are defended on the assumption that they are
automatically transformed into new direct investment. Yet the more
layers has the debt pyramid, the smaller is the proportion of savings
used to finance direct investment. Moreover, our investigation suggests
that a large and expanding share of the economy's capital gains -- as
they are defined, measured and taxed -- has little discernible impact
on net investment or employment.<br>
<br>
IRS estimates of capital gains measure only the small proportion that
individuals are obliged to declare after all the exemptions and
exclusions have been utilized. There is no estimate of the volume of
capital gains generated each year, and no adequate breakdown as to
where these gains occur. This statistical lacuna means that the
economic cost of assorted tax loopholes is not being calculated. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">There is no sound
statistical basis for calculating the total returns being taken by
investors, or the proportion of those returns paid in </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">taxes.<br>
<br>
</span>When statistics are lacking, it often is because some interest
groups are benefiting in ways they prefer not to see quantified and
publicized. If land assessments lag behind actual increases in market
value, for instance, land speculators, as well as homeowners, will pay
less than their legislated tax share. Also -- and of direct relevance
to
our thesis -- the failure to distinguish statistics on land values and
other real estate gains from non-real-estate capital gains in industry
and finance makes it easier for the real estate industry to get its own
taxes reduced along with industries in which capital gains tax cuts do
indeed tend to spur productivity.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Academic economists likewise
  have been remarkably slow to address this
  shift away from earned income to capital gains. It is true that
  nineteenth-century land reformers such as John Stuart Mill and Leon
  Wahas defined land-value gains as an &#8220;unearned increment,&#8221; and
  urged that they be collected by the community at large, whose economic
  activity was, after all, responsible for creating these gains. Ever
  since Henry George brought matters to a head in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span> (1879),
  however, economics has largely dropped the analysis of land-value
  gains, and indeed, of land itself.</small></p>
  <p><small>Wealthy
    investors have won congressional support for
    real estate exemptions in large part by mobilizing the economic
    ambitions of homeowners. Most families&#8217; major asset, after all, is
    their home. Two Federal Reserve studies trace the rise in gross house
    value from 26 percent of household wealth in 1962 to 30.1 percent in
    1983 (falling back to 28.5 percent in 1989).<small> </small>
    Household real estate assets substantially exceeded holdings of stocks,
    bonds and trust funds (20.5 percent in 1989), liquid assets (17
    percent) and total debt (14 percent).<small></small> The
    giveaway to real estate interests is thus presented ostensibly as a
    popular middle class measure. The real estate industry (and the
    financial sector riding on its shoulders) have found that the middle
    classes are willing to cut taxes on the wealthy considerably, as long
    as their own taxes are cut even lightly. It is no surprise that
    President Clinton&#8217;s first major concession to the pressure for cutting
    capital gains taxation is directed at homeowners, despite the fact that
    preferences for home ownership cannot be justified as a boost to
    entrepreneurial investment. Such is the foreshortened economic
  perspective of our times.</small></p>
  <p>    <small>The LBO movement epitomizes the real estate industry&#8216;s strategy,
  applying the developer&#8217;s traditional debt-pyramiding techniques to the
  buying and selling of manufacturing companies. Raiders emulated
  developers who borrowed money to buy or construct buildings and make
  related capital improvements, agreeing to pay interest to their
  mortgage bankers or other lenders, putting down as little equity of
  their own as possible. Having set things in motion, the landlord uses
  the rental income to carry the interest, principal, taxes and
  maintenance charges while he waits for a capital gain to accrue. The
  idea is to amortize the loan as slowly as possible so as to minimize
  annual carrying charges, while paying them out of the CCA.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>For many decades securities analysts have pored over corporate
  balance
  sheets in search of undervalued real estate whose book value does not
  reflect gains in market value. From the merger and acquisition movement
  of the 1960s through the takeover wave of the&nbsp;1980s,
  the raider&#8217;s strategy has been to borrow money to buy the target
  company&#8217;s stock, and then sell off its real estate and other assets to
  repay the creditors, hoping that something will be left for himself
  after settling the debts incurred in the process. For the bankers and
  other creditors, LBOs were a way to put savings to work earning higher
  rates of interest.&nbsp; The ensuing junk bond commotion pushed
  interest rates over 15 percent for high-risk securities, whose major
  risk was that quick capital gains and the cash flow available from
  re-depreciating properties would not cover the interest payments to the
  institutional investors rounded up by Drexel Burnham and the other
  investment bankers who underwrote the takeovers.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The object of building, like buying and selling companies, is
  thus by
  no means only to earn rental income. Most cash flow is pledged to
  lenders as debt service in any case. In a world of income taxation
  subject to loopholes, sophisticated investors aim not so much to make
  profits as to reap capital gains -not only in the stock and bond
  markets, but also in real estate, other natural resources, and the
  monopoly privileges that have come to underlie much of the pricing of
  securities today.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>As developers borrow money to finance real estate purchases,
  lenders,
  for their part, use the real estate sector as a market to absorb and
  service the economy's mounting stock of savings, applying most of the
  rental cash flow to pay interest to savers. The end result is that most
  total returns are taken by the wealthiest ten percent responsible for
  nearly all the economy's net saving. Viewing US economic statistics
  from this perspective shows that not to calculate capital gains in the
  national income accounts alongside directly &#8220;earned&#8221; income helps
  foster the illusion that more equality exists among Americans than
  actually is the case. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The fact is
  that earned income is more equally distributed than unearned gains. </span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>This distinction between real estate (and by extension, other
  natural
  resource industries and monopolies) and the rest of the economy helps
  explain the familiar economic rule that inequalities of wealth tend
  historically to exceed inequalities of income. The reason is that the
  wealthiest layers of society control even more of the economy's assets
  -- and the capital gains on these assets -- than they do its income.
  They
  also obtain a larger proportion of cash flow and other non-taxable
  income than they do of taxable &#8220;earned&#8221; income. </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>This phenomenon has long been known, but not well explained.
  Edward
  Wolff has shown that wealth is more unequally distributed than income,
  but he leaves capital gains out of account in explaining how the
  American economy has grown more top-heavy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span></small> It is
  unequal wealth that is primarily responsible for generating inequality
  of incomes. The more the returns to wealth can avoid taxation by being
  categorized as capital gains, the faster this inequality will polarize
  society.</small>  </p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>43 Wolff (1995), p. 27.
&#8220;The top
one percent of wealth holders
has typically held in excess of one-quarter of total household wealth,
in comparison to the 8 or 9 percent share of income received by the top
percentile of the income distribution.&#8221;</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Given the current US depreciation laws and
related
institutions, to lower the capital gains tax rate across the board is
to steer capital and entrepreneurial resources into a search for
unearned rather than earned income. It rewards real estate speculators
and corporate raiders as it shifts the burden of taxation to people
whose primary source of income is their labor. The budget crisis
aggravated by such a policy also ends up forcing public resources to be
sold off to meet current expenses -- sold to the very wealth-holders
being
freed from taxation. In this way wealth consolidates its economic power
relative to the rest of society, and translates it into political power
so as to shit? the tax burden onto the shoulders of others. The first
element of this strategy has been to defer revenue into channels that
are taxed only later, as capital gains. The second has been to tax
these gains at a lower rate than earned income -- a&nbsp; fight that
has broken
out in earnest following the 1996 presidential elections.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Taxation of capital gains is widely attacked as a &#8220;soak the rich&#8221;
scheme, a program of wealth redistribution that will adversely affect
growth in productivity and efficiency. Kurt Hauser&#8217;s Wall Street
Journal editorial counters this with the observation that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">over half of all taxpayers</span>
reporting capital gains have adjusted gross incomes of under $50,000,
implying that a tax cut would not preferentially benefit the wealthy. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">He neglects to observe, however, that the
poorer half of taxpayers account for less than ten percent of the total
dollar value of capital gains<small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic;">46</span></small></small> -- or</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> that the capital gains tax is virtually
the only remaining federal levy on real estate income.</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Low capital gains tax rates and
the
tax deductibility of mortgage interest have contributed to the
polarization of wealth distribution.</span> A further reduction in the
capital
gains rate would worsen this maldistribution by making real estate
virtually tax-free except for local property taxes, which fell from
10 percent to just 7.4 percent of all taxes at all levels of government
between 1955 and 1989.<small><span

<p><small><small>  </small><span style="font-style: italic;">Time </span>columnist John
  Rothschild recently accused opponents of a capital gains tax cut of
  resisting &#8220;any reform, no matter how it may benefit society in
  general,&#8221; simply &#8220;so that the rich cannot benefit."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">48</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The point, however, is that
  the tax code encourages the wealthy to enrich themselves in ways that
  are detrimental to the economy at large</span>. The presumed trade-off
  between equity and efficiency is mythical, at least with respect to
  real estate under the current federal tax code. 
  </small> The
  implication is that any resulting growth in income inequality is the
  price a free society must pay for an efficient system of economic
  incentives. Indeed, it would be difficult to oppose widely shared
  progress simply because the rich are gaining faster than the rest of
  society.
</p>
<p><small><small>
    </small>    </small><small>An inordinate focus on stock market gains -- especially the
    selection of small industrial companies such as a yacht producer just making
    his first
    stock offering -- diverts attention from the extent to which a low capital
    gains tax benefits real estate investors preferentially. The irony of casting
    the issue
    in terms of the stock market rather than real estate investment is that financial
    investors have already devised an array of strategies to evade taxation on
    stock gains. Institutional investors already are exempt from capital gains
    taxes on
    securities, as they are on their real estate holdings. Wealthy individual investors
    can arrange fictitious &#8220;short&#8221; sales (&#8220;sales against the box&#8221;),
    obtaining the proceeds of their stocks without having to actually sell them,
    by collateralizing them with a bank and borrowing an amount of money equal to
    the value of the stocks. This is the equivalent of a sale, for it provides immediate
    proceeds -- but without incurring taxes
    on the securities&#8217; rise in value. Bankers find this a lucrative business,
    while the Treasury foregoes revenue at the expense of less affluent taxpayers.
    To abolish capital gains taxes would enable these
    fictitious &#8220;against the box&#8221; maneuverings finally to be liquidated
    without having paid any taxes. Also freed would be the accumulated over-depreciation
    of buildings that has sheltered past real estate
    income.<br>
    <br style="font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">If the intention is to provide an
    incentive for new direct investment, employment, and industrial
    modernization, then an across-the-board capital gains tax cut is at
    best a blunt policy instrument.</span> We have examined several reasons
    to doubt that further cuts in capital gains taxes will have a
    pronounced incentive effect on new direct investment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">49</span></small>
    Capital gains tend to reward accumulation of old assets more than
    production of new wealth. The stock market is mostly a second-hand
    market, but we do not lean too hard on this point because the
    (discounted) anticipation of future capital gains may boost the demand
    for new stock issues, making it somewhat easier for corporations to
    finance new investment. The main point is that most taxable capital
    gains represent appreciation of non-produced land and of structures
    built years ago. In the current institutional setting, real estate
    gains are artificially inflated by generous depreciation rules, which
    apply not only to newly constructed buildings but also to second-hand
    buildings and even, effectively, to land, which neither depreciates nor
    is replaced. As long as these and other rules are in place, an
    across-the-board capital gains tax cut will preferentially benefit real
    estate and financial speculation at the expense of industrial
    production. It will also increase the federal budget deficit,
    ultimately at the expense of lower- and middle-income taxpayers.
    </small>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>49 A capital gains tax
cut may
relieve a lock-in effect caused by
taxing capital gains upon realization instead of accrual. However,
Gaffney (199 l), p. 50, writes that &#8220;the locked-in effect results
mainly from stepup at death, rather than from a high rate per se.&#8221;</small></small></div>
<small><small><br>
</small>One reason often cited for taxing capital gains at lower rates
than ordinary income is to exempt &#8220;phantom income&#8221; arising from
inflation. The logic of indexing is that if prices rise by, say, 50
percent between the time of purchase and the time of sale, then this
amount should not be taxed; to do so would be to tax investors just for
&#8220;staying in place.&#8221; However, inflation erodes all monetary assets, not
just capital gains,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">50</span></small> and
may erode the purchasing power of labor income, as has occurred for
most wage-earners in recent years. Equity in the face of inflation is
thus a poor argument for preferential capital
gains tax rates. </small><small>... </small><a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/how_to_help_the_unemployed.html">How
    to Help the Unemployed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1894) </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... For the question of the
unemployed is
but a more than usually acute phase of the great labor question -- a
question of the distribution of wealth.&nbsp; Now, given any wrong, no
matter what, that affects the distribution of wealth, and it follows
that the leading class must be averse to any examination or question
of it. For, since wealth is power, the leading class is necessarily
dominated by those who profit or imagine they profit by injustice in
the distribution of wealth. Hence, the very indisposition to ask the
cause of evils so great as to arouse and startle the whole community
is but proof that they spring from some wide and deep injustice.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What that injustice is may be seen
by whoever will really look. We
have only to ask to find.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Scarcity of employment" is a
comparatively new complaint in the
United States. In our earlier times it was never heard of or thought
of. There was "scarcity of employment " in Europe, but on this side
of the Atlantic the trouble -- so it was deemed by a certain class --
was "scarcity of labor." It was because of this "scarcity of labor "
that negroes were imported from Africa and indentured apprentices
from the Old Country, that men who could not pay their passage sold
their labor for a term of years to get here, and that that great
stream of immigration from the Old World that has done so much to
settle this continent set in. Now, why was there "scarcity of
employment" on one side of the Atlantic and "scarcity of labor" on
the other? What was the cause of this difference, of which all other
social and political differences were but consequences? Adam Smith
saw it, and in his "Wealth of Nations" states it, but it did not need
an Adam Smith for that, as everyone who knew anything of the two
countries knew it. It was, that in this country land was cheap and
easy to get, while in Europe land was dear and hard to get. Land has
been steadily growing dear in the United States, and as a consequence
we hear no longer of "scarcity of labor." We hear now of "scarcity of
employment."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the first quarter of this
century an educated and thoughtful
Englishman, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, visited this country. He saw its
great resources, and noted the differences between the
English-speaking society growing up here and that to which he had
been used. Viewing everything from the standpoint of a class
accustomed to look on the rest of mankind as created for their
benefit, 'what he deemed the great social and economic disadvantage
of the United States was "the scarcity of labor." It was to this he
traced the rudeness of even what he styled the upper class, its want
of those refinements, enjoyments, and delicacies of life common to
the aristocracy of England. How could an English gentleman emigrate
to a country where labor was so dear that he might actually have to
black his own boots; so dear that even the capitalist might have to
work, and no one could count on a constant supply ready to accept as
a boon any opportunity to perform the most menial, degrading, and
repulsive services? Mr. Wakefield was not a man to note facts without
seeking their connection. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He
saw that this "scarcity of labor" came
from the cheapness of land where the vast area of the public domain
was open for settlement at nominal prices.</span> A man of his class
and
time, without the slightest question that land was made to be owned
by landlords, and laborers were made to furnish a supply of labor for
the upper classes, he was yet a man of imagination. He saw the future
before the English-speaking race in building up new nations in what
were yet the waste spaces of the earth. But he wished those new
nations to be socially, politically, and economically newer Englands;
not to be settled as the United States had been, from the "lower
classes" alone, but to contain from the first a proper proportion of
the "upper classes" as well. He saw that "scarcity of employment"
would in time succeed "scarcity of labor" even in countries like the
United States by the growth of speculation in land; but he did not
want to wait for that in the newer Britains which his imagination
pictured. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He proposed at
once to produce such salutary "scarcity of
employment " in new colonies as would give cheap and abundant labor,
by a governmental refusal to sell public land, save at a price so
high as to prevent the poorer from getting land, thus compelling them
to offer their labor for hire.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">This
was the essential part of what was once well known as the
Wakefield plan of colonization.</span> It is founded on a correct
theory. In
any country, however new and vast, it would be possible to change
"scarcity of labor" into "scarcity of employment" by increasing the
price put on the use of land. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If
three families settled a virgin
continent, one family could command the services of the others as
laborers for hire just as fully as though they were its chattel
slaves, if it was accorded the ownership of the land and could put
its own price on its use.</span> Wakefield proposed only that land
should be
held at what he called "a sufficient price" -- that is, a price high
enough to keep wages in new colonies only a little higher than wages
in the mother-country, and to produce not actual inability to get
employment on the part of laborers, but only such difficulty as would
keep them tractable, and ready to accept what from his standpoint
were reasonable wages. Yet it is evident that it would only require a
somewhat greater increase in the price of land to go beyond this
point and to bring about in the midst of abundant natural
opportunities for the employment of labor, the phenomena of laborers
vainly seeking employment. Now, in the United States we have not
attempted to create "scarcity of employment" by Wakefield's plan. But
we have made haste by sale and gift to put the public domain in the
hands of private owners, and thus allowed speculation to bring about
more quickly and effectually than he could have anticipated, more
than Wakefield aimed at. The public domain is now practically gone;
land is rising to European prices, and we are at last face to face
with social difficulties which in the youth of men of my time we were
wont to associate with "the effete monarchies of the Old World."<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Today, as the last census reports show, the majority of American
farmers are rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the first
form of tenancy; and the great majority of our people are landless
men, without right to employ their own labor and without stake in the
land they still foolishly speak of as their country. This is the
reason why the army of the unemployed has appeared among us, why by
pauperism has already become chronic, and why in the tramp we have in
more dangerous type the proletarian of ancient Rome.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These recurring spasms of business
stagnation; these long-drawn
periods of industrial depression, common to the civilized world, do
not come from our treatment of money; are not caused and are not to
be cured by changes of tariffs. Protection is a robbery of labor, and
what is called free trade would give some temporary relief, but
speculation in land would only set in the stronger, and at last labor
and capital would again resist, by partial cessation, the blackmail
demanded for their employment in production, and the same round would
be run again. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">There is but
one remedy, and that is what is now known
as the single-tax -- the abolition of all taxes upon labor and
capital, and of all taxes upon their processes and products, and the
taking of economic rent, the unearned increment which now goes to the
mere appropriator, for the payment of public expenses. Charity can
merely demoralize and pauperize,</span> while that indirect form of
charity,
the attempt to artificially "make work" by increasing public expenses
and by charity woodyards and sewing-rooms, is still more dangerous.
If, in this sense, work is to be made, it can be made more quickly by
dynamite and kerosene.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But there is no need for charity;
no need for "making work." All
that is needed is to remove the restrictions that prevent the natural
demand for the products of work from availing itself of the natural
supply. Remove them today, and every unemployed man in the country
could find for himself employment tomorrow, and his "effective
demand" for the things he desires would infuse new life into every
subdivision of business and industry, even that of the dentist, the
preacher, the magazine writer, or the actor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
country is suffering from
"scarcity of employment." But let
anyone to-day attempt to employ his own labor or that of others,
whether in making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, or
in erecting a factory, and he will at once meet the speculator to
demand of him an unnatural price for the land he must use, and the
tax-gatherer to fine him for his act in employing labor as if he had
committed a crime. </span>The common-sense way to cure "scarcity of
employment" is to take taxes off the products and processes of
employment and to impose in their stead the tax that would end
speculation in land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But, it will be said, this is not
quick enough. On the contrary,
it is quicker than anything else. Even the public recognition of its
need, by but a part of the intelligence and influence that is now
devoted to charity appeals and schemes, would have such an effect
upon the speculative price of land as to at once set labor and
capital to work.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The heart of George&#8217;s economics
was, in a way, Biblical. As the son of
a religious book publisher born in Philadelphia, he had adequate
opportunity to witness the early growth of the American republic in a
unique way. On his own in San Francisco and responsible for a wife and
child at a young age, his first effort at resolving the puzzles of
injustice were a manuscript printed in 1871. But only after additional
exposure to Ricardian rent theory was he able to refine his ideas such
that they could form the basis of his <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span> eight years
later. His Christian roots led him to a deep commitment to the basic
moral equality of all people; his challenge was to find a way to ensure
that this equality was manifest in economic fairness.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As noted earlier, the starting point of Georgist philosophy is
that
nature belongs to owners only in usufruct and not in freehold. Because
any monetary wealth that accrued to that nature stemmed directly from
the physical presence of people and was therefore social in character,
the resulting added increment of value that constituted rent belonged
in turn to the community that created it. Nature would have no economic
price without people. Hence rent was the community&#8217;s entitlement and
not that of individuals, and the land rent that accrued to parcels as a
result of social investment should be returned to &#8212; recaptured by &#8212; the
community. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It was obvious to George
that the wealthiest people in the nation usually owed their fortune not
to the sweat of their brow or the inventiveness of their minds. Rather
their position was due to their success as land speculators, to an
increase in rent on land they had captured title to, land rightfully
belonging to all. </span>The earth and all its product, he argued, was
the common heritage of humanity, a birthright of all people. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Any failure to pay back
that increment to society, or of government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. He witnessed first
hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development&#8212; even in his
time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. He
witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. He realized that people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. It was not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington
Plunkett writing at the same time:</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">There&#8217;s
an honest graft, and I&#8217;m an example of how it works. I might sum up the

<br style="font-style: italic;">
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Just let me explain by
examples. My party&#8217;s in power in the city, and it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to undertake

going to lay out a new park in a certain place.</span><span

<br>
I see my opportunity and I take it. I go to that place and I buy up all
the land I can in the neighborhood. Then the board of this or that
makes its plan public, and there is a rush to get my land, which nobody
cared particularly for before.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All society needed to do was to collect the
economic rent from
landholders as its rightful due, a solution that became part of the
subtitle of his book, &#8220;the remedy.&#8221; Taxing the land (or, alternatively,
collecting the economic rent) was something common citizens could
understand.</small><br>
<br>
<small>They knew well the enormous disparity in fortune between the
landed and
the landless. They knew also that there was in fact land enough for
all, except for a system of ownership that made no distinction between
the right of land use and the right of land gain. George had no doubt
read Frenchman P. J. Proudhon&#8217;s more strident pamphlet that &#8220;property
is theft.&#8221; <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">33</span></small>
He knew that there was a long tradition of land taxation, well
articulated by a French school of philosophers known as the
Physiocrats. It was a natural and comprehensible solution for him to
advocate the adoption of the &#8220;single tax&#8221; on land, according to its
market value, to collect the economic rent. ... <a

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"><small><small>A Clarion Call to Sanity, to Honesty, to
Justice</small></small></a>&nbsp; (1982)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let us begin this study of the
likely causes of our troubles by
asking two questions: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are we over-populated? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are the earth's
resources inadequate for this population? 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our stage, of course, for
making this study will be this world of ours, for it is upon this
world that the drama of human living is played out, with all its joys
and all its sorrows, with all its great achievements and all its
failures, with all its nobilities and all its wickedness.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Regardless of its size relative to
other planets, with its
circumference of about twenty-five thousand miles, to any mere mortal
who must walk to the station and back each day, it is huge. Roughly
ninety-six million miles separate the sun from the earth on the
latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this distance, the
earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and it spins
on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's rays are
distributed far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage and
maximizing their benefits.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider the complementarity of
nature in the case of the two
forms of life we call vegetable and animal, in their respective uses
of the two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, the waste product of
each serving as the life-giving force of the other. Any increase in
the one will encourage a like response in the other.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marvel at the manner in which
nature, with no help from man or
beast, delivers pure water to the highest lands, increasing it as to
their elevation, thus affording us a free ride downstream and free
power as we desire it. Look with awe at the variety and quantity of
minerals with which this world is blessed, and finally at the
fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both animal and
vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels from a single
stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of this year's
crop; then think of the vastly greater yields from a single cherry
pit or the seeds of a single apple, or grape or watermelon; or,
turning to the animal world, consider the hen who averages almost an
egg a day and the spawning fish as examples of the prolificacy that
is evident throughout the whole of the animal world, including
mankind.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If this marvelous earth is as rich
in resources as portrayed in
the foregoing paragraph, then the problem must be one of
distribution: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>how is the land distributed among the earth's
inhabitants, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>how are its products in turn distributed?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land is universally treated as
either public property or private
property. Wars are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated as common
property.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George has described this world as
a "well-provisioned ship" and
when one considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals of such
provisions as coal and petroleum as have occurred say over the past
one hundred years, one must but agree with this writer. But this is
only a static view. Consider the suggestion of some ten years ago
that it would require the conversion of less than 20% the of the
current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the motors
then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The dynamic picture
of the future is indeed awesome, and there is every indication that
that characteristic has the potential of endless expansion. <b>So how
is it that on so richly endowed a Garden of Eden as this world of
ours we have only been able to make of it a hell on earth for vast
numbers of people?</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The answers are simple: we have
permitted, nay we have even more
than that, encouraged, the gross misallocation of resources and a
viciously wicked distribution of wealth, and we choose to be governed
by those whom we, in our ignorance, have elected.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In our economy, land is a ready
object of speculation, and its
value is constantly reflecting this evil. What happens in a rising
market, the up side of a business cycle, is that investors see rising
prices in land as indicative of a boom. Thereupon, they try to
increase their holdings in such land, only to discover that their
present returns will not pay for the present costs of land; the
current price of land is not based on what the yield of that land is
today, but on what it is projected to be two or three years from now.
The difference tends to increase until a point is reached where the
imarginal buyer of land suddenly finds himself unable to meet the
rising costs to which he has subjected himself. With bankruptcy
threatening him or having already been forced upon him, the land
passes from his hands, and the market temporarily becomes overpriced.
The bankruptcies increase, and ultimately land values are brought
back to levels which represent current productivity, at which point
the new boom will have started. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The wringing out of land
speculation from the dynamics of
economics will remove that unacknowledged offence which has so
labored the economic profession and the public at large. As Henry
George discovered and as <a href="Hoyt.html">Homer Hoyt</a> so brilliantly depicted
speculative land prices as the cause of this bitter cycle, so will
its removal rid society of this hitherto hidden defect. It will put
the land market on a current value basis and eliminate the terrible
risks to which that market has always been subject in the past.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The reason for such speculation
under the present practices is
obvious. All products of labor are subject to increases or decreases
depending on supply and demand. When an oversupply of any commodity
begins to rear its ugly head, prices tend downward and production is
thereby lessened until there is a contrary swing upward. Land, on the
other hand, is of fixed supply. Nothing man does can increase or
decrease the amount of land, and therefore that brake that operates
in the field of production does not apply to land values and
prices.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Just think of the social benefits
that would accrue to a society
that could, at a stroke, rid itself of the potential hazards to which
all prior societies have been so subject. Production will then occur
on a steadily rising level, demand increases as the well-being of
society improves, new techniques develop, new inventions are made,
and all these will be benefits to the community as a whole, and not
just to the land-owners as in the past. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Back in the early days of this
century, <a href="../docs/Churchill_TPL.html">Winston Churchill</a> saw and
recorded an example of this. There had been a ferry fare over the
river Thames for the common laborers who lived on the wrong side of
the river to pay in order to get to work. A spirit of nobility
prompted the absorption of this fare by the City, and almost
immediately rents in the working class area were increased by the
same amount as the fare had been. When this thing was done, the guys
who got the benefit were not the poor working class people, but the
owners of the homes in which they lived, or, more accurately and more
critically, the owners of the land on which those homes stood. The
laborers were thus charged a higher rent, and that rent diverted the
benefit from the seemingly intended beneficiary (i.e., the public) to
landowners in the affected area.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This occurs every day in this
country. A new road is built, or a
superhighway is constructed, which makes access to a particular site
much easier. We tell ourselves that we justify this as an
expenditure of public funds by the benefits that accrue to the
traveling public; but the benefits go, in the form of higher land
prices and rents, to the owners of the sites that are served by this
new road. If you doubt this, consider the jockeying for the insider
information or for influence over the selection.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Robert Caro, in his biography of
Robert Moses, recalls the time in
the early 1920s that Moses suggested to the authorities the building
of a causeway from the Long Island mainland over to Jones Island.
This proposal was rejected outright by the Long Island Park
Commission. Some months later, Moses presented them with a drawing
showing precisely where this causeway would run, and, after a
suitable period of during which these public employees could buy up
the land along the proposed highway, he resubmitted his proposal.
This time, they officially approved the suggested construction.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the town of Antioch, Illinois,
there were two developments
underway almost simultaneously. In the one, roads were provided,
together with water and sewer lines, but no sidewalks; in the other,
just across a main road from the first, the mayor of the city had
storm sewers, curbs and sidewalks installed at public expense, for
which of course, any prospective buyer or tenant would gladly pay for
use of that land the higher price these added benefits provided. Any
reader will recognize this chain of events and set of economic
relationships as being the course of everyday life and business at
the local, state and national level. <b>The cynic would say that a
primary motivation for entering local or even national politics would
be the opportunity for personal gain offered daily by publicly
financed improvements. ...
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus, the benefits of a
tax-supported public work accrued once
more not to the benefit of the public at large, but to that of a very
limited and narrowly defined class, those who were rich enough to own
land in that location.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are undoubtedly many other
problems to be resolved before
the ills of our society are cured; but what many do not recognize and
understand is the primacy of the adoption of land value taxation over
all these other corrections. The reason for that can be very simply
stated: <b>If any of these other measures already adopted have no
merit and have only added to the burden of our problems, then they
are disqualified at the outset. On the other hand, if they are of
themselves beneficial, any benefit from them will be immediately
capitalized into land values and will therefore exacerbate the very
problems which otherwise might be helped toward a cure.</b> Thus it
is that our first step toward any possible remedy for the awesome
plight into which we have been led increasingly over the recent years
must be the adoption of land value taxation.&nbsp; ... <a

    about the
    mansions of rich people?</b>" Another fair question: how, indeed, can
    you justify exempting them from taxation? The answer may astonish
    you. Here are some data from British Columbia that speak to the
    point. They are from the area around Vancouver (The "Lower Mainland")
    and the southern part of Vancouver Island, around Victoria, where
    over half the people in the province live. B.C. practices high
    quality professional assessment; data from its rolls are quite
    reliable, as such things go.</small></div>
  <div style="text-align: left;"><small>&nbsp;Cities and districts around Vancouver and Victoria are
    ranked, in<a

    Table 1</a>,
    according to the land value per property (single-family residences).
    These range from nearly $700,000 each in the "University Endowment
    Lands" district (very posh), to around $40,000 each in the "Victoria
    Rural" district (more modest). The last column, LSREV (Land Share of
    Real Estate Value), shows the land value (L) as a share of the total
    value (B+L).</small>&nbsp;

      follow the trend closely. The dearer the land parcels, the higher is
      the "land fraction" (the fraction of total real estate value that is
      land value). From such data, one might formulate a rule along the
      lines that "the lot value increases with the square of the house
      value." It is hard to be so precise, and not necessary. <span

    very rich family is worth 2.8 times the house of the modest family;
    but the land under the house of the very rich is worth 17.5 times the

    it is lot value, more than building value, that divides the rich from
    the poor. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Seldom
    will you find an economic rule more strongly

  <div style="text-align: left;"><small>An American counterpart of Vancouver's "University Endowment
    Lands" is <b>Beverly Hills, California, where land value composes
    some 80% of residential values</b>, and the mean parcel is worth
    something like a million dollars. Beverly Hills, with its great
    wealth and mansions, is known as "Tear-down City." Every year many a
    grand old palace that once sheltered some renowned matinee idol, and
    rang to scandalous parties, is torn down to salvage its site for the
    next, grander one. In a land boom, such as crested in 1989, half the
    city goes to the brink of demolition and replacement.</small></div>
  <div style="text-align: left;"><small>&nbsp;What do those data tell us? The rich as a rule do not
    live
    next to the poor. Rather, they cluster in neighborhoods with much
    higher lot values. <b>The poor seek shelter first, and go where it is
    affordable.</b> The rich put a high premium on location,
    neighborhood, views, and grounds, resulting in higher land fractions
    in their real estate. Mansions are visible evidences of wealth,
    impressing viewers powerfully; land values are invisible. The
    perceptual bias is to underrate the invisible, if you are not
    regularly in the real estate market. In the numbers, however, land
    and buildings are equally visible, and their message is clear.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">It
    is land value more than house value that divides the rich from the
    poor. Ergo, a tax shift from buildings to land is a shift from the
    poor to the rich, even though the houses of the rich are exempted. It
    makes the property tax more progressive.</span> </b></small></div>
  <div style="text-align: left;"><small>&nbsp;To be sure, those data are grouped by separate
    municipalities,
    not
    neighborhoods within municipalities. The poor of Colwood cannot tax
    the rich in the UEL, except through a higher level of government.
    However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">what is true among
    municipalities is also true among
    neighborhoods within municipalities.</span> Indeed, if we divided
    Vancouver
    into neighborhoods, the contrasts might be sharper than those shown.
    The UEL, for example, is really just a neighborhood in Vancouver
    that, for historical reasons, happens to be reported on separately.
    Harold Brodsky has done neighborhood comparisons in Washington, D.C.;
    Margaret Reid in Chicago; Richard Muth in various cities. They tell
    the same story. If we are very lucky, some Institute or Foundation
    concerned with land policy will see the importance of this question,
    and support teams of researchers and graduate students testing the
    point in a dozen American cities. San Francisco, with its scores of
    well-defined neighborhoods, would be a natural. Compare exclusive St.
    Francis Woods (top of the line) with the crowded Richmond District,
    and both with Visitacion Valley (the pits). I surmise the findings
    would reinforce those presented above. Meantime, nothing stops you

    Conflict Between Protecting Expectations and Moral Evolution</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Power,
    Population and Process</b></p>
  <p>There are two other difficulties that are more serious. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, the existing distribution of recognized exclusive rights to natural
          opportunities (land, mineral resources, fishing rights, water rights,
      etc.) is the outcome of a game of power, and those who have won at this
      game have
          great power are loathe to part with their winnings.</li>
    <li>Second, Malthusian analysis has led people to expect that if the value
          of exclusive use of natural opportunities were distributed equally,
      population would expand until everyone was at a subsistence level.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is a solution to the second problem, contained in the idea that all
      persons have equal rights to the use of natural opportunities. If the crowding
      effects of additional persons outweigh the beneficial effects of greater economies
      of scale, then any region that has an above-average population growth rate
      is appropriating more than its share of the scarce natural opportunity to be
      a parent. The costs that this region thereby imposes on other regions can justly
      be subtracted from what would otherwise be its claim on the value of using
      natural opportunities. Each region could then decide for itself whether to
      pass those costs on to individual couples who decide to conceive children.</p>
  <p>Similarly, when a region imposes costs on others through interregional pollution,
      the costs so imposed should be subtracted from the region's claim to the value
      of exclusive use of natural opportunities. The great challenge is to overcome
      the entrenched power that benefits from continued blindness to moral necessity.
      The mechanism must not be force of arms, for that entails too great a risk
      of installing a new power elite who would be as unprincipled as the first.
      Nor should the mechanism be the power of majorities, through legislation and
      referenda, for these processes can also be used for the selfish aggrandizement
      of those who control them. It is good that constitutions prohibit the taking
      of property without just compensation. It is to be hoped that courts will interpret
      such restricitons as prohibiting taxes that take all of the value of things
      currently regarded as property. </p>
  <p>When respect for a newly understood moral truth requires the dissappointment
      of previously protected expectations, those who would push their fellow citizens
      to incorporate that truth into the governmental process should be obliged to
      have their ideas reviewed in a constitutional amnedment process that will ensure
      that they will be adopted only if a broad consensus on them is achieved. When
      people are ready to see a new moral truth, that truth can overcome such a hurdle.

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">The Case for Site Value Rating</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In primitive societies, land is generally regarded as not ownable. No one
      made the land, so how can anyone own it? Ownership generally originates in
      conquest. In England, titles to land originated in the claim of William the
      Conqueror to own all the land because he was king. He granted to dukes, earls,
      etc. the right to collect rent from designated territories in exchange for
      their promises to fulfill various obligations to him. In the seventeenth century
      the nobility succeeded in removing all of their obligations to the crown, but
      they retained their rights to land. A substantial part of the great inequality
      in wealth in the United Kingdom can be traced to ancient patents of nobility
      that granted rights to collect rent.</p>
  <p>One highly visible consequence of allowing land rents to be privately appropriated
      is that young people find it nearly impossible to buy houses. The price
    of a "house," in the Southeast of Britain at least, is primarily the price
    of land. If the rent of land were collected publicly, the price of land would
      be inconsequential, and the price of a house would be the cost of the materials
      and labour that went into building it. It should be recognized that if
    the
      site value of land were taxed, the payment of such taxes would make it
    more expensive to live in large cities than in small towns, but young people
    would
      be better able to afford it because other taxes would be reduced, and the
    mortgages to which people would need to commit themselves would not be nearly
    as great.</p>
  <p>The justice of collecting the rent of land can be generalized to the justice
      of collecting a fee for any privilege that governments grant to some individuals
      and not others. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Georgist analysis strongly emphasises landownership as a principal source
      of inequality. Because land is a strictly limited resource, its private
      ownership necessarily excludes large sections of the community from its
      benefits. A landowning class thereby gains political economic power. In
      George&#8217;s own time the social identity and power of this landowning
      class was distinctive. Those who could not afford to buy land were forced
      to pay rent to the wealthier few who could. By taxing the value of land,
      George posited that publicly created wealth could be recouped from the
      private landowners and redistributed throughout the community more equitably
      in order to address social goals.</p>
  <p>Are George&#8217;s arguments about land ownership and wealth inequality
    relevant today? Australia provides an interesting example, because land is
    the single largest item in national wealth. Laurie Aarons outlines the concentration
    of farming land in particular in the hands of a few very wealthy corporations
    and individuals &#8211; what he refers to as &#8216;corporate squattocracy&#8217; (Aarons,
    1999: 23). The relentless increase in urban land values in recent years has
    also produced dramatic redistributions of wealth. In the State of New South
    Wales, for example, land values increased by about $361 billion over the
    period 1993 &#8211; 2003. The existing land-based taxes clawed back only
    $44 billion in government revenues, comprising only about 12% of the land-related
    economic surplus. So 88% was retained as &#8216;unearned income&#8217; by
    landowners (Stilwell and Jordan, forthcoming). A higher rate of land tax
    with fewer exemptions could have substantially reduced this private wealth
    appropriation. Thus is not necessarily to posit the desirability of recouping
    100% through land tax, because that would certainly raise major problems
    of people&#8217;s ability to pay, given that much of the increased wealth
    resulting from land price inflation has not been realised as current income.
    <strong>But it is indicative of the current imbalance between private and public
    appropriations of the surplus arising from increases in land-based wealth. </strong> </p>
  <p>However, it is also pertinent to note that land ownership today is significantly
    less concentrated than in George&#8217;s time, with around 70% of Australians
    being home-owners (including those in the process of purchasing their homes
    with mortgage finance). According to the recent Household, Income and Labour
    Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, home-ownership is unevenly distributed
    between income groups, with 56% of households in the lowest income quintile
    owning their own homes, compared to 85% of those in the highest quintile
    (Kohler et al, 2004: 10). But this distributional inequality is significantly
    less marked than the ownership of other assets, such as shares for example.
    Of course, most land ownership for residential purposes involves very small
    tracts, typically only about one-sixth of an acre in the suburban areas of
    the major cities. Flat-owners, growing annually as a proportion of the population,
    usually own less land and do so more indirectly through strata property titles.
    So the form of land tax (that is, whether flat rate or on a progressive scale,
    whether applying to all land or only that above a &#8216;threshold&#8217; value,
    or exempting owner-occupied property) becomes crucial to its effectiveness
    as a mechanism for tackling distributional inequality. It is also crucial
    to the political acceptability of land tax reform.</p>
  <p>In addition, it is apparent in modern economies that not all socioeconomic
    inequalities stem from the unequal capture of the economic surplus associated
    with land. Inequalities are also generated by unequal access to capital,
    educational and employment opportunities. These inequalities are imperfectly
    correlated with wealth deriving from land ownership. Hence, additional means
    of redress are needed, as J. K. Galbraith and other institutional economists
    have consistently argued (e.g. see Galbraith, 1992; 2002: chapter 3). For
    example, &#8216;floors,&#8217; such as minimum wage requirements and &#8216;social
    security&#8217; payments, must be provided to guarantee a minimum income
    to all members of society, including those excluded from the production process.
    A strong, albeit unfashionable, case can also be made for &#8216;ceilings&#8217; to
    limit excessive salaries, such as those of some top corporate executives,
    which far outweigh their productive contributions to society. The average
    executive remuneration levels in major Australian companies increased from
    22 times average weekly earnings to 74 times average weekly earnings in the
    period 1992-2002 (Shields et al, 2003: iii). It may be, as George argued,
    that &#8216;the increase of land values is always at the expense of the value
    of labour&#8217; (George, 1966: 224) but the complex distributions of income
    received by capital and labour are not readily explicable in terms of an
    analysis focusing exclusively on land. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most Europeans who settled North America hoped to leave feudal inequities
    behind. They envisioned a competitive meritocracy rather than a permanent
    aristocracy. Unfortunately, it was not to be. Slavery was the first anomaly;
    it took a civil war to end that. Then came the epic grabs of land and robber
    barons, neither of which we&#8217;ve undone.</p>
  <p>Fast-forward to my generation&#8217;s watch. If ever there was a time when
    a rising tide should have lifted all boats, this was it. After World War
    II, America went on an almost uninterrupted growth binge. Per capita economic
    output, adjusted for inflation, tripled between 1950 and the end of the century.
    The stock market rose about fortyfold. Mutual funds and tax-sheltered retirement
    accounts spread stock ownership to the masses. In the 1960s, the federal
    government launched an all-out War on Poverty. And yet, at the end of the
    century, the distribution of private wealth was more unequal than it had
    been in 1950. In cold numbers, the top 5 percent owned more than the bottom
    95 percent (see figure 2.3).</p>
  <p>Why did this happen? There are many explanations. One is that welfare kept
    the poor poor; this was argued by Charles Murray in his 1984 book Losing
    Ground.Welfare, he contended, encouraged single mothers to remain unmarried,
    increased the incidence of out-of-wedlock births, and created a parasitic
    underclass. In other words, Murray (and others) blamed victims or particular
    policies for perpetuating poverty, but paid scant attention to why poverty
    exists in the first place.</p>
  <p><strong>There are, of course, many roots, but my own hypothesis is this:
      much of what we label private wealth is taken from, or coproduced with,
      the commons.
    However, these takings from the commons are far from equal. To put it bluntly,
    the rich are rich because (through corporations) they get the lion&#8217;s
    share of common wealth; the poor are poor because they get very little.</strong></p>
  <p>Another way to say this is that, just as water flows downhill to the sea,
    so money flows uphill to property. Capitalism by its very design maximizes
    returns to existing wealth owners. It benefits, in particular, those who
    own stock when a successful company is young; they can receive hundreds,
    even thousands of times their initial investments when the company matures.
    Moreover, once such stockholders accumulate wealth, they can increase it
    through reinvestment, pass it on to their heirs, and use their inevitable
    influence over politicians to gain extra advantages &#8212; witness the steady
    lowering of taxes on capital gains, dividends, and inheritances. On top of
    this, in the last few decades, has been the phenomenon called <em>globalization</em>.
    The whole point of globalization is to increase the return to capital by
    enabling its owners to find the lowest costs on the planet. Hence the stagnation
    at the bottom alongside the surging wealth at the top.</p>
  <p>A critical piece of this analysis is that very few <em>new</em> shares of corporate
    stock are issued. As author Marjorie Kelly has pointed out, most established
    corporations finance growth through retained earnings and debt. They&#8217;re
    just as likely to buy back outstanding shares as to issue new ones. Consequently,
    old wealth is rarely diluted. When new money flows into the stock market,
    its main effect is to increase the wealth of existing stockholders and their
    fortunate heirs. Thus, of the total gain in marketable wealth that occurred
    in the United States between 1983 and 1998, more than half went to the top
    1 percent.</p>
  <p>The companies that do issue new stock are the young ones &#8212; the Microsofts,
    Apples, and Googles. Entertainers and athletes aside, most new multimillionaires
    are early stockholders in corporations like these. In these cases, however,
    the distribution of gains is so tilted in favor of these early stockholders
    that the skewed pattern of wealth distribution is replicated. New wealth
    joins old wealth, but the concentration remains the same. There&#8217;s no
    mechanism for dispensing wealth &#8212; even new wealth &#8212; more evenhandedly.

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 4: The Limits of Privatization (pages 49-63)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s tempting to believe that private owners, by pursuing their own
    self-interest, can preserve shared inheritances. No one likes being told
    what to do, and words like <em>statism</em> conjure fears of bureaucracy at best and
    tyranny at worst. By contrast, <em>privatism</em> connotes freedom.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we look at Garrett Hardin&#8217;s second alternative for
    saving the commons: privatism, or privatization. I argue that private corporations,
    operating in unconstrained markets, can allocate resources efficiently but
    can&#8217;t preserve them. The latter task requires setting aside some supplies
    for future generations &#8212; something neither markets nor corporations,
    when left to their own devices, will do. The reason lies in the algorithms
    and starting conditions of our current operating system.</p>
  <p>The Algorithms of Capitalism 2.0</p>
  <p>If you&#8217;ve ever used a computer spreadsheet, you know what an algorithm
    is. Each cell in the spreadsheet contains a set of instructions: take data
    from other cells, manipulate the data according to a formula, and display
    the result. The instructions within each cell are algorithms.</p>
  <p>If you think of the economy as a huge spreadsheet, with each cell representing
    a producer, consumer, or property owner, you can see that the behavior of
    the whole is driven by the algorithms in the cells. Our current operating
    system is dominated by three algorithms and one starting condition. The algorithms
    are:<br>
    (1) maximize return to capital,<br>
    <strong>(2) distribute property income on a per-share basis</strong>, and<br>
    (3) the price of nature equals zero.<br>
    <strong>The starting condition is that the top 5 percent of the people own more property
    shares than the remaining 95 percent.</strong></p>
  <p>The first algorithm is what drives corporations. It tells them to sell as
    much as they can, pay as little as possible for labor, resources, and waste
    disposal, and make shareholders happy every quarter. It focuses the minds
    of managers every day. If they work in marketing, they wake up thinking about
    how to sell more; if there&#8217;s no demand for their product, they must
    create some. If they work in finance, they worry about margins and leverage.
    If they&#8217;re in labor relations, they bargain hard, replace long-term
    employees with temps, and shift jobs to places where wages are lower. All
    the while, the CEO feeds sweet numbers to Wall Street.</p>
  <p>The second and third algorithms then mesh with the first. It&#8217;s the
    combination of these algorithms that causes the wheels of capitalism to devour
    nature and widen inequality among humans. At the same time, nothing in the
    algorithms requires or encourages corporations, either individually or collectively,
    to preserve anything.</p>
  <p>This doesn&#8217;t mean people inside corporations don&#8217;t think about
    protecting nature, raising their workers&#8217; pay, or giving something
    back to society. Often, they do. It does mean their room for actually doing
    such things is too narrow to make a difference. Nor does it mean that, from
    time to time, some brave mavericks don&#8217;t briefly flout the corporate
    algorithm. They do that, too. What I&#8217;m saying is that, in the great
    majority of cases, the corporate algorithm and its brethren are obeyed. For
    all practical purposes, the publicly traded corporation is a slave to its
    algorithm. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone knows what private wealth is, even if they don&#8217;t have much
    of it. It&#8217;s the property we inherit or accumulate individually, including
    fractional claims on corporations and mutual funds. In the United States
    in 2005, this private wealth (minus mortgages and other liabilities) totaled
    $48.5 trillion. As previously noted, the top 5 percent of Americans owns
    more of this treasure than the bottom 95 percent.</p>
  <p>But there&#8217;s another trove of wealth that&#8217;s not so well-known:
    our common wealth. Each of us is the joint recipient of a vast inheritance.
    This shared inheritance includes air and water, habitats and ecosystems,
    languages and cultures, science and technologies, social and political systems,
    and quite a bit more. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<p>Peter Barnes: <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">Capitalism
    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Universality is also what distinguishes the commons sector from the corporate
    sector. The starting condition for the corporate sector, as we&#8217;ve seen,
    is that the top 5 percent owns more shares than everyone else. The starting
    condition for the commons sector, by contrast, is one person, one share.</p>
  <p>The standard argument against third wave universal birthrights is that,
    while they might be nice in theory, in practice they are too expensive. They
    impose an unbearable burden on &#8220;the economy&#8221; &#8212; that is,
    on the winners in unfettered markets. Much better, therefore, to let everyone &#8212; including
    poor children and the sick &#8212; fend for themselves. In fact, the opposite
    is often true: universal birthrights, as we&#8217;ll see, can be cheaper
    and more efficient than individual acquisition. Moreover, they are always
    fairer.</p>
  <p>How far we might go down the path of extending universal birthrights is
    anyone&#8217;s guess, but we&#8217;re now at the point where, economically
    speaking, we can afford to go farther. Without great difficulty, we could
    add three birthrights to our economic operating system: one would pay everyone
    a regular dividend, the second would give every child a start-up stake, and
    the third would reduce and share medical costs. Whether we add these birthrights
    or not isn&#8217;t a matter of economic ability, but of attitude and politics.</p>
  <p>Why attitude? Americans suffer from a number of confusions. We think it&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221; to
    give people &#8220;something for nothing,&#8221; despite the fact that corporations
    take common wealth for nothing all the time. We believe the poor are poor
    and the rich are rich because they deserve to be, but don&#8217;t consider
    that millions of Americans work two or three jobs and still can&#8217;t make
    ends meet. Plus, we think tinkering with the &#8220;natural&#8221; distribution
    of income is &#8220;socialism,&#8221; or &#8220;big government,&#8221; or
    some other manifestation of evil, despite the fact that our current distribution
    of income isn&#8217;t &#8220;natural&#8221; at all, but rigged from the get-go
    by maldistributed property. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
