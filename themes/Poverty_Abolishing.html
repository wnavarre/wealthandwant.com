Poverty</span>  </div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p><strong>I'm willing to bet that most readers who come
        to this website have given up any hope that there is a way to abolish
        poverty. </strong>But there
            is, through understanding the structures that create it, and then
        correcting those structures. Your great-grandparents probably knew; these
        ideas were widely discussed 120
        years ago, and
        inspired thousands of people and many movements, though none were powerful
        enough
            to get them implemented, in the face of powerful special interests. </p>
      <p>Why should this century be any more amenable
          to the ideas? In part because of <a href="Technological_Progress.html">technological
          progress</a>, the very thing
          that, under our current structures has helped to create poverty! Because
          we can read about them for free, at the moment we want to, and discuss
          them freely with others who are also interested, and share them readily
          with
          people
          we
          know
          to
          be seriously
          concerned
          about the common good. We can share ideas and build a new consensus &#8212; perhaps
          the best analogy is to the movement to abolish chattel slavery in the 19th
          century (and that analogy is closer than might be obvious to those who
          are newly acquainted with these ideas) &#8212; that if America is to
          live up to its principles and its self-evident truths, we must implement
          George's
          remedy. </p>
      <p>Not only will poverty be abolished, but also some of our other
            pressing problems, including housing affordability and urban sprawl,
        with all its ills for our lives, for the environment and for world peace.
        And we could once again be worthy of serving as a beacon of genuine freedom
        to those
        in
        other
        countries, by example. No words needed! </p>
      <p>I am heartened by the first two paragraphs from the prologue to  David
        Brion Davis's <em>Inhuman
          Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World:</em> </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">In 1770, on the eve of the American Revolution, African
            American slavery was legal and almost unquestioned throughout the
            New World. The ghastly slave trade from Africa was still expanding
            and for many decades had been shipping five Africans across the Atlantic
            for every European immigrant to the Americas. An imaginary &quot;hemispheric
            traveler&quot; would have seen black slaves in every colony from
            Canada and New England all the way south to Spanish Peru and Chile.
            In the incomparably rich colonies in the Caribbean, they often constituted
            population majorities of 90 percent or more. But in 1888, one hundred
            and eighteen years later, when Brazil finally freed all its slaves,
            the institution had been outlawed throughout the Western Hemisphere.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">This final act of liberation, building on Abraham
            Lincoln's emancipation achievement in the American Civil War, took
            place only a century after the creation of the first antislavery
            societies in human history &#8212; initially small groups in such
            places as Philadelphia, London, Manchester, and New York.<em> <strong>The
            abolition of New World slavery depended in large measure on a major
            transformation in moral perception &#8212; on the emergence of writers,
            speakers, and reformers, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century,
            who were willing to condemn an institution that had been sanctioned
            for thousands of years and who also strove to make human society
            something more than an endless contest of greed and power.</strong></em> [emphasis
            mine]</font></p>

    <p>H.G. Brown: <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">Significant
                Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
                14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part

  </div>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our
              inquiry is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the
              growth and decay of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated
              recognitions of relation and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions.
              Thus are given to our conclusions the greatest certitude and highest
              sanction.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils
              arising from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are
              becoming more and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not
              incidents of progress, but tendencies which must bring progress to a
              halt; that they will not cure themselves, but, on the contrary, must,
              unless their cause is removed, grow greater and greater, until they sweep
              us back into barbarism by the road every previous civilization has trod.
              But it also shows that these evils are not imposed by natural laws; that
              they spring solely from social maladjustments which ignore natural laws,
              and that in removing their cause we shall be giving an enormous impetus
              to progress.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance
        pinches and embrutes men, and all the manifold evils which flow from
        it, spring from a denial of
              justice. In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities
        which nature freely offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law
        of justice &#8212; for,
              so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice
              seems to be the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away
        this injustice and asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities,
              we shall conform ourselves to the law &#8212; </p>

    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all
        that is politically, socially, or morally desirable. It has the qualities
        of a true reform, for it will
              make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out
        in letter and spirit of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
              that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That
              all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator
              with
              certain
              inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the
              pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>These rights are denied when the equal right
        to land &#8212; on which
              and by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of
              political rights will not compensate for the denial of the equal
              right to the
              bounty of nature. Political liberty, when the equal right to land
              is denied,
              becomes, as population increases and invention goes on, merely
              the liberty to compete for employment at starvation wages. This
              is the
              truth that
              we have ignored. And so</p>

              grow her
      demands. She will have no half service!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not
        to vex the ear in empty boastings. For Liberty means Justice, and Justice
        is the natural law &#8212; the

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished
        her mission when she has abolished hereditary privileges and given men
        the ballot, who think
                of her as having no further relations to the everyday affairs
        of life, have not seen her real grandeur &#8212; to them the poets who
        have sung of her must seem rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the
        sun is
        the
                lord of life, as well as of light; as his beams not merely pierce
        the clouds, but support all growth, supply all motion, and call forth
        from what would otherwise be a cold and inert mass all the infinite
        diversities
                of being and beauty, so is liberty to mankind. It is not for
        an abstraction that men have toiled and died; that in every age the witnesses

    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge,

              But, of all these, Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary condition.

    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that,
              producing inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin
              to lower. Liberty calls to us again. We must follow her further; we must
              trust her fully. Either we must wholly accept her or she will not stay.
              <strong>It is not enough that men should vote; it is not enough that
              they should be theoretically equal before the law. They must have liberty
              to avail
              themselves of the opportunities and means of life; they must stand on
              equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature. Either this, or Liberty
              withdraws her light!</strong> Either this, or darkness comes on, and the very
              forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that work destruction.
              This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries. Unless

            their weary toil; that is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery
            in place of that which has been destroyed; that is bringing political

                the individual. The neglect of these simple principles has brought
                upon us the curse of widespread poverty and all the evils that flow
                from it. Their recognition will abolish poverty, will secure to the

                foundation on which all other reforms may be based. To secure the

                    George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp; (1887
          speech) </p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We are told, in the first place,
                by the newspapers, that you cannot abolish poverty because there is not
                wealth enough to go around. We are told that if all the wealth of the
                United States were divided up there would only be some eight hundred
                dollars apiece. Well, if that is the case, all the more monstrous is
                the injustice which today gives some people millions and tens of
                millions, and even hundreds of millions. If there really is so little,
                then the more injustice in these great fortunes.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>But we do not propose to abolish poverty by dividing up wealth.
                We propose to abolish poverty by setting at work that vast army of men
&#8212; estimated last year to amount in this country alone to one million &#8212;
            that vast army of men only anxious to create wealth, but who are now,
                by a system which permits dogs-in-the-manger to monopolize God&#8217;s
            bounty, deprived of the opportunity to toil.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Then, again, they tell us you cannot abolish poverty, because
                poverty always has existed. Well, if poverty always has existed, all
                the more need for our moving for its abolition. It has existed long
                enough. We ought to be tired of it; let us get rid of it. But I deny
                that poverty, such poverty as we see on earth today, always has
            existed. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
            <br>
            <small>We propose to abolish poverty, to tear it up by the roots, to
                open free and abundant employment for every person. We propose to
                disturb no just right of property. We are defenders and upholders of
                the sacred right of property &#8212; that right of property which justly
                attaches to everything that is produced by labor; that right which
                gives to all people a just right of property in what they have produced
&#8212; that makes it theirs to give, to sell, to bequeath, to do whatever
                they please with, as long as in using it they do not injure any one
                else. That right of property we insist upon; that, we would uphold
            against all the world.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>To a house, a coat, a book &#8212; anything produced by labor &#8212; there
                is a clear individual title, which goes back to the person who made it.
                That is the foundation of the just, the sacred right of property. It
                rests on the right of people to the use of their own powers, on their
                right to profit by the exertion of their own labor; but who can carry
            the right of property in land that far?</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Who can claim a title of absolute ownership in land? Until one
                who claims the exclusive ownership of a piece of this planet can show a
                title originating with the Maker of this planet; until that one can
                produce a decree from the Creator declaring that this city lot, or that
                great tract of agricultural or coal land, or that gas well, was made
                for that one person alone &#8212; until then we have a right to hold that the
            land was intended for all of us.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Natural religion and revealed religion alike tell us that God is
                no respecter of persons; that He did not make this planet for a few
                individuals; that He did not give it to one generation in preference to
                other generations, but that He made it for the use during their lives
                of all the people that His providence brings into the world. If this be
                true, the child that is born tonight in the humblest tenement in the
                most squalid quarter of New York, comes into life seized with as good a
                title to the land of this city as any Astor or Rhinelander. ...&nbsp;<a

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">            </span> LABOR may be likened to a man who as he carries home his
            earnings is waylaid by a series of robbers. One demands this much,
            and another that much, but last of all stands one who demands all
            that is left, save just enough to enable the victim to maintain life
            and come forth next day to work. So long as this last robber remains,
            what will it benefit such a man to drive off any or all of the other
            robbers? <br>
    <br>
Such is the situation of labor today throughout the civilized world. And the
robber that takes all that is left, is private property in land. Improvement,
no matter how great, and reform, no matter how beneficial in itself, cannot help
that class who, deprived of all right to the use of the material elements, have
only the power to labor &#8212; a power as useless in itself as a sail without
wind, a pump without water, or a saddle without a horse. &#8212; <em>Protection

THERE is but one way to remove an evil &#8212; and that is, to remove its cause.
Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>while
productive power grows, because land, which is the source of all wealth and the
field of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate poverty, to make wages what
justice commands they should be, the full earnings of the laborer, we must therefore
substitute for the individual ownership of land a common ownership. Nothing else
will go to the cause of the evil &#8212; in nothing else is there the slightest
hope. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp062.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp062.html"> &#8212; Book
VI, Chapter 2, The Remedy: The True Remedy</a></p>
            <p>BUT is there not some line the recognition of which will enable
              us to say with something like scientific precision that this man
              is rich and that man is poor; some line of possession which will
              enable us truly to distinguish between rich and poor in all places
              and conditions of society; a line of the natural mean or normal
              possession, below which in varying degrees is poverty, and above
              which in varying degrees is wealthiness? It seems to me that there
              must be. And if we stop to think of it, we may see that there is.
              If we set aside for the moment the narrower economic meaning of
              service, by which direct service is conveniently distinguished
              from the indirect service embodied in wealth, we may resolve all
              the things which directly or indirectly satisfy human desire into
              one term service, just as we resolve fractions into a common denominator.
              Now is there not a natural or normal line of the possession or
              enjoyment of service? Clearly there is. It is that of equality
              between giving and receiving. This is the equilibrium which Confucius
              expressed in the golden word of his teaching that in English we
              translate into "reciprocity."&nbsp; Naturally the services which
              a member of a human society is entitled to receive from other members
              are the equivalents of those he renders to others. Here is the
              normal line from which what we call wealthiness and what we call
              poverty take their start. He who can command more service than
              he need render, is rich. He is poor, who can command less service
              than he does render or is willing to render: for in our civilization
              of today we must take note of the monstrous fact that men willing
              to work cannot always find opportunity to work. The one has more
              than he ought to have; the other has less. Rich and poor are thus
              correlatives of each other; the existence of a class of rich involves
              the existence of a class of poor, and the reverse; and abnormal
              luxury on the one side and abnormal want on the other have a relation
              of necessary sequence. To put this relation into terms of morals,
              the rich are the robbers, since they are at least sharers in the
              proceeds of robbery; and the poor are the robbed. This is the reason,
              I take it, why Christ, Who was not really a man of such reckless
              speech as some Christians deem Him to have been, always expressed
              sympathy with the poor and repugnance of the rich. In His philosophy
              it was better even to be robbed than to rob. In the kingdom of
              right doing which He preached, rich and poor would be impossible,
              because rich and poor in the true sense are the results of wrong-doing.
              And when He said, "It is easier for a camel to pass through the
              eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven," He
              simply put in the emphatic form of Eastern metaphor a statement
              of fact as coldly true as the statement that two parallel lines
              can never meet. <strong>Injustice cannot live where justice rules,
              and even if the man himself might get through, his riches &#8212; his
              power of compelling service without rendering service &#8212; must
              of necessity be left behind. If there can be no poor in the kingdom
              of heaven, clearly there can be no rich. And so it is utterly impossible
              in this, or in any other conceivable world, to abolish unjust poverty,
              without at the same time abolishing unjust possessions. </strong>This is
              a hard word to the softly amiable philanthropists, who, to speak
              metaphorically, would like to get on the good side of God without
              angering the devil. But it is a true word nevertheless. &#8212; <em>The

              as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge

              to each the perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal
              liberty of every other, must civilization advance. Just as they
              fail in this, must advancing civilization come to a halt and recede.

            <p>THE poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes
              men, and all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from
              a denial of justice. In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities

              law of justice &#8212; for, so far as we can see, when we view
              things upon a large scale, justice seems to be the supreme law
              of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and asserting
              the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform

            <p>In &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; after reaching his conclusion
              that command of the land which is necessary for labor is command
              of all the fruits of labor save enough to enable labor to exist,
              Henry George says:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>So simple and so clear is this truth that to fully see it once
                is always to recognize it. There are pictures which, though looked
                at again and again, present only a confused labyrinth of lines
                or scroll-work &#8212; a landscape, trees, or something of the
                kind &#8212; until once attention is called to the fact that
                these things make up a face or a figure. This relation once recognized
                is always afterward clear. 111 It is so in this case. In the
                light of this truth all social facts group themselves in an orderly
                relation, and the most diverse phenomena are seen to spring from
                one great principle.</p>
              <p> <font size="-1">111. This idea of the concealed picture was
                  graphically illustrated with a story by Congressman James G.
                  Maguire, at that time a Judge of the Superior Court of San
                  Francisco, in a speech at the Academy of Music, New York City,
                  in 1887. In substance he said:</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">&quot;I was one day walking along Kearney Street
                  in San Francisco, when I noticed a crowd around the show window
                  of a store, looking at something inside. I took a glance myself
                  and saw only a very poor picture of a very uninteresting landscape.
                  But as I was turning away my eye caught the words underneath
                  the picture, 'Do you see the cat?' I looked again and more
                  closely, but saw no cat in the picture. Then I spoke to the
                  crowd.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Gentlemen,' I said, 'I see no cat in
                  that picture. Is there a cat there?'</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Some one in the crowd replied:</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Naw, there ain't no cat there. Here's
                  a crank who says he sees the cat, but nobody else can see it.'</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Then the crank spoke up:</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">'I tell you there is a cat there, too. It's
                  all cat. What you fellows take for a landscape is just nothing
                  more than the outlines of a cat. And you needn't call a man
                  a crank either, because he can see more with his eyes than
                  you can.'</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well,&quot; the judge continued, &quot;I
                  looked very closely at the picture, and then I said to the
                  man they called a crank:</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Really, sir, I cannot make out a cat.
                  I can see nothing but a poor picture of a landscape.'</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Why, judge,' he exclaimed, 'just look
                  at that bird in the air. That's the cat's ear.'</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">I looked, but was obliged to say:</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">'I am sorry to be so stupid, but I can't make
                  a cat's ear of that bird. It is a poor bird, but not a cat's
                  ear.'</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Well, then,' the crank urged, 'look at
                  that twig twirled around in a circle. That's the cat's eye.'</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">But I couldn't make an eye of it.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">'Oh, then,' said the crank a little impatiently,
                  'look at those sprouts at the foot of the tree, and the grass.
                  They make the cat's claws.'</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">&quot;After another deliberate examination,
                  I reported that they did look a little like a claw, but I couldn't
                  connect them with a cat.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">&quot;Once more the crank came back at me. 'Don't
                  you see that limb off there? and that other limb under it?
                  and that white space between? Well, that white space is the
                  cat's tail.'</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">&quot;I looked again and was just on the point
                  of replying that there was no cat there so far as I could see,
                  when suddenly the whole cat burst upon me. There it was, sure
                  enough, just as the crank had said; and the only reason that
                  the rest of us couldn't see it was that we hadn't got the right
                  point of view. But now that I saw it I could see nothing else
                  in the picture. The landscape had disappeared and a cat had
                  taken its place. And, do you know, I was never afterward able,
                  upon looking at that picture, to see anything in it but the

            <p>Many events subsequent to his writing have gone to prove that
              Henry George was right. Each new phase of the social problem makes
              it still more clear that the disorderly development of our civilization
              is explained, not by pressure of population, nor by the superficial
              relations of employers and employed, nor by scarcity of money,
              nor by the drinking habits of the poor, nor by individual differences
              in ability to produce wealth, nor by an incompetent or malevolent
              Creator, but, as he has said, by &quot;inequality in the ownership
              of land.&quot; And each new phase makes it equally clear that the
              remedy for poverty is not to be found in famine and disease and
              war, nor in strikes which are akin to war, nor in the suppression
              of strikes by force of arms, nor in the coinage of money, nor in
              prohibition or high license, nor in technical education, nor in
              anything else short of approximate equality in the ownership of
              land. This alone secures equal opportunities to produce, and full
              ownership by each producer of his own product. This is justice,
              this is order. And unless our civilization have it for a foundation,
              new forms of slavery will assuredly lead us into new forms of barbarism.112</p>

                  his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress
                  goes on. This is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not

                  the fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting a harder
                  and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been destroyed;

          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Georgist main agenda, as
                earlier noted, is economic justice.
                If one searches the term &#8220;economic justice&#8221; online, the first site that
                will appear is the Georgist website, <a href="http://www.progress.org/">progress.org</a>.
                The starting point
                is that people are entitled to what they earn, but only to what they
                earn.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">50</span></small>
            The fruits of the commons generated in rent might also be distributed
                to citizens equally if not used to finance the general services of
                government. In practice this means the abolition of those taxes that
                represent an unjust capture of one&#8217;s personal property &#8212; taxes such as
                income, sales, and other nuisance taxes. It accepts, to be sure, the
                need to collect user fees, Pigouvian taxes, and perhaps sumptuary (sin)
                taxes. It argues aggressively for the collection of economic rent in
                support of government and, for any remaining surplus, its distribution
                as a citizens&#8217; dividend.&nbsp; The justification for the collection of
          rent has several grounds: </small></div>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>the first is to preclude the entitlement of
              windfall gains to those who have unfairly captured monopoly control of
              parts of what are rightfully the public commons. 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>A second reason is to
              enhance the efficiency of economic productivity which the failure to
              collect rent prevents. It is not just that monopoly control of commons
              sites drives less attractive and less valuable land into production
              because the primary choices are unavailable; it is also that the use of
              alternative taxes leads to a deadweight loss in the economy which
              reduces the wealth of every citizen except the monopoly titleholder.The
              proper collection of land rent leads to increases in economic
              efficiency in a way that wages are not artificially depressed and more
            opportunities arise in the labor market.</small></li>

      for the poor, especially they who are on the backs of the poor; they will
      do anything
                  that is not fundamental. Nobody ever dreams of giving the poor
      a chance to help themselves. The reformers in this state have passed
                  a law prohibiting women from working more than eight hours
      in one day in certain industries &#8212; so much do women love to work
      that they must be stopped by law. If any benevolent heathen see fit to
                  come here and do work, we send them to gaol or send them back
      where they came from.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">All these prohibitory laws are froth. You can only cure effects
                by curing the cause. Every sin and every wrong that exists in the
                world is the product of law, and you cannot cure it without curing
                the cause. Lawyers, as a class, are very stupid. What would you think
                of a doctor, who, finding a case of malaria, instead of draining
                the swamp, would send the patient to gaol, and leave the swamp where
                it is? We are seeking to improve conditions of life by improving

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">No man created the earth, but to a large extent
      all take from the earth a portion of it and mould it into useful things
      for the use
                of man. Without land man cannot live; without access to it man
      cannot labor. First of all, he must have the earth, and this he cannot
      have
                access to until the single tax is applied. It has been proven
      by the history of the human race that the single tax does work, and
                that it will work as its advocates claim. For instance, man turned
                from Europe, filled with a population of the poor, and discovered
                the great continent of America. Here, when he could not get profitable
                employment, he went on the free land and worked for himself,
      and in those early days there were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully
                rich and no extremely poor &#8212; because there was cheap land.
                Men could go to work for themselves, and thus take the surplus off
                the labor market. There were no beggars in the early days. It was
                only when the landlord got in his work &#8212; when the earth monopoly
                was complete &#8212; that the great mass of men had to look to
                a boss for a job.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">All the remedial laws on earth can scarcely
      help the poor when the earth is monopolized. Men must live from the earth,
      they must till
                the soil, dig the coal and iron and cut down the forest. Wise
      men know it, and cunning men know it, and so a few have reached out their
                hands and grasped the earth; and they say, &quot;These mines of coal
                and iron, which it took nature ages and ages to store, belong to
                me; and no man can touch them until he sees fit to pay the tribute

        the pleasure of making her acquaintance, because she lives in a lunatic
        asylum, which does not happen
                to be on my visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent
        from birth. She is well taken care of, because her father left her when
        he
                died the income of a large farm on the outskirts of a city. The
        city has since grown and the land is now worth, at conservative estimate,
                about twenty million dollars. It is covered with office buildings,
        and
                the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent by the
        woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good health,
        so she
                may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
              this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million
              dollars. And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation,
              which would he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society
              which compels thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order
              to pay her the income of twenty million dollars?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it
        easy to see that she is not entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns.
              But how about all the other people who have bought up and are holding
              for speculation the most desirable land? The value of this land increases,
              not because of anything these owners do &#8212; not because of any useful
              service they render to the community &#8212; but purely because
              the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood and
              must
              have use of the
              land.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
              because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way.
              But it seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community
              was going to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not
              in any way useful to the community. The man may have planted trees, or
              built roads, and put in sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work,
              and for that he should be paid. But should he be paid for guessing what
              the rest of us were going to need?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences
        of this guessing game. The consequences of land speculation are tenantry
        and debt on the farms,
              and slums and luxury in the cities. A great part of the necessary
        land is held out of use, and so the value of all land continually increases,
              until the poor man can no longer own a home. The value of farm
        land also
              increases; so year by year more independent farmers are dispossessed,
              because they cannot pay interest on their mortgages. So the land
        becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where wealth
              accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with
              festering slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided
              with enormous
              fortunes, which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot
              intelligently spend. ... </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy
              families, living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums. Here
              and there among these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned
              what he is consuming, and that it has not brought him happiness, and
              is bringing still less to his children. Such men are casting about for

              Some of them might be grateful to learn about this enclave plan, and
              to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what its people are doing

      * poor housing which stultified home life and suppressed initiative;<br>
      * fragile family relationships which distorted personality development.</div>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The logic of this approach suggested that each of these causes be attacked
        one by one. Hence a housing program to transform living conditions, improved
        educational facilities to furnish tools for better job opportunities, and family
        counseling to create better personal adjustments were designed. In combination
        these measures were intended to remove the causes of poverty.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">While none of these remedies in itself is unsound, all have a fatal disadvantage.
      ... </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>We are likely to find that the problems of housing and education, instead
        of preceding the elimination of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty
        is first abolished. ...</p>

    <div style="text-align: left;">Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income
      operates as a consistently progressive measure.</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;"> First, it must be pegged to the median
        income of society, not the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income
        at the floor would simply perpetuate
              welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions.</div>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">  Second, the guaranteed income must be
        dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total social income grows.
        Were it permitted to remain
            static under
                    growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative
            decline. If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income
            has risen, then the guaranteed
                    income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage.
            Without these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying
            the gains of security
                    and stability.  </div>

    <div style="text-align: left;">This proposal is not a &quot;civil rights&quot; program,
        in the sense that that term is currently used. The program would benefit
        all the poor, including
        the two-thirds of them who are white. I hope that both Negro and white
        will act in coalition to effect this change, because their combined strength
        will
      be necessary to overcome the fierce opposition we must realistically anticipate.</div>

      <p>Our nation's adjustment to a new mode of thinking will be facilitated if we
          realize that for nearly forty years two groups in our society have already
          been enjoying a guaranteed income. Indeed, it is a symptom of our confused
          social values that these two groups turn out to be the richest and the poorest.
          The wealthy who own securities have always had an assured income; and their
          polar opposite, the relief client, has been guaranteed an income, however miniscule,
        through welfare benefits.</p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">John Kenneth Galbraith has estimated that
        $20 billion a year would effect a guaranteed income, which he describes
        as &quot;not much more than we will
        spend the next fiscal year to rescue freedom and democracy and religious
      liberty as these are defined by 'experts' in Vietnam.&quot;</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The contemporary tendency in our society is to base our distribution on scarcity,
          which has vanished, and to compress our abundance into the overfed mouths of
          the middle and upper classes until they gag with superfluity. If democracy
          is to have breadth of meaning, it is necessary to adjust this inequity. It
          is not only moral, but it is also intelligent. We are wasting and degrading
        human life by clinging to archaic thinking. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">The curse of poverty has no justification in our age. It is socially as cruel
        and blind as the practice of cannibalism at the dawn of civilization, when
        men ate each other because they had not yet learned to take food from the soil
        or to consume the abundant animal life around them. The time has come for us
        to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty.
