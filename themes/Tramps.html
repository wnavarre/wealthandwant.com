  <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tramps</span></div>
  <p>The tramp was a well-known phenomenon in America, at least into the 1940s;
    my grandparents, who were farmers in Lancaster County, PA, apparently earned
    good ratings
    from the tramps, who would leave discreet coded chalk markings 
    to tell
    those who followed where they would be met with kindness or hostility.
    My grandfather would let them sleep in his barn, after asking them for their
    matches, which
    he would return in the morning. </p>
  <p>Charlie Chaplin gave us the character of &quot;The Little Tramp.&quot; Today,
    perhaps our homeless brethren are the closest analogy today, people whose
    earning ability is insufficient to allow them to meet the costs of the necessities
    of life. </p>
  <p>Is it something they are doing wrong, or is it a maladjustment of our society?</p>

<p>  Henry George:&nbsp; <a
 href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
 Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is "the home of freedom,"
and "the asylum of the oppressed;"
our population is yet sparse, our public domain yet wide; we are the
greatest of food producers, yet even here there are beggars, tramps,
paupers, men torn by anxiety for the support of their families, women
who know not which way to turn, little children growing up in such
poverty and squalor that only a miracle can keep them pure. "Always
with you," even here. What is the week or the day of the week that
our papers do not tell of man or woman who, to escape the tortures of
want, has stepped out of life unbidden? What is this but famine? <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But does not the same relation exist between English pauperism
and
English landlordism &#8211; between American tramps and the American
land system? Essentially the same land system as that of Ireland
exists elsewhere, and, wherever it exists, distress of essentially
the same kind is to be seen. And elsewhere, just as certainly as in
Ireland, is the connection between the two that of cause and
effect.<strong> ... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>But it is needless to compare sufferings and measure miseries. I
merely wish to correct that impression which leads so many people to
talk and write as though rent and land tenures related solely to
agriculture and to agricultural communities. Nothing could be more
erroneous. Land is necessary to all production, no matter what be the
kind or form; land is the standing-place, the workshop, the
storehouse of labor; it is to the human being the only means by which
he can obtain access to the material universe or utilize its powers.
Without land man cannot exist. To whom the ownership of land is
given, to him is given the virtual ownership of the men who must live
upon it. When this necessity is absolute, then does he necessarily
become their absolute master. And just as this point is
neared &#8211; that is to say, just as competition increases the demand
for land &#8211; just in that degree does the power of taking a larger
and larger share of the earnings of labor increase. It is this power
that gives land its value; this is the power that enables the owner
of valuable land to reap where he has not sown &#8211; to appropriate to
himself wealth which he has had no share in producing. Rent is always
the devourer of wages. The owner of city land takes, in the rents he
receives for his land, the earnings of labor just as clearly as does
the owner of farming land. And whether he be working in a garret ten
stories above the street, or in a mining drift thousands of feet
below the earth's surface, it is the competition for the use of land
that ultimately determines what proportion of the produce of his
labor the laborer will get for himself. This is the reason why modern
progress does not tend to extirpate poverty; this is the reason why,
with all the inventions and improvements and economies which so
enormously increase productive power, wages everywhere tend to the
minimum of a bare living. The cause that in Ireland produces poverty
and distress &#8211; the ownership by some of the people of the land on
which and from which the whole people must live &#8211; everywhere else
produces the same results. It is this that produces the hideous
squalor of London and Glasgow slums; it is this that makes want
jostle luxury in the streets of rich New York, that forces little
children to monotonous and stunting toil in Massachusetts mills, and
that fills the highways of our newest States with tramps.<strong> ... </strong></small><small><a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our Napoleon of Wall Street, our
rising Charlemagne of railroads,
who came to this city with nothing but a new kind of mouse-trap in a
mahogany box, but who now, though yet in the vigor of his prime,

all, is interviewed by a reporter just as he is about to step aboard
his palace-car for a grand combination expedition into the Southwest.
He descants upon the services he is rendering in welding into one big
machine a lot of smaller machines, in uniting into one vast railroad
empire the separated railroad kingdoms. He likewise descants upon the
great prosperity of the whole country. Everybody is prosperous and
contented, he says: there is, of course, a good deal of misery in the
big cities, but, then, there always is!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet not alone in the great cities.
I ride on the Hudson River
Railroad on a bitter cold day, and from one of the pretty towns with
Dutch names gets in a constable with a prisoner, whom he is to take
to the Albany penitentiary. In this case justice has been swift
enough, for the crime, the taking of a shovel, has been committed
only a few hours before. Such coat as the man has he keeps buttoned
up, even in the hot car, for, the constable says, he has no
underclothes at all. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He stole the
shovel to get to the penitentiary,
where it is warm. The constable says they have lots of such cases,
and that even in these good times these pretty country towns are
infested with such tramps. With all our vast organizing, our
developing of productive powers and cheapening of transportation, we
are yet creating a class of utter pariahs.</span> And they are to be
found
not merely in the great cities, but wherever the locomotive runs. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IN the effects upon the
distribution of wealth, of making land
private property, we may thus see an explanation of that paradox
presented by modern progress. The perplexing phenomena of deepening
want with increasing wealth, of labor rendered more dependent and
helpless by the very introduction of labor-saving machinery, are the
inevitable result of natural laws as fixed and certain as the law of
gravitation. Private property in land is the primary cause of the
monstrous inequalities which are developing in modern society. It is
this, and not any miscalculation of Nature in bringing into the world
more mouths than she can feed, that gives rise to that tendency of
wages to a minimum &#8211; that "iron law of wages," as the Germans call
it-that, in spite of all advances in productive power, compels the
laboring-classes to the least return on which they will consent to
live. It is this that produces all those phenomena that are so often
attributed to the conflict of labor and capital. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It is this that
condemns Irish peasants to rags and hunger, that produces the
pauperism of England and the tramps of America. I</span>t is this that
makes
the almshouse and the penitentiary the marks of what we call high
civilization; that in the midst of schools and churches degrades and
brutalizes men, crushes the sweetness out of womanhood and the joy
out of childhood. It is this that makes lives that might be a
blessing a pain and a curse, and every year drives more and more to
seek unbidden refuge in the gates of death. For, a permanent tendency
to inequality once set up, all the forces of progress tend to greater
and greater inequality. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet not alone in the great cities.
I ride on the Hudson River
Railroad on a bitter cold day, and from one of the pretty towns with

are yet creating a class of utter pariahs. And they are to be found
not merely in the great cities, but wherever the locomotive runs.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have here abolished all
hereditary privileges and legal
distinctions of class. Monarchy, aristocracy, prelacy, we have swept
them all away. We have carried mere political democracy to its
ultimate. Every child born in the United States may aspire to be
President. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Every man, even though he
be a tramp or a pauper, has a
vote, and one man's vote counts for as much as any other man's vote.</span>
Before the law all citizens are absolutely equal. In the name of the
people all laws run. They are the source of all power, the fountain
of all honor. In their name and by their will all government is
carried on; the highest officials are but their servants.
Primogeniture and entail we have abolished wherever they existed. We
have and have had free trade in land. We started with something
infinitely better than any scheme of peasant proprietorship which it
is possible to carry into effect in Great Britain. We have had for
our public domain the best part of an immense continent. We have had
the preemption law and the homestead law. It has been our boast that
here every one who wished it could have a farm. We have had full
liberty of speech and of the press. We have not merely common
schools, but high schools and universities, open to all who may
choose to attend. Yet here the same social difficulties apparent on
the other side of the Atlantic are beginning to appear. It is already
clear that our democracy is a vain pretense, our make-believe of
equality a sham and a fraud.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not a republic of landlords and
peasants; not a republic of
millionaires and tramps; not a republic in which some are masters and
some serve. But a republic of equal citizens, where competition
becomes cooperation, and the interdependence of all gives true
independence to each; where moral progress goes hand in hand with
intellectual progress, and material progress elevates and
enfranchises even the poorest and weakest and lowliest.&nbsp;

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the aggregation
  of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations, necessarily implies the loss
  by the people of governmental control. Democratic forms may be maintained,
  but there can be as much tyranny and misgovernment under democratic forms as
  any other &#8212; in fact, they lend themselves most readily to tyranny and
  misgovernment. Forms count for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and
  continued to abhor
  the very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators, that
  at first meant no more than our &quot;Boss,&quot; they crouched before tyrants
  more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of &quot;bosses,&quot; developed
  political C&aelig;sars in municipalities and states. If this development continues,
  in time there will come a national boss. We are young but we are growing. The
  day may arrive when the &quot;Boss of America&quot; will be to the modern world
  what C&aelig;sar was to the Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic
  government in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
  something like equality &#8212; where the great mass of citizens are personally
  free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor made subject by
  their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in a property qualification.
  The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man. To give
  the suffrage to slaves is only to give votes to their owners. That universal
  suffrage may add to, instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we
  see when mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
  without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to
  vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.
  How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a square inch
  of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and, urged by starvation, must
  bid against his fellows for the privilege of using them? <strong>When it comes to voting
  tramps, some principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
  I have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse
  to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government. </strong><a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

  (1889 speech)<br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Mr Abner Thomas, of New York, a
strict orthodox Presbyterian
&#8212; and the son of Rev Dr Thomas, author of a commentary on the
bible &#8212;wrote a little while ago an allegory. Dozing off in his
chair, he dreamt that he was ferried over the River of Death, and,
taking the straight and narrow way, came at last within sight of the
Golden City. A fine-looking old gentleman angel opened the wicket,
inquired his name, and let him in; warning him, at the same time,
that it would be better if he chose his company in heaven, and did
not associate with disreputable angels. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What!&#8221; said the newcomer, in
astonishment: &#8220;Is
not this heaven?&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;But
there are a lot of
tramp angels here now." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;How can that be?&#8221; asked Mr
Thomas. &#8220;I thought
everybody had plenty in heaven.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;It used to be that way some time
ago,&#8221; said the
warden: &#8220;And if you wanted to get your harp polished or your
wings combed, you had to do it yourself. But matters have changed
since we adopted the same kind of property regulations in heaven as
you have in civilised countries on earth, and we find it a great
improvement, at least for the better class.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the warden told the newcomer
that he had better decide
where he was going to board.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to board anywhere,&#8221;
said Thomas:
&#8220;I would much rather go over to that beautiful green knoll and
lie down.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I would not advise you to do
so,&#8221; said the warden:
&#8220;The angel who owns that knoll does not like to encourage
trespassing. Some centuries ago, as I told you, we introduced the
system of private property into the soil of heaven. So we divided the
land up. It is all private property now.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I hope I was considered in that
division?&#8221; said
Thomas. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;No,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;You were
not; but if you
go to work, and are saving, you can easily earn enough in a couple of
centuries to buy yourself a nice piece. You get a pair of wings free
as you come in, and you will have no difficulty in hypothecating them
for a few days board until you find work. But I should advise you to
be quick about it, as our population is constantly increasing, and
there is a great surplus of labour. Tramp angels are, in fact,
becoming quite a nuisance.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What shall I go to work at?&#8221;
asked Thomas. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Our principal industries are the
making of harps and
crowns and the growing of flowers,&#8221; responded the warden:
&#8220;But there any many opportunities for employment in personal
service.&#8221;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I love flowers,&#8221; said Thomas. &#8220;I
will go to work
growing them, There is a beautiful piece of land over there that
nobody seems to be using. I will go to work on that.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said the
warden. &#8220;That
property belongs to one of our most far-sighted angels who has got
very rich by the advance of land values, and who is holding that
piece for a rise. You will have to buy it or rent it before you can
work on it, and you can&#8217;t do that yet.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The story goes on to describe how
the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven?&nbsp; ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

  <p>That much of our poverty is involuntary may be proved, if proof be necessary,
    by the magnitude of charitable work that aims to help only the &quot;deserving
    poor&quot;; and as to undeserving cases &#8212; the cases of voluntary poverty &#8212; who
    can say but that they, if not due to birth and training in the environs of
    degraded poverty, 35 are the despairing culminations of long-continued struggles
    for respectable ndependence? 36 How can we know that they are not essentially
    like the rest &#8212; involuntary and deserving? It is a profound distinction
    that a clever writer of fiction 37 makes when he speaks of &quot;the hopeful
    and the hopeless poor.&quot; There is, indeed, little difference between
    voluntary and involuntary poverty, between the &quot;deserving&quot; and
    the &quot;undeserving&quot; poor, except that the &quot;deserving&quot; still
    have hope, while from the &quot;undeserving&quot; all hope, if they ever
    knew any, has gone.</p>

    <p><font size="-1">35. The leader of one of the labor strikes of the early eighties, a hard-working,

        he himself suffered as a workingman were as nothing compared with the fear
        for the future of his children that he felt whenever he thought of the repulsive
        surroundings, physical and moral, in which, owing to his poverty, he was
        compelled to bring them up.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Professor Francis Wayland, Dean of the Yale law school,
        wrote in the Charities Review for March, 1893: &quot;Under our eyes and
        within our reach, children are being reared from infancy amid surroundings
        containing every conceivable
        element of degradation, depravity and vice. Why, then, should we be surprised
        that we are surrounded by a horde of juvenile delinquents, that the police
        reports in our cities teem with the exploits of precocious little villains,
        that reform schools are crowded with hopelessly abandoned young offenders?
        How could it be otherwise? What else could be expected from such antecedents,
        from such ever-present examples of flagrant vice? Short of a miracle,
        how could any child escape the moral contagion of such an environment?
        How could
        he retain a single vestige of virtue, a single honest impulse, a single
        shred of respect for the rights of others, after passing through such
        an ordeal
        of iniquity? What is there left on which to build up a better character?</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">In the Arena of July, 1893, Helen Campbell says, &quot;It
        would seem at times as if the workshop meant only a form of preparation
        for the hospital,
        the workhouse and the prison, since the workers therein become inoculated
        with trade diseases, mutilated by trade appliances, and corrupted by
      trade associates till no healthy fiber, mental, moral or physical, remains.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">36. Some years ago a gentleman, now well and favorably known in New York
        public life, told me of a ragged tramp whom he had brought, more to gratify
        a whim perhaps than in any spirit of philanthropy, from a neighboring camp
        of tramps to his house for breakfast. After breakfast the host asked his

        seventies I lost my job. For a while we lived upon our little savings; but
        sickness came and our savings were used up. My wife and children died. Everything
        was gone but self-respect. Then I traveled, looking for work which could
        not be had at home. I traveled afoot; I could afford no other way. For days
        I hunted for work, begging food and sleeping in barns or under trees; but
        no work could I get. Once or twice I was arrested as a vagrant. Then I fell
        in with a party of tramps and with them drifted into the city. Winter came
        on. I still had a desire to regain my old place as a self-respecting man,
        but work was scarce and nothing that I could do could I find to do, except
        some little job now and then which was given to me as pennies are given to
        beggars. I slept mostly in station houses. Part of the time I was undergoing
        sentence for vagrancy. In the spring I tramped again. But now I did not hunt
        for work. My self-respect was gone so completely that I had no ambition to
        regain it. I was a loafer and a jail-bird. I had no family to support, and
        I had found that, barring the question of self-respect, I was about as well
        off as were average workmen. After years of tramping this opinion is unchanged.
        I am always sure of enough to eat and a place to sleep in &#8212; not very
        good often, but good enough. I should not be sure of that if I were a workingman.
        I might lose my job and go hungry rather than beg. I might be unable to pay
        my rent and so be turned upon the street. I might marry again and have a
        family which would be condemned to the hard life of the average workingman's
        family. And as for society, why, I have society. Tramps are good fellows &#8212; sociable
        fellows, bright fellows many of them. Life as a tramp is not half bad when
        you compare it with the workingman's life, leaving out the question of self-respect,
        of course. You must leave that out. No man can be a tramp for good until
        he loses that. But a period of hard times makes many a chap lose it. And
        as I have lost it I would rather be a tramp than a workingman. I have tried
        both. By the way, Mr. &#8212;&#8212;, this is a very good cigar &#8212; this
        brand of yours. I seldom smoke much better cigars.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The facts in detail of this man's story may have been
        false; they probably were. But so were the facts in detail of Bunyan's &quot;Pilgrim's Progress.&quot; There
        is, however, a distinction between fact and truth, and no matter how
        false the man's facts may have been, his story, like Bunyan's, was essentially
        true. Much of the poverty that upon the surface seems to be voluntary
        and
        undeserving comes from a growing feeling among those who work hardest
        that, as Cowper describes it, they are</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">At Victoria, B.C., in the spring of 1894, I witnessed a canoe race in which
        there were two contestants and but one prize. Long before the winner had
        reached the goal his adversary, who found himself far behind, turned his
        canoe toward the shore and dropped out of the race. Was it because he was
        too lazy to paddle? Not at all. It was because he realized the hopelessness
        of the effort.</font><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Do you question the relationship between taxation and righteousness?
Let us see. If government is a natural growth, then surely God's
natural law provides food and sustenance for government as that food is
needed; for where in Nature do we find a creature coming into the world
without timely provision of natural food for it? It is in our system of
taxation that we find the most emphatic denial of the Fatherhood of God
and the Brotherhood of Man, because, first, in order to meet our common
needs, we take from individuals what does not belong to us in common;
second, we permit individuals to take for themselves what does belong
to us in common; thus, third, under the pretext of taxation for public
purposes, we have established a system that permits some men to tax
other men for private profit.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Does not that violate the natural, the divine law? Does it not
surely
beget wolfish greed on the one hand, and gaunt poverty on the other?
Does it not surely breed millionaires on one end of the social scale
and tramps on the other end? Has it not brought into civilization a
hell, of which the savage can have no conception? Could any better
system be devised for convincing men that God is the father of a few
and the stepfather of the many? Is not that destructive of the
sentiment of brotherhood? With such a condition, how is it possible for
men in masses to obey the new commandment, "that ye love one another"?
What could more surely thrust men apart? What could more surely divide
them into warring classes? ... <a href="../docs/Fels.html"><span

<blockquote>
  <p>It is to the newer countries &#8212; that is, to the countries where material
    progress is yet in its earlier stages &#8212; that laborers emigrate in search
    of higher
    wages, and capital flows in search of higher interest. It is in the older
    countries &#8212; that
      is to say, the countries where material progress has reached later stages &#8212; that
      widespread destitution is found in the midst of the greatest abundance.
    Go into one of the new communities where Anglo-Saxon vigor is just beginning
    the
    race of progress;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>where the machinery of production and exchange is yet rude and inefficient;</li>
    <li>where the increment of wealth is not yet great enough to enable any class
          to live in ease and luxury;</li>
    <li>where the best house is but a cabin of logs or a cloth and paper shanty,
          and the richest man is forced to daily work</li>
  </ul>
  <p>and though you will find an absence of wealth and all its concomitants, you
    will find no beggars. There is no luxury, but there is no destitution. No one
    makes an easy living, nor a very good living; but every one can make a living,
    and no one able and willing to work is oppressed by the fear of want.</p>
  <p><B>But just as such a community realizes the conditions which all civilized
      communities are striving for, and advances in the scale of material progress &#8212; just
      as closer settlement and a more intimate connection with the rest of the
      world, and greater utilization of labor-saving machinery, make possible
      greater economies in production and exchange, and wealth in consequence
      increases,
      not merely in the aggregate, but in proportion to population &#8212; <I>so
      does poverty take a darker aspect</I>.</B> Some get an infinitely better
      and easier living, but others find it hard to get a living at. The "<strong>tramp</strong>" comes
      with the locomotive, and alms houses and prisons areas surely the marks
      of "material
      progress" as are costly dwellings, rich warehouses, and magnificent churches.
      Upon streets lighted with gas and controlled by uniformed policemen, beggars
      wait for the passer-by, and in the shadow of college, and library, and
      museum, are gathering the more hideous Huns and fiercer Vandals of whom
      Macaulay
      prophesied. ... <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/ppintro.html">read the

      Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
      14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
      X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
      is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
      of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
      and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
      the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
  <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils arising
      from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are becoming more
      and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents of progress,
      but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they will not cure
      themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
      greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
      previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that these evils are not
      imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
      which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
      an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
  <p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men, and
      all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
      In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely
    offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice &#8212; for,
    so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems
    to be
      the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and
    asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform
    ourselves
      to the law &#8212; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution
          of wealth and power; </li>
    <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
    <li>tame the ruthless passions of greed; </li>
    <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
    <li>light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; </li>
    <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse to discovery; </li>
    <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
    <li>make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men
      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
      inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
      by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political rights
      will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of nature.
      Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes, as population
      increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment
      at starvation wages. </strong>This is the truth that we have ignored. And so</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>there come beggars in our streets and tramps on our roads; and</strong></li>
    <li><strong> poverty enslaves men who we boast are political sovereigns</strong>;
      and</li>
    <li> want breeds ignorance that our schools cannot enlighten; and</li>
    <li> citizens vote as their masters dictate; and</li>
    <li> the demagogue usurps the part of the statesman; and</li>
    <li> gold weighs in the scales of justice; and</li>
    <li> in high places sit those who do not pay to civic virtue even the compliment
          of hypocrisy; and</li>
    <li> the pillars of the republic that we thought so strong already bend under
          an increasing strain. ...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers born
      of progress, forces have entered the world that will either compel us to a
      higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as civilization after
      civilization, have been overwhelmed before. It is the delusion which precedes
      destruction that sees in the popular unrest with which the civilized world
      is feverishly pulsing only the passing effect of ephemeral causes. <strong>Between
      democratic ideas and the aristocratic adjustments of society there is an irreconcilable
      conflict.</strong> Here in the United States, as there in Europe, it may be seen arising.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong> We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and then
          refusing them the right to earn an honest living.</strong></li>
    <li><strong> We cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then
            denying the inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator. </strong>... <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">read the whole
