    </div>
  <p>Women have long been in the workplace, though at one time most were
    not there by choice; 125 years ago, children were also employed in many of
    our
    largest cities.</p>
  <p>When middle-class and upper-middle class women entered the workplace in
    large numbers in the second half of the 20th century, most seemed to be seeking
    self-actualization.
    But within not more than 20 years, we've reached the point that most women,
    even those with several young children, no longer see themselves as having
    a real economic choice about whether to work. The cost of living has risen &#8212; and
    particularly the cost of housing &#8212; as documented by Elizabeth Warren
    and Amelian Tyagi in their recent book, <em>The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class
    Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke</em>. Middle class families no longer have
    the built-in insurance provided by having only one spouse employed, they have
    less
    discretionary income than did their parents' generation, and they have higher
    fixed costs, including child care. The large group of two-income families have
    bid up housing costs. Families with only one income earner simply can't compete
    with them, whether it be a single-parent family or a family which chooses to
    keep one parent at home with the children.</p>
  <p>It gives one pause to consider how different life might be for millions
    of Americans if, before women entered the workforce in search of career satisfaction,
    we had moved to land value taxation. Instead of the price of housing being
    bid up, creating big winners and lots of losers, the commons would have collected
    some of the land value increase &#8212; and left the wages in the pockets
    of those who earned them.</p>
  <p>The next horizon? Enough leisure, for both men and women, at all points
    on the income and wealth spectrums, to enjoy life, rather than simply
    being workers. </p>

  Henry George: <a href="../../../wealthandwant/HG/Ode_to_Liberty.html">Ode to
  Liberty&nbsp;</a> (1877 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our primary
      social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one man to own the
      land on which and from which other men must live, we have made them his
      bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on. </span>This
      is the subtle alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
      the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
      is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which
      has been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political
      freedom, and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</small><br>
      <strong><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is this that turns the blessings
  of material progress into a curse. </span>It is this that crowds human beings
  into noisome cellars and squalid tenement houses; that fills prisons and brothels;
  that goads men with want and consumes them with greed; that robs women of the
  grace and beauty of perfect womanhood; that takes from little children the
  joy and innocence of life&#8217;s morning.&nbsp; ...</small></strong><br>
  <br>
  <small> In the very centers of our civilization today are want and suffering
  enough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his eyes and steel his
  nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to relieve it? Supposing the
  prayer were heard, and at the behest with which the universe sprang into being
  there should glow in the sun a greater power; new virtue fill the air; fresh
  vigor the soil; that for every blade of grass that now grows two should spring
  up, and the seed that now increases fifty-fold should increase a hundredfold!
  Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever benefit would
  accrue would be but temporary. The new powers streaming through the material
  universe could be utilized only through land. And land, being private property,
  the classes that now monopolize the bounty of the Creator would monopolize
  all the new bounty. Land owners would alone be benefited. Rents would increase,
  but wages would still tend to the starvation point!</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a fact of
  experience. We know it because we have seen it. Within our own times, under
  our very eyes, that Power which is above all, and in all, and through all;
  that Power of which the whole universe is but the manifestation; that Power
  which maketh all things, and without which is not anything made that is made,
  has increased the bounty which men may enjoy, as truly as though the fertility
  of nature had been increased. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Into the mind of one came the thought that harnessed steam for the
      service of mankind. </small></li>
  <li><small>To the inner ear of another was whispered the secret that compels
      the lightning to bear a message around the globe. </small></li>
  <li><small>In every direction have the laws of matter been revealed; in every
      department of industry have arisen arms of iron and fingers of steel, whose
      effect upon the production of wealth has been precisely the same as an
      increase in the fertility of nature. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
      has been the result? Simply that land owners get all the gain. The wonderful
      discoveries and inventions of our century have neither increased wages
      nor lightened toil. The effect has simply been to make the few richer;
      the many more helpless! </span>Can it be that the gifts of the Creator
      may be thus misappropriated with impunity? Is it a light thing that labor
      should be robbed of its earnings while greed rolls in wealth &#8212; that
      the many should want while the few are surfeited? Turn to history, and
      on every page may be read the lesson that such wrong never goes unpunished;
      that the Nemesis that follows injustice never falters nor sleeps! Look
      around today. Can this state of things continue? May we even say, &#8220;After
      us the deluge!&#8221; Nay; the pillars of the state are trembling even
      now, and the very foundations of society begin to quiver with pent-up forces
      that glow underneath. The struggle that must either revivify, or convulse
      in ruin, is near at hand, if it be not already begun. The fiat has gone
      forth! <span style="font-weight: bold;">With steam and electricity, and
      the new powers born of progress, forces have entered the world that will
      either compel us to a higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation,
      as civilization after civilization, have been overwhelmed before.</span> It
      is the delusion which precedes destruction that sees in the popular unrest
      with which the civilized world is feverishly pulsing only the passing effect
      of ephemeral causes. Between democratic ideas and the aristocratic adjustments
      of society there is an irreconcilable conflict. Here in the United States,
      as there in Europe, it may be seen arising. </small></div>

<p>  Henry George:&nbsp; <a
 href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
   Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">    </a>It is the year of grace 1881, and of the Republic the 105th. The
      girl who has brought in coal for my fire is twenty years old. She was
      born in New York, and can neither read nor write. To me, when I heard
      it, this seemed sin and shame, and I got her a spelling-book. She is
      trying what she can, but it is uphill work. She has really no time.
      Last night when I came in, at eleven, she was not through scrubbing the
      halls. She gets four dollars a month. Her shoes cost two dollars a
      pair. She says she can sew; but I guess it is about as I can. In the
      natural course of things, this girl will be a mother of citizens of the
      Republic.<br>
    <br>
    Underneath are girls who can sew; they run sewing-machines with their
      feet all day. I have seen girls in Asia carrying water-jugs on their
      heads and young women in South America bearing burdens. They were lithe
      and strong and symmetrical; but to turn a young woman into motive power
      for a sewing-machine is to weaken and injure her physically. And these
      girls are to rear, or ought to rear, citizens of the Republic.<br>
    <br>
    But there is worse and worse than this. Go out into the streets at
      night, and you will find them filled with girls who will never be
      mothers. To the man who has known the love of mother, of sister, of
      sweetheart, wife, and daughter, this is the saddest sight of all.<br>
    <br>
    The ladies of the Brooklyn churches &#8211; they are getting up petitions for
      the suppression of Mormon polygamy; they would have it rooted out with
      pains and penalties, trampled out, if need be, with fire and sword; and
      their reverend Congressman-elect is going, when he takes his seat, to
      introduce a most stringent bill to that end; for that a man should have
      more wives than one is a burning scandal in a Christian country. So it
      is; but there are also other burning scandals. As for scandals that
      excite talk, I will spare Brooklyn a comparison with Salt Lake. But as
      to ordinary things: I have walked through the streets of Salt Lake
      City, by day and by night, without seeing what in the streets of New
      York or Brooklyn excites no comment. Polygamy is unnatural and wrong,
      no doubt of that, for Nature brings into the world something over
      twenty-two boys for every twenty girls. But is not a state of society
      unnatural and wrong in which there are thousands and thousands of girls
      for whom no husband ever offers? Can we brag of a state of society in
      which one citizen can load his wife with more diamonds than an Indian
      chief can put beads on his squaw, while many other citizens are afraid
      to marry lest they cannot support a wife &#8211; a state of society in which
      prostitution flourishes? Polygamy is bad, but is it not better than
      that? Civilization is advancing day by day; never was such progress as
      we are making! Yet divorces are increasing and insanity is increasing.
      What is the goal of a civilization that tends toward free love and the
      madhouse? ... .<a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html"> <span

<blockquote>
  <p>I AM convinced that we make a great mistake in depriving one sex of voice
    in public matters, and that we could in no way so increase the attention,
    the intelligence and the devotion which may be brought to the solution of
    social problems as by enfranchising our women. Even if in a ruder state of
    society the intelligence of one sex suffices for the management of common
    interests, the vastly more intricate, more delicate and more important questions
    which the progress of civilization makes of public moment, require the intelligence
    of women as of men, and that we never can obtain until we interest them in
    public affairs. And I have come to believe that very much of the inattention,
    the flippancy, the want of conscience, which we see manifested in regard
    to public matters of the greatest moment, arises from the fact that we debar
    our women from taking their proper part in these matters. Nothing will fully
    interest men unless it also interests women. There are those who say that
    women are less intelligent than men; but who will say that they are less
    influential? &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp22.html">Social
