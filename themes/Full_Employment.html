Employment, Growth And Progress On A Small Planet:
Relieving Poverty While Healing The Earth</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George&#8217;s core ideas include a
formula for achieving full
employment and relieving the poverty of the landless without any need
to extend the bounds of settlement nearly as far as has already
occurred. It is a matter of substituting labor for land, in many
respects and dimensions, as sketched above. It is not a matter of
going against the market, primarily, for well-oiled markets contain
their own price incentives to foster approprate technology. It is a
matter, rather, of removing tax biases that presently warp the market
the wrong ways. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are some crudities, errors
and omissions in George&#8217;s
writings, but none of them is central or powerful enough to annul the
relevant core of truth. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Herbert J. G. Bab:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Bab_PT_Unemployment.html">Property Tax -- Cause of
  Unemployment</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Under the impact of spectacular advances in
technology the actual level of employment and production falls short of
the full use of our manpower and industrial capacity. ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In view of this it would be
difficult
to contend that we have solved the twin problems of full employment and
economic growth. The truth is that we have lived all these postwar
years on borrowed time.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What have these
considerations to do with property taxation? The purpose of my talk is
to show that the relation of property taxation to unemployment and lack
of economic growth is that of cause to effect.</span> I shall try to
explain why I believe that property taxation is one of the two chief
villains in the drama we are witnessing today in these United States.
The other villain is the monetary policy pursued by the government,
which has increased the cost of borrowing to a point where it stifles
the growth of the economy. In this context however I shall be concerned
only with property taxation. <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">An analysis of the social and
economic
effects of a particular tax system would indicate the third criterion.</span>
</small><br>
<br>
<small>When analysing property taxes we shall distinguish between that
part of
the tax which is assessed on improvements and that part which is
assessed on land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>That part of the tax that is assessed on buildings penalizes
everybody
who improves his land, his buildings or intends to construct
residential, commercial or industrial property. The most serious
incidence of property taxes is on new housing. When rental property or
houses are newly constructed these taxes add 15 to 20% to the annual
cost depending on assessment practices and tax rates. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The ever widening gap
between
the level of rentals and the urban family income constitutes a rental
squeeze, which has brought untold misery and hardship to families in
the lower income group, especially to those belonging to minority
groups. The rental squeeze has also aggravated overcrowding and slum
conditions.</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">In
the
press, on the radio and on television we are often warned about the
threat of inflation. Hardly ever are we told, that the increase in the
cost of living is to a large extent due to the increase in housing
costs brought about by the housing shortage.</span> The inflationary
effects of property taxation are reinforced by the fact that property
taxes themselves are included in the cost of living index and that
property tax rates have the tendency to rise.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To
the
extent that property taxes discourage residential construction and the
improvement and modernization of homes they create unemployment.</span>
The housing construction industry employed about 2,200,000 people in
1962, that is about 1.4 persons per housing unit. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Any change in the direction of
home building employment is multiplied 2.57 times. </span>Thus an
increase in housing starts by 50% would give employment to 2.8 million
persons. An increase by about 66.6% or by 2/3 would create about 3.6
million jobs. These figures do not take into consideration the
investment in public utilities, streets, schools etc., that would be
required to service these additional housing units. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by
taxing land at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have
increased tremendously during recent years. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For instance in Los Angeles county the
assessed value of land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002
millions in 1962, an increase of a little over 100%. </span>The
assessed values, are supposed to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the unearned increment in land values
during this period amounted to not less than $8 billions.</span> Even
this figure is an understatement because it is based on assessed values
and land is greatly underassessed. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While land
values have risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land
averaged about 1.5%. Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land
would have earned about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from
its proper use.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>A higher tax on vacant or unimproved land would make it
unprofitable to
hold such lands. It will tax land into better use and it will lead to a
spurt in construction activity. While all other taxes are deterrents to
employment and economic growth, though to a varying extent, land taxes
are the only genuine incentive taxes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inflated land values must
necessarily
increase the cost of new homes, the cost of home-ownership and rentals.</span>
It discourages residential construction, prices many families out of
the housing market and aggravates the housing shortage.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The most serious defect in the
administration of property taxation is the continuous, widespread and
enormous underassessment of land. A survey made recently found that in
9 California counties, vacant lots and acreage were assessed at only
5.3% of the cash value, while residential property was assessed at
19.3% of its value. The illegal underassessment of land deprives local
governments of millions of dollars of revenues. Moreover, it further
aggravates the serious defects of property taxation.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on
improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not
identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
paradox of property taxation
consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
improvements produce the same results as lower rates on land.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
