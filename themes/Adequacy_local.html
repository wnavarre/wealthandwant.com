<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Three criteria are generally
used to judge the merits of a tax. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, it must be satisfactory as a revenue producer, 
  </small></li>
  <li><small>second it must be equitable and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>third its economic effects should not collide with the
public
interest. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For instance if full employment
and economic growth are regarded as
desirable, the question to be examined is what effects will this tax
have on achieving these objectives?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The shortcomings of property
taxes as
revenue producers have been obvious for a long time and are widely known</span>.
The main difficulty is that revenues from property taxation do not keep
pace with the ever-increasing requirements of local governments. Every
county, every city official and every school administrator will
testify, that there are not enough funds available to meet the
requirements of local governments.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The inability of local government to raise enough revenues from
property taxation has forced them to borrow at an ever-increasing rate.
The debts of local governments have increased from about $16 billions
in 1947 to over $61 billions in 1963, an increase of about 382%. During
the same period private debt increased by 279% and federal debt by only
26%. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To satisfy the second
criterion, a tax
must be equitable. </span>It must be either based on the ability to
pay principle or on the benefit principle.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">An analysis of the social and
economic
effects of a particular tax system would indicate the third criterion.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>When analysing property taxes we shall distinguish between that
part of
the tax which is assessed on improvements and that part which is
assessed on land. </small><br>
<br>
<small>That part of the tax that is assessed on buildings penalizes
everybody
who improves his land, his buildings or intends to construct
residential, commercial or industrial property. The most serious
incidence of property taxes is on new housing. When rental property or
houses are newly constructed these taxes add 15 to 20% to the annual
cost depending on assessment practices and tax rates. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To
the
extent that property taxes discourage residential construction and the
improvement and modernization of homes they create unemployment.</span>
... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Under our property tax system wealthy communities with expensive
homes
or with heavy concentration of industry will have a large tax basis and
low tax rates. Schools will be good and public services will be
adequate. Yet in a poor community the tax base will be much smaller,
tax rates will be much higher and still it will be found impossible to
provide for good schools and adequate public services.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In a pamphlet entitled <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Paying for better
schools</span> the Committee for Economic Development came to the
conclusion that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"where a
child happens to live is likely to be important in determining the
quality of his education. In some areas children are taught by meagerly
qualified teachers in substandard schools with inadequate equipment.
The school session is shorter and the school leaving age is lower than
the national average."</span></small><br
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A
defect
of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
....</small><br>
<br>
<small>Professor Galbraith and others have expressed concern about the
poverty
of the public sector of our economy as compared to the affluence of the
private sector. The appearance of our cities, the inadequate financial
support we give our schools and poor public services seem to support
this view. Yet, I can not agree with Professor Galbraith's conclusion
that we need more public revenues to meet these needs. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It seems to me that the spreading out of
our cities over wider and wider metropolitan areas has immeasurably
increased the financial burden of local governments. In other words,
wasteful use of land caused by our property tax system is the real
reason of the poverty of the public sector.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>It stands to reason that the spreading out of our cities into
wider and
wider metropolitan areas is a very costly venture. For instance it was
found that in the New York region suburbs have to make capital outlays
of $68 per capita for new housing, while only $44 was required for new
housing in the central cities and only $38 in the non-metropolitan
area. Another survey found that it costs $80 per household to provide
water in the outlying suburbs against $30 in the city. <small><small><big><big><a

<p>Louis Post: <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">Outlines of Louis F. Post's
    Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix:
    FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q2. Would the single tax yield revenue sufficient for all kinds of government?</em><br />
A. Thomas G. Shearman, Esq., of New York, estimates that sixty-five per cent
  of the rent that the land in the United States now yields actually and potentially
  to its owners, would be sufficient. But whether it would or not is as yet an
  unimportant question. If all revenues ought to be raised from land values,
  then no revenues should be drawn from other sources while any land value remains
  in private possession. Until land values are exhausted the taxation of labor
  cannot be excused.</p>
  <p><em>Q3. In an interior or frontier town, where land has but little value, how
    would you raise enough money for schools, highways, and other public needs?</em><br />
  A. There is no town whose finances are reasonably managed in which the land
  values are insufficient for local needs. Schools, highways, and so forth, are
  not local but general, and should be maintained from the land values of the
  state at large.</p>
  <p><em>Q4. What disposition would you make of the revenues that exceeded the needs
    of government?</em><br />
  A. The people who ask this question ought to settle it with those who want
  to know whether the single tax would yield revenue enough. I do not believe
  that public revenues under the single tax would exceed the just needs of economical
  government; in better highways, better sidewalks, better wharves, better schools,
  better public service of various kinds, we should find sufficient demand for
  all our revenues. But the question of deficiency or surplus is one to be met
  and disposed of when it arises. The present question is the wisdom and the
  justice of applying land values to common use, as far as they will go or as
  much of them as may be needed as the case may prove to be.</p>
