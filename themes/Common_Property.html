<blockquote>
  <p>America is in the midst of an interesting debate: what should be privatized,
      and what should be common property. Proposals for an &quot;Ownership Society&quot; seem
      to intend to privatize risk and reward, suggesting that the community has
      little responsibility other than charity for those who fall behind or are inherently
      disadvantaged. </p>
  <p>And yet when that which <em>should</em> be common property is totally privatized,
      most people are the losers.</p>
  <p>Georgists believe that the economic value of the gifts of nature and the
    social surplus should not be private property, but are our common birthright
    and therefore
      their economic value should be collected and used for common purposes.
    On the flip side, Georgists hold that what the individual produces &#8212; once
    he has compensated the rest of us for the bits of nature he has claimed as
    his own &#8212; is
    rightly his
      private property.</p>
  <p>And common property is different from government property, a distinction
    that may not come easily to all readers.</p>

    <p><small>The distinction between common

            inalienable rights. State property is that which the state actually
            owns, and can dispose of as it sees fit. For example, a public right
            of way is literally a right of way. Under principles of common law,
            nobody, not even the king, could close a traveled road and make it
            private property. A state maintenance truck, on the other hand, is
            state property, which can be sold if it no longer suits state
            purposes.</small>

  <blockquote>
      <p>Assets in the commons are meant to be preserved regardless of their
        return to capital. Just as we receive them as shared gifts, so we have
        a duty to pass them on in at least the same condition as we received
        them. If we can add to their value, so much the better, but at a minimum
        we must not degrade them, and we certainly have no right to destroy them.</p>
      <p>Besides the commons, I use a few similar-sounding terms that should
        be clarified here as well.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>  By common wealth I mean the monetary and nonmonetary value of
          all the assets in the commons. Like stockholders&#8217; equity in a
          corporation, it may increase or decrease from year to year depending
          on how well
          the commons is managed.</li>
        <li>  By common property I mean a class of human-made rights that lies
              somewhere between private property and state property. Like private
              property, common
        property arises when the state recognizes it. Unlike private property,
              it&#8217;s
        inclusive rather than exclusive &#8212; it strives to share ownership
        as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible.</li>
        <li>  By the commons sector I mean an organized sector of our economy.
              It embraces some of the gifts we inherit together, but not all.
              In effect,
          it&#8217;s a
          subset of the given commons that we consciously organize according
          to commons principles. It&#8217;s small at the moment, but the point
          of this book is that we should enlarge it. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    <blockquote>
      <p>In the beginning, the commons was everywhere. Humans and other animals
        roamed around it, hunting and gathering. Like other species, we had territories,
        but these were tribal, not individual.</p>
      <p>About ten thousand years ago, human agriculture and permanent settlements
        arose, and with them came private property. Rulers granted ownership
        of land to heads of families (usually males). Often, military conquerors
        distributed land to their lieutenants. Titles could then be passed to
        heirs &#8212; typically, oldest sons got everything.</p>
      <p>In Europe, Roman law codified many of these practices. Despite the growth
        in private property, much land in Europe remained part of the commons.
        In Roman times, bodies of water, shorelines, wildlife, and air were explicitly
        classified as res communes, resources available to all. During the Middle
        Ages, kings and feudal lords often claimed title to rivers, forests,
        and wild animals, only to have such claims periodically rebuked. The
        Magna Carta, which King John of England was forced to sign in 1215, established
        forests and fisheries as res communes. Given that forests were sources
        of game, firewood, building materials, medicinal herbs, and grazing for
        livestock, this was no small shift. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

        granted. At other times, it&#8217;s given a name: the public trust. Several
        states actually put this duty in writing. Pennsylvania&#8217;s constitution,
        for example, declares: &#8220;Pennsylvania&#8217;s public natural resources
        are the common property of all the people, including generations yet
        to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve
        and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.&#8221; Note that
        in this constitutional dictum, serving as trustee of natural resources
        isn&#8217;t an option for the state, it&#8217;s an affirmative duty.

      <p>Propertize, But Don&#8217;t Privatize</p>
      <p>Simply turning the commons over to corporations, without compensation
        or further ado, is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. There&#8217;s
        no guarantee the corporations will preserve the asset, much less share
        its benefits widely. We&#8217;re asked to believe that corporate owners
        will do the right things, either because it&#8217;s in their self-interest
        or because they&#8217;re socially responsible, but historical evidence
        and the inner logic of corporations suggest otherwise.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s possible to propertize a natural inheritance
        without privatizing it, and in the next chapter I&#8217;ll show how this
        can work. The basic idea is to turn pieces of the commons into common
        property rather than corporate property. This would let us charge corporations
        higher (and truer) prices for using the commons, while sharing the benefits
        of those higher prices broadly. And it would ensure that the quantity
        of usage rights sold &#8212; which is to say, the level of pollution
        allowed &#8212; is set with the interests of future generations foremost
        in mind. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    <blockquote>
      <p>        There&#8217;s nothing about property rights, however, that requires them
        to be concentrated in profit-maximizing hands. You could, for example,
        set up a trust to own a forest, or certain forest rights, on behalf of
        future generations. These property rights would talk as loudly as shares
        of Pacific Lumber stock, but their purpose would be very different: to
        preserve the forest rather than to exploit it. If the Lorax had owned
        some of these rights, Dr. Seuss&#8217;s tale (and Pacific Lumber&#8217;s)
        would have ended more happily.</p>
      <p>Imagine a whole set of property rights like this. Let&#8217;s call them,
        generically, <strong>common property rights</strong>. If such property rights didn&#8217;t
        exist, there&#8217;d be a strong case for inventing them. Fortunately,
        they do exist in a variety of forms &#8212; for example, land or easements
        held in perpetual trust, as by the Nature Conservancy, and corporate
        assets managed on behalf of a broad community, as by the Alaska Permanent
        Fund.</p>
      <p>Some forms of common property include individual shares &#8212; again,
        the Alaska Permanent Fund is an example. These individual shares, however,
        differ from shares in private corporations. They&#8217;re not securities
        you can trade in a market; rather, they depend on your membership in
        the community. If you emigrate or die, you lose your share. Conversely,
        when you&#8217;re born into the community, your share is a birthright.</p>
      <p>I recognize that, for some, turning common wealth into any kind of property
        is a sacrilege. As Chief Seattle of the Suquamish tribe put it, &#8220;How
        can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land?&#8221; I empathize
        deeply with this sentiment. However, I&#8217;ve come to believe that
        it&#8217;s more disrespectful of the sky to pollute it without limit
        or payment than to turn it into common property held in trust for future
        generations. Hence, I favor <strong>propertization</strong>, but not privatization. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    <blockquote>
      <p>Dividends from Common Assets</p>
      <p>A cushion of reliable income is a wonderful thing. It can be saved for
        rainy days or used to pursue happiness on sunny days. It can encourage
        people to take risks, care for friends and relatives, or volunteer for
        community service. For low-income families, it can pay for basic necessities.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the absence of reliable income is a terrible thing. It heightens
        anxiety and fear. It diminishes our ability to cope with crises and transitions.
        It traps many families on the knife&#8217;s edge of poverty, and makes
        it harder for the poor to rise.</p>
      <p>So why don&#8217;t we, as <em>Monopoly</em> does, pay everyone some
        regular income &#8212; not through redistribution of income, but through
        predistribution of common property? One state &#8212; Alaska &#8212; already
        does this. As noted earlier, the Alaska Permanent Fund uses revenue from
        state oil leases to invest in stocks, bonds, and similar assets, and
        from those investments pays yearly dividends to every resident. Alaska&#8217;s
        model can be extended to any state or nation, whether or not they have
        oil. We could, for instance, have an American Permanent Fund that pays
        equal dividends to long-term residents of all 50 states. The reason is,
        we jointly own many valuable assets.</p>
      <p>Recall our discussion about common property trusts. These trusts could
        crank down pollution and earn money from selling ever-scarcer pollution
        permits. The scarcer the permits get, the higher their prices would go.
        Less pollution would equal more revenue. Over time, trillions of dollars
        could flow into an American Permanent Fund.</p>
      <p>What could we do with that common income? In Alaska the deal with oil
        revenue is 75 percent to government and 25 percent to citizens. For an
        American Permanent Fund, I&#8217;d favor a 50/50 split, because paying
        dividends to citizens is so important. Also, when scarce ecosystems are
        priced above zero, the cost of living will go up and people will need
        compensation; this wasn&#8217;t, and isn&#8217;t, the case in Alaska.
        I&#8217;d also favor earmarking the government&#8217;s dollars for specific
        public goods, rather than tossing them into the general treasury. This
        not only ensures identifiable public benefits; it also creates constituencies
        who&#8217;ll defend the revenue sharing system.</p>
      <p>Waste absorption isn&#8217;t the only common resource an American Permanent
        Fund could tap. Consider also, the substantial contribution society makes
        to stock market values. As noted earlier, private corporations can inflate
        their value dramatically by selling shares on a regulated stock exchange.
        The extra value derives from the enlarged market of investors who can
        now buy the corporation&#8217;s shares. Given a total stock market valuation
        of about $15 trillion, this socially created liquidity premium is worth
        roughly $5 trillion.</p>
      <p>At the moment, this $5 trillion gift flows mostly to the 5 percent of
        the population that own more than half the private wealth. But if we
        wanted to, we could spread it around. We could do that by charging corporations
        for using the public trading system, just as investment bankers do. (For
        those of you who haven&#8217;t been involved in a public stock offering,
        investment bankers are like fancy doormen to a free palace. While the
        public charges almost nothing to use the capital markets, investment
        bankers exact hefty fees.)</p>
      <p>The public&#8217;s fee could be in cash or stock. Let&#8217;s say we
        required publicly traded companies to deposit 1 percent of their shares
        each year in the American Permanent Fund for ten years &#8212; reaching
        a total of 10 percent of their shares. This would be our price not just
        for using a regulated stock exchange, but also for all the other privileges
        (limited liability, perpetual life, copyrights and patents, and so on)
        that we currently bestow on private corporations for free.</p>
      <p>In due time, the American Permanent Fund would have a diversified portfolio
        worth several trillion dollars. Like its Alaskan counterpart, it would
        pay equal yearly dividends to everyone. As the stock market rose and
        fell, so would everyone&#8217;s dividend checks. A rising tide would
        lift all boats. America would truly be an &#8220;ownership society.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
