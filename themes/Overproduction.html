</div>
<br>
Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If poverty is appointed by the
power which is above us all, then it is no crime; but if poverty is
unnecessary, then it is a crime for which society is responsible and
for which society must suffer. I hold, and I think no one who looks at
the facts can fail to see, that poverty is utterly unnecessary. It is
not by the decree of the Almighty, but it is because of our own
injustice, our own selfishness, our own ignorance, that this scourge,
worse than any pestilence, ravages our civilisation, bringing want and
suffering and degradation, destroying souls as well as bodies. Look
over the world, in this heyday of nineteenth century civilisation. In
every civilised country under the sun you will find men and women whose
condition is worse than that of the savage: men and women and little
children with whom the veriest savage could not afford to exchange.
Even in this new city of yours with virgin soil around you, you have
had this winter to institute a relief society. Your roads have been
filled with tramps, fifteen, I am told, at one time taking shelter in a
round-house here. As here, so everywhere; and poverty is deepest where
wealth most abounds.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What more unnatural than this? There is nothing in nature like
this poverty which today curses us. We see rapine in nature; we see one
species destroying another; but as a general thing animals do not feed
on their own kind; and, wherever we see one kind enjoying plenty, all
creatures of that kind share it. No man, I think, ever saw a herd of
buffalo, of which a few were fat and the great majority lean. No man
ever saw a flock of birds, of which two or three were swimming in
grease and the others all skin and bone. Nor in savage life is there
anything like the poverty that festers in our civilisation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In a rude state of society there are seasons of want, seasons
when people starve; but they are seasons when the earth has refused to
yield her increase, when the rain has not fallen from the heavens, or
when the land has been swept by some foe &#8211; not when there is plenty. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">And yet the
peculiar characteristic of this modern poverty of ours is that it is
deepest where wealth most abounds.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Why, today, while over the civilised world there is so much
distress, so much want, what is the cry that goes up? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What is the current explanation of the hard
times? Overproduction! </span>There are so many clothes that men must
go ragged, so much coal that in the bitter winters people have to
shiver, such over-filled granaries that people actually die by
starvation! Want due to overproduction! Was a greater absurdity ever
uttered? How can there be over-production till all have enough? It is
not over-production; it is unjust distribution.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We talk about over-production.
How can there be such a thing as
overproduction while people want? All these things that are said to
be over-produced are desired by many people. Why do they not get
them? They do not get them because they have not the means to buy
them; not that they do not want them. Why have not they the means to
buy them? They earn too little. When the great masses of men have to
work for an average of $1.40 a day, it is no wonder that great
quantities of goods cannot be sold. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now why is it that men have to
work for such low wages? Because
if they were to demand higher wages there are plenty of unemployed
men ready to step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed
men who compel that fierce competition that drives wages down to the
point of bare subsistence. Why is it that there are men who cannot
get employment? Did you ever think what a strange thing it is that
men cannot find employment? Adam had no difficulty in finding
employment; neither had Robinson Crusoe; the finding of employment
was the last thing that troubled them. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If men cannot find an employer,
why cannot they employ
themselves? Simply because they are shut out from the element on
which human labour can alone be exerted. Men are compelled to compete
with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been
robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves; because
they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
paving some other human creature for the privilege. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the Old Testament we are told
that when
the Israelites journeyed through the desert, they were hungered, and
that God sent manna down out of the heavens. There was enough for all
of them, and they all took it and were relieved. But supposing that
desert had been held as private property, as the soil of Great
Britain is held, as the soil even of our new States is being held;
suppose that one of the Israelites had a square mile, and another one
had twenty square miles, and another one had a hundred square miles,
and the great majority of the Israelites did not have enough to set
the soles of their feet upon, which they could call their
own &#8212; what would become of the manna? What good would it have done
to the majority? Not a whit. Though God had sent down manna enough
for all, that manna would have been the property of the landholders;
they would have employed some of she others perhaps, to gather it up
into heaps for them, and would have sold it to their hungry brethren.
Consider it; this purchase and sale of manna might have gone on until
the majority of Israelites had given all they had, even to the
clothes off their backs. What then? Then they would not have had
anything left to buy manna with, and the consequences would have been
that while they went hungry the manna would have lain in great heaps,
and the landowners would have been complaining of the over-production
of manna. There would have been a great harvest of manna and hungry
people, just precisely the phenomenon that we see today.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Now go into the cities and what do you see! Why, you see even a
lower
depth of poverty; aye, if I would point out the worst of the evils of
land monopoly I would not take you to Connemara; I would not take you
to Skye or Kintire &#8212; I would take you to Dublin or Glasgow or London.
There is something worse than physical deprivation, something worse
than starvation; and that is the degradation of the mind, the death of
the soul. That is what you will find in those cities.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, what is the cause of that? Why, it is plainly to be seen;
the
people driven off the land in the country are driven into the slums of
the cities. For every man that is driven off the land the demand for
the produce of the workmen of the cities is lessened; and the man
himself with his wife and children, is forced among those workmen to
compete upon any terms for a bare living and force wages down. Get work
he must or starve &#8212; get work he must or do that which those people, so
long as they maintain their manly feelings, dread more than death, go
to the alms-houses. That is the reason, here as in Great Britain, that
the cities are overcrowded. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open the
land that is locked up, that is
held by dogs in the manger, who will not use it themselves and will not
allow anybody else to use it, and you would see no more of tramps and
hear no more of over-production. </span>... <a
