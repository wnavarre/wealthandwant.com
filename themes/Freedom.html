<blockquote>
  <p>We talk a lot about freedom and liberty, but do we consider what it means,
      and the extent to which we have it in America, much less what we might
    be able to ask other nations to provide for their citizens? We established
    a nation dedicated to freedom, and yet it took us most of a century to end
    chattel slavery, and we haven't yet ended poverty &#8212; mostly because
    few of us understand the mechanism by which people are impoverished. Read
    on. Henry George sorted it out. See also: <a href="The_Remedy.html">the remedy</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
    Henry George: <a href="../HG/Moses.html">Moses,
    Apostle of Freedom</a>&nbsp; (1878 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Egypt was the mould of the
Hebrew nation &#8211; the matrix, so to
speak, in which a single family, or, at most, a small tribe grew to a
people as numerous as the American people at the time of the
Declaration of Independence. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small> It is not remarkable, therefore, that the ancient Hebrew
institutions show in so many points the influence of Egyptian ideas
and customs. What is remarkable is the dissimilarity.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>For "institutions make men." And when amid a people used to
institutions of one kind, we see suddenly arise institutions of an
opposite kind, we know that behind them must be that active, that
initiative force &#8211; the "men who in the beginnings make
institutions." </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This is what occurs in the
Exodus. The striking differences
between Egyptian and Hebrew polity are not of form, but of essence.
The tendency of the one is to subordination and oppression; of the
other to individual freedom. Strangest of recorded births! From out
of the strongest and most splendid despotism of antiquity comes the
freest republic. From between the paws of the rock-hewn Sphinx rises
the genius of human liberty, and the trumpets of the Exodus throb
with the defiant proclamation of the rights of humanity. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Consider what Egypt was. See
the grandeur of her monuments; those
very monuments &#8211; that after the lapse, not of centuries but of
millenniums, seem to say to us, as the Egyptian priests said to the
boastful Greeks: "Ye are children!" &#8211; testify to the enslavement
of the people, and are the enduring witnesses of a social
organisation that rested on the masses an immovable weight. That
narrow Nile valley, the cradle of the arts and sciences, the scene,
perhaps, of the greatest triumphs of the human mind, is also the
scene of its most abject enslavement. In the long centuries of its
splendour,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> its lord</span>, secure in
the possession of irresistible
temporal power, and securer still in the awful sanctions of a
mystical religion, was as a god on earth, to cover whose poor carcass
with a tomb befitting his state hundreds of thousands toiled away
their lives.</small><br>
<br>
<small> For the classes who came next to him were those who enjoyed all
the sensuous delights of a most luxurious civilisation, and high
intellectual pleasures which the mysteries of the temple hid from
vulgar profanation. But for the millions who constituted the base of
the social pyramid there was but the lash to stimulate their toil,
and the worship of beasts to satisfy the yearnings of the soul. From
time immemorial to the present day the lot of the Egyptian peasants
has been to work and to starve so that those above them might live
daintily. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The outlines that the record
gives us of the character of Moses
&#8211; the brief relations that wherever the Hebrew scriptures are
read have hung the chambers of the imagination with vivid pictures
&#8211; are in every way consistent with this idea. What we know of
the life illustrates what we know of the work. What we know of the
work illumines the life. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It was not an empire such as had
reached full development in
Egypt, or existed in rudimentary patriarchal form in the tribes
around, that Moses aimed to found. Nor was it a republic where the
freedom of the citizen rested on the servitude of the helot, and the
individual was sacrificed to the state. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
was a commonwealth based upon the individual</span> &#8211; a
commonwealth whose ideal it was that every man should sit under his
own vine and fig tree, with none to vex him or make him afraid. It
was a commonwealth: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>in which none should be condemned to ceaseless
toil; in which, for even the bond slave, there should be hope; and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>in
which, for even the beast of burden, there should be rest. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>A
commonwealth in which, in the absence of deep poverty, the many
virtues that spring from personal independence should harden into a
national character&#8211;    </small></li>
  <li><small>a commonwealth in which the family
affections might knit their tendrils around each member, binding with
links stronger than steel the various parts into the living whole. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
It is not the protection of property, but the protection of
humanity, that is the aim of the Mosaic code.</span> Its sanctions are
not
directed to securing the strong in heaping up wealth as much as to
preventing the weak from being crowded to the wall. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">At every point
it
interposes its barriers to the selfish greed that, if left unchecked,
will surely differentiate men into landlord and serf, capitalist and
working person, millionaire and tramp, ruler and ruled. </span></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Its Sabbath
day and Sabbath year secure, even to the lowliest, rest and leisure. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>With the blast of the Jubilee trumpets the slave goes
free, the debt
that cannot be paid is cancelled, and a re-division of the land
secures again to the poorest their fair share in the bounty of the
common Creator. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The reaper must leave something for the gleaner; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>even
the ox cannot be muzzled as he treadeth out the corn. 
    </small></li>
</ul>

Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
Land for the People</a> (1889 speech) <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... WHAT I ask you here tonight
is as far as you can to join in this
general movement and push on the cause. It is not a local matter, it
is a worldwide matter. It is not a matter than interests merely the
people of Ireland, the people of England and Scotland or of any other
country in particular, but it is a matter that interests the whole
world. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What we are battling for is
the freedom of mankind; what we
are struggling for is for the abolition of that industrial slavery
which as mud enslaves men as did chattel slavery. </span>It will not
take
the sword to win it. There is a power far stronger than the sword and
that is the power of public opinion. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When the masses of men know what
hurts them and how it can be cured when they know what to demand, and
to make their demand heard and felt, they will have it and no power
on earth can prevent them What enslaves men everywhere is ignorance
and prejudice.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>If we were to go to that island that we imagined, and if you
were
fools enough to admit that the land belonged to me, I would be your
master, and you would be my slaves just as thoroughly, just as
completely, as if I owned your bodies, for all I would have to do to
send you out of existence would be to say to you "get off my
property." That is the cause of the industrial slavery that exists
all over the world, that is the cause of the low wages, that is the
cause of the unemployed labor. <a

<p>  Henry George: <a href="../HG/debate_hyndman_1889.html">The Great
  Debate: Single Tax vs Social Democracy</a>&nbsp; (1889)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The interests of the people are
always in freedom. (Applause.) Let the people have their natural
rights; let them stand on an equal plane with regard to the
opportunities of nature, and then they will have a full, fair, and
free field. (Cheers.) Then if one is more active, more industrious,
more enterprising than another, then in God&#8217;s name let them go
ahead. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The notion of reducing everyone to
one level is a preposterous
notion; it is the notion of ancient Egypt, not of the 19th century.
This is the watchword: freedom, freedom, always freedom. To each the
fullest opportunity to develop his own powers; to all that which
belongs to all &#8211; that which God above has given to all equally
&#8211; that which the community, as distinguished from the
individual, produces. That is the doctrine of the Single Tax. (Great
applause.) ...&nbsp; <a href="../HG/debate_hyndman_1889.html"><span

    FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Q1. Do you regard the single tax as a panacea for all social disease?<br>
    A. When William Lloyd Garrison announced his conversion to the single tax
      in a letter to Henry George, he took pains to state that he did not believe
      it to be a panacea, and Mr. George replied : &quot;Neither do I; but I
      believe that freedom is.&quot; Your question may be answered in the same
      way. Freedom is the panacea for social wrongs and the ills they breed,
      and the single tax principle is the tap-root of freedom. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

<p>Judge Samuel Seabury: <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">An Address delivered
        upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
      We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
      which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
      men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
      contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed.</p>
  <p>... Henry George's teachings involved more than the prescription of specific
      remedies for particular evils. The specific remedies which he proposed
    were means to an end. The end was the philosophy of freedom as applied to
    human
      relations. I do not say that the majority of the people of the world have
    given acceptance to many of his most important teachings. Indeed, in view
    of the
      world tendency since his death to aggrandize the powers of the political
    state and limit and subordinate the power of the people, it is self-evident
    that
      in this environment the principles of Henry George could not have won general
      acceptance. Had they done so, the world would have made greater progress
    toward the attainment of the goal of human freedom and economic contentment
    which
      is still the unrealized aspiration of humanity. ...</p>
  <p>We must not delude ourselves with the belief that the great battle now going
      on between the dictatorships and the so-called democracies is merely a
    matter of the nominal form of government. It is not. The difference is much
    more fundamental.
      Opposing and diametrically opposite philosophies confront one another.
    The contest is between the philosophy of dictatorship and the philosophy
    of freedom.
      Irrespective of the name we give our form of government, or the method
    by which we choose its administrators, the philosophy of freedom cannot be
    realized
      unless the world recognizes the common rights of men in the resources of
    nature, unless it recognizes the right of every people to trade with other
    peoples,
      unless it safeguards the individual rights of life, liberty and property
    and unless it insures tolerance of opinion. These principles are the essential
      life-giving attributes of freedom: without them there can be no civilization
      in the sense in which that term is used by a free people. ...</p>
  <p>The modern world is so closely knit together by reason of the new inventions
      which have eliminated distance and made communication easy, that a world divided
      against itself cannot stand.</p>
  <p>The issue is vital to the welfare of mankind. The conclusion of the coming
      struggle cannot be forecast with certainty. Often before in the world's
    history, opposing and mutually destructive philosophies of life have clashed.
    One of
      these ways of life must prevail over the other. If the rule of despotism
    shall triumph by the use of modern armaments &#8212; and if it triumphs it can only
      be by resort to these agencies of destruction, because the rule of reason and
      justice is necessarily outlawed in every despotism &#8212; then the light
      of our civilization may be extinguished and mankind may for a long night
      relapse
      into barbarism.</p>
  <p>But if we shall be true to the philosophy of freedom; if we shall make our
      democracies in fact democratic, so that they shall express and recognize the
      principles of freedom, no dictatorship can prevail over us or destroy our civilization,
      and in this age of marvelous invention, with its capacity to produce wealth
      in abundance, force the people of the world to adopt a lower standard of economic
      social life.</p>
  <p>The most serious threat to democracy which exists is that the democracies
      themselves have not as yet achieved social justice for their own people. If
      they would achieve it, they would have nothing to fear from the dictatorship
      states. In this country we have approximately eleven million unemployed and
      are now in the tenth year of an acute economic depression. We certainly cannot
      claim to have achieved social justice. True, we offer many advantages over
      what the despotisms offer, but in any country people will submit to regimentation
      and political and social despotism rather than go without food and shelter.
      In such circumstances, ignorant of the value of the liberty they surrender,
      they will sell their birthright for a mess of pottage. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read
