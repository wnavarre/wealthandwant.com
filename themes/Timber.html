</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE
CASE OF FORESTRY</span> </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The inadequacy of surrogate
pollution
taxation is
exemplified by forestry.&nbsp; The main purposes of watershed
protection have long been to regulate water flows, to reduce flooding
and erosion, and sustain flows during droughts.&nbsp;</span> Minimizing
pesticide runoff is a worthy additional purpose, but not the sole
one.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Francisco Goya left hanging in The Prado two
paintings of his beloved, La Maja Desnuda and La Maja Vestida.&nbsp;
Some prefer the earthy Desnuda.&nbsp; When it comes to Mother Earth,
however, she looks better Vestida in virgin verdure or some renewable
replacement raiments.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gaia
theorists, indeed, regard the
biosphere as an integral part of the whole terrestrial organism.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">However you regard it, removing
it is
hazardous and
damaging to the children of Earth.&nbsp; Denuded land is the source of
almost all forest runoff problems.&nbsp;</span> Erosion results from a
combination of </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>logging roads (too many, too long, on land too steep); 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>clearcutting; and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>slow replanting.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Slow replanting is the central
problem.&nbsp; It
slows the supply of second&#8209;growth timber, and thus creates pressure to
invade submarginal areas.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Foresters
should harvest the low, flat,
warm lands early and often because: </span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>a) Regeneration is economical
there, it pays for itself where trees grow fast; <br>
b) Regeneration is
fastest there, minimizing the exposure period of bare land; <br>
c) Logging
roads may be shorter and less erosive there, because nearer to markets
and on level land; <br>
d) The temporary loss of scenic beauty is less
severe; <br>
e) The exposed bare land is less steep; <br>
f) Logging is cheaper
and less destructive; selective logging is more feasible; <br>
g) Fire
control is easier; <br>
h) Younger stands are more vigorous and naturally
resistant to pests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The last point bears underscoring here.&nbsp; It
points to how good forest management can minimize pest damage without
heavy reliance on toxics.&nbsp; The spruce budworm, for example, wreaks
damage mainly on trees weakened by age.&nbsp; To protect those older
trees, whole forests, millions of acres in the northeast are sprayed,
with tragic treadmill results.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>The tussock&#8209;moth, over which so much organochlorine
has been shed in the fir forests, damages trees mainly on poor growing
sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Trees on good
sites withstand defoliation, green up,
and grow with renewed vigor.&nbsp; The moral: stay off the poor
sites.&nbsp; The method: utilize the good sites fully.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why
aren't
the good sites harvested early, replanted
quickly, and utilized fully?&nbsp; One major reason lies in the tax
system.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">a.&nbsp;
Replanting cost is not expensable for
income tax, it must be capitalized, hence not written off until decades
later when timber is harvested.</span>&nbsp; Timber taxation was not
neglected, you may be sure, by Oregon Senator Packwood who shepherded
through our most recent tax reform; but timber lobbies have
deliberately traded this off to keep what they prize more, the capital
gains treatment of timber sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">b.&nbsp;
Most states have substituted the yield tax
for the property tax.</span>&nbsp; The result is a bias against early
harvesting.&nbsp; When you look at the whole system it also pushes
cutting pressure out to marginal lands.&nbsp; But a yield tax at a high
rate wholly destroys any incentive to restock marginal lands, once cut:
it makes them subeconomic to replant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">c.&nbsp;
Some states have virtually eliminated the
land value part of the property tax on timber, removing an incentive to
early reforestation.</span>&nbsp; A tax based on land value continues
at a
steady level during the sterile downtime of land between harvest and
replanting, thus pricking holders in the most compelling way to
restock, while not taxing them at all for actually restocking.&nbsp; On
marginal land the tax base is zero (it being based on land value) so it
does not cause abandonment, nor make replanting any less economic than
it already is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">d.&nbsp; When timber is standing
        the value added by growth is partly unrecognized as taxable income.&nbsp;</span> Timber
  has been
  a "capital asset" for income tax purposes since 1944.&nbsp; Not only is
  much of the gain unrecognized as income, but any tax is deferred until
  harvest.&nbsp; After timber is felled, value-added in the mills and
  markets is "ordinary" income and bears the full fury of the tax
  rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>&nbsp;When timber is standing
there is
no property tax, so
it need only grow fast enough to pay interest on its value.&nbsp; After
it is cut it must yield a rate of return high enough to cover a
property tax, too, not just on its stumpage value but also on the
value&#8209;added by harvesting, hauling, milling, shipping, storing,
merchandising, and constructing.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Thus the dual result of income and property taxes is
to defer harvest, increasing the volume of old, disease&#8209;prone timber
standing on good land, and pushing logging pressure out to marginal
lands.&nbsp; Many marginal lands are non&#8209;regenerable.&nbsp; Logging
there is simply mining, leaving La Tierra Desnuda and open to the
elements indefinitely.&nbsp; <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Forestry on public lands,
ironically, manifests
similar biases, from a different set of incentives.&nbsp; William Hyde,
Marion Clawson and others have documented the pattern: undermanagement
of superior sites accompanied by premature invasion of steep, remote
sites as the Forest Service internalizes all its profits from timber
sales to build more roads (and its empire).&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Both private and public forestry generate
specialists with information monopolies which they use to obscure these
issues and divert us with others.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">An
optimal
solution would constructively combine and
synthesize two apparently contrary concepts of land stewardship.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THESIS:
Concept A says "Conserve for the
future."&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ANTITHESIS: Concept B says
"Stewardship means
highest and best use."&nbsp;</span> Landholders are responsible to use
land
now, in order to employ others (generate incomes), to produce goods
(combat inflation), and pay taxes (avoid deficits).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SYNTHESIS: Concept AB says do both,
but in different
places.&nbsp; Use the good lands intensively, grow timber early and
often, thus relieve human pressure and help conserve the vulnerable,
erosive lands.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Until this is done, will optimal taxes on aerial
sprays do much good?&nbsp; Some good, no doubt.&nbsp; But the main
problems are deeper rooted and call for bolder measures.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>That is my basic message.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Forestry
suffers
from cutting sprawl, quite analogous to urban sprawl.&nbsp; The center
is neglected, so the action moves to submarginal fringes and damages
what's left of the center.</span>&nbsp; Let us now look at two more
cases,
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">urban
sprawl</span> itself, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">agricultural
sprawl</span>, where the source of
problems is analogous, and the implied solutions the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1955, Spiro Agnew was a
Maryland State Assemblyman on the
rise.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> He carried a new law that let
tax assessors value farmland on its
"use-value" as farmland, instead of market value. It let owners who
were farming for unearned increments around Baltimore and D.C. hold
out with low carrying costs.</span> "Farmland" meant land used for
farming,
and any play at farming would qualify. Under this law, a relative of
mine with 102 acres in Maryland near Western Avenue, the D.C. line,
kept just two steers thereon to validate his farmland assessment
status. Holding for the rise "never crossed his mind." Right --
except, whenever such land is condemned for public use, courts
everywhere have held that compensation must be based on speculative
market value.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><small></small>It is not just peri-urban land speculators who
gain. A large
chunk of land value in rural regions is not based on cash flow from
food and fiber, but on amenities. Wisconsin is a major playground
for rich urbanites from nearby Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and
St. Paul. "Use-value" assessment exempts this chunk of value
completely, for use-value is based on capitalizing the net cash farm
income from growing crops, and, in the Wisconsin law, specifically
corn. The highest land values per capita in the State are in Vilas
County up in the north woods, once dismissed as worthless "cutovers."
Vilas' barren podzol soils are worthless for corn, but sparkling
lakes bedizen the County. Values per capita in Vilas are 6 times
those in Milwaukee. Rich recreationists and "investors" (read
speculators) are gobbling up the "wild forties." Shoreline parcels
are like diamonds among coal. <strong>... </strong></small><small><small></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">100
years ago, American
Georgists made a big point that city land
outvalues rural land many times over. One implication is that
taxing city land is taxing the rich, and we can ignore farmland. </span>Some
land-taxers counsel that farmers are easily misled to oppose us,
so leave them alone and convert the cities. But rich city folks also
own choice rural lands.

the privately

(mostly
huge corporations) may put the land into the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">"TPZ"</span> class. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
standing timber is then exempt, and taxed only at harvest, at 2.9%,
much too low a rate to make up for a 60-year lifetime of exemption.</span>
County assessors have to value the land separately on its putative
value for growing timber, following a State-legislated formula that
is tailored drastically to understate even that low value (California
Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Much
of that land, though, has
alternative uses, e.g. for retirement and vacation homes and resorts,

rights of way, lumber camps, loading sites, water sources, lakes, log
storage, landings - there are many things to do with 1/3 of a
nation's land. <span

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Timber and Timberland
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Standing timber is generally now
exempt from property taxes, by
law or custom. Land remains on the property tax rolls. This sounds
like a Georgist idea; advocate Ellis Williams, a forest economist,
has made the point. It is, however, just partial and discriminatory
Georgism. The present system works as though you exempted half the
buildings in a city from a tax and raised the rate on the others.
Timber is exempt, but as soon as it is cut, milled, and hammered into
buildings, it goes on the property tax rolls. The bias is apparent
between capital in different forms.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standing
timber still yields some revenue when it is cut. The idea
has been to substitute a "yield-tax" for the property tax. </span>In
practice, though, yield tax rates are much too low to be
revenue-neutral. In California, for example, the yield tax rate is
2.9 percent. It is levied just once during the tree's life cycle of
60-100 years, at the end. Two and nine-tenths percent levied just
once at the end of each 60 years, is obviously less than one percent
levied every year, starting from year one. Values are low in the
sapling years, but well above zero, and in the last few years before
harvest, the stumpage is worth nearly as much as its harvest value. I
have calculated that a yield tax of 25 percent or so (varying with
the interest rate and the tree-life) is needed to have the same
present value as a one percent property tax.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is the revenue result in one
major California timber county,
Mendocino. Its major property value is timber, but the County
government and its subdivisions hardly get dried beans from the yield
tax on it: $3.9 million in 1993, compared to $45 million from all
property. This is not because they are cutting timber slowly;
actually they are depleting the inventory. Neither is it because
other values are high. This County has no large cities. Most of its
people live outside the cities, and its annual timber harvest is
twice as high as the sum of all its other "agricultural" gross output
(including fishing). The net cash flow from timber harvests is much
more than twice as high as the net cash flow from other property,
because stumpage value is added mainly by property (land and trees),
while other farm products like grapes, fruits, and milk are more
labor-using.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How about land under the timber?
It is separately valued, and kept
on the property tax rolls. However, it yields revenue of only $1.2
million: one-third of what the yield tax renders.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Why so little? They could raise
the valuation of timber land to
compensate for exempting the trees. In addition, "timberland" in some
areas is sold for vacation homes and resorts. Assessors once began
using those sales to justify higher valuations. They also observed
smaller timberland owners paying higher unit prices than giant
corporate owners, and up-valued parts of their vast spreads
accordingly.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Timber owners had other ideas,
however. Major owners like SP
(520,000 acres of timber in California) took alarm and went to
Sacramento for relief. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They
got their lands put in a "</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Timber Preserve
Zone" (TPZ)</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> wherein
land is assessed only on its putative value for
raising timber, regardless of market value, regardless of alternative
uses, and regardless of nontimber income from land growing timber.
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">These
"compatible" (untaxed) uses include grazing, resorts, vacation
homes, campsites, fishing, hunting, watershed protection, tourism,
rifle ranges, rights-of-way, mining, log storage, landings, roads,
logging camps, etc. There is also hemp for the drug trade: possibly
the state's most valuable farm crop, but unrecorded.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">TPZ
is hardly known outside the timber counties, but it covers
vastly more than the better-known "Williamson Act" which provides for
preferential low assessment of farmland.</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> In Mendocino County, TPZ
land of medium grade ("Site III") is now tax assessed at $136/acre.
This is about ten percent of its value for growing timber</span>
(disregarding compatible uses), and a lesser fraction of its value
for higher-valued "incompatible" uses like retirement homes that
require formal "conversion" (obtainable on demand) out of TPZ. This
is how they keep the tax payments on TPZ land down to only $1.2
million.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Role of
Timber and Timberland </b>
</small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mendocino County</span>,
lying on
the north coast, is redwood countty.
Redwood's value on the stump ("stumpage") this year is <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">53 cents</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">per
board foot (pbf) </span>when mature. In <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Shasta County</span>, timber
stumpage is
worth about half that, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">28
cents pbf,</span> and is heavily logged at that
value -- Shasta is our second biggest producer. If it is worth logging
great volumes of Shasta timber to get 28 cents pbf, then there is a
lot of surplus in Mendocino timber at 53 cents pbf. This surplus is
what makes this land so valuable for growing timber. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This surplus,
unvexed by taxation, is what makes these lands so attractive to, and
the play-things of corporate raiders, merger specialists,
speculators, arbitrageurs, lawyers, and junk-bond salesman living
thousands of miles away.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Redwood is a faster-growing
species than most western timber
(although much slower than Yellow Pine in the southeastern states).
An acre of good (Site II) Mendocino land will yield a crop of 40,000
bf after 60 years of growth, worth about $20,000 on the stump at the
1995 prices. Discounting that to the present, using a real interest
rate of five percent, means dividing it by about 16. Add ten percent
for the present value of all harvests after 60 years, and you have
very roughly $1,400/acre for the land value based purely on timber
culture, considering no other values. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet
under TPZ its assessed tax
value is $158, about 11 percent of its true value just for timber
culture.</span> This is accomplished by legislating the actual acre
values
(California Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). The legislated
formula mandates that "income-based" assessments be based on past
prices, projected into the far future with no adjustments for
inflation, but discounted at a high interest rate. It is clear for
whose benefit this law was framed. ...</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Timberland owners around the
country have sold this bill of goods
to legislators. In many states, less than half the private land is
fully taxable, because of such laws. These are not all western or
southern states, either, as one might surmise. In NH, for example,
only 45 percent of the private land (and none of the Federal land) is
fully taxable. The rest is sheltered by the State's "Current Use" tax
law, their version of our TPZ law.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Advocates for these laws argue
that land taxes, accumulating with
interest over long growth periods, would eat up all the profit from
growing timber. Let us see. Taxes of $1.56 per acre per year,
accumulating over 60 years at a real interest rate of five percent,
come to $552 per acre in constant 1995 dollars. At that time the
timber stumpage will be worth about $20,000 at 1995 prices, or 36
times the accumulated future value of the land taxes. (In addition,
the investment will have served to shield the owners from the eroding
effects of inflation, a benefit assumed away by using constant
dollars. On top of that, it is a good bet the real value of timber
will have risen after 60 years of population growth.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, land taxes would have to be
36 times what they are now to
consume the whole value of timber harvests. The fact is, present
taxes are a negligible token. Timberland is effectively sheltered
from the full weight (light as it is) of the one percent property tax
imposed on ordinary land. It pays, as we have seen, only about $1.2
million a year in Mendocino County.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Timberland owners around the
country have sold this bill of goods
to legislators. In many states, less than half the private land is
fully taxable, because of such laws. These are not all western or

only 45 percent of the private land (and none of the Federal land) is
fully taxable. The rest is sheltered by the State's "Current Use" tax
law, their version of our TPZ law.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The acre value of timberland is
low compared with downtown values
in San Francisco, where one little square foot in the hottest spot
may fetch $2,000. That is $87 million per acre! However, there are
very few such golden acres, compared to a million acres of timberland
in Mendocino County, some 35 million acres in California, and 737
million acres in the U.s. That is 32 percent of the area of the 50
states. (The fraction of private and public land in forests is, by
coincidence, the same: 32 percent.)</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Owing to the success of timber
people in spreading their gospel,
almost all of their land is underassessed. Almost all state yield
taxes, imposed in lieu of property taxes on standing timber, are too
low to be revenue-neutral. Add to that, Congress since 1943 has made
timber a "capital asset" for federal (and therefore state) income
tax. Many costs of managing and carrying this capital asset are
expensible - certainly interest and property taxes are. The net
result is that timberland contributes very little to public revenues
at any level.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Residents of timber counties are
typically scattered and poorly
organized. Timber companies are huge, rich, few and tightly
organized. In Mendocino County, Georgia Pacific and Louisiana
Pacific, absentee owners, together own the best 500,000 acres - 58
percent of the County's timberland - and Georgia-Pacific owns
Louisiana-Pacific. They control state forestry schools, paying
professors as consultants. They support research in forest economics
at think tanks like Resources for the Future in Washington, which has
never criticized their tax preferences but trained its big guns on
public agencies, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management. "The industry" controls tax laws in 50 states, and
sloughs tax burdens onto others. It will continue to do so until
other taxpayers in the timber counties wake up and organize to
control state timber tax laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><span

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Priority #4. What
Tax to Fight First?</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We must set priorities on taxes to
lower and eliminate. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Georgist [geoist] objective is dual: to raise taxes on land,
and to lower taxes on other bases.</span> Many Georgists have the
posture
and mindset of reforming just "the property tax," in a vacuum, but
this was never George's main point. There are other new or augmented
taxes more damaging and noxious than the property tax falling on
reproducible wealth: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>state taxes on retail sales; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>payroll taxes; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>income taxes falling on wages and salaries; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>excise taxes; etc.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some
Georgists have supporting wiping out taxes on "personal"
(movable) property. </span>Political success be the test, this
movement has
won massively (although silently) in state after state, and in all
Canadian provinces. The result, though, is to do as much harm as
good, for the exemption of capital is partial and discriminatory.
"Real" (immovable) capital is still taxed, biasing the way investors
allocate capital. Indeed, some "real" property is changed into
"personal" property simply by unbolting it from the floor.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result is also regressive,
because personal property in most
industries is more concentrated in ownership than real capital. In
farming, for example, personal property includes cattle, stored
grain, and farm machinery, but the owner's dwelling is real
capital.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other
Georgists have diverted their efforts into wiping out the
property tax on standing timber, replacing it with a nominal yield
tax.</span> Again, the result is partial and discriminatory, biasing
investors to allocate more capital in the form of timber, and
correspondingly less in other forms. As noted earlier, the present
system works as though half the buildings in a city are exempted from
a tax and the rate on the others raised.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Timber-exemption is highly
regressive because the ownership of
timber is much more concentrated than the ownership of homes of
loggers and mill-workers and retirees in the timber counties. It
would not be so bad if the land taxes on timber-growing sites were
raised enough to compensate for exempting the growing stock. However,
as we have shown, these site taxes are also held down to token
levels. The net result is to turn timber and timberland owners into a
huge public welfare case supported by a sophisticated brainwashing
machinery paid by the discretionary income and wealth of the
industry. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PTBaR.html"><span

Institutions acquire land for their operations and then it tends to
stick to them for various reasons. It is tax free, for one, so long as
they retain it (and do not use it commercially). They are not subject
to corporate raids. Thus there is no mechanism whereby the current
opportunity cost of land is felt by management. It never appears in
their budgets; they never need compete for or justify it. College
Boards are not accountable to any public body, a precedent set by
Marshall's U.S. Supreme Court in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819.</small>

Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax Crusade</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A University of Alabama School of Law Professor has asked God's forgiveness
    for the years she lived in the sin of ignorance about tax injustice. Susan
    Pace Hamill, a tax expert, business consultant, and dedicated United Methodist
    church goer, thought there was a misprint when she first read that personal
    incomes as low as $4,600 for a family of four were being taxed by the state,
    while timber owners holding 71% of the land of Alabama were paying less than
    $1 per acre in property taxes. Two hours later she found out there had been
    no mistake and that Alabama has the most regressive tax code in the country.
    Her righteous rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated onto the national
    scene.<br>
        <br>
"As somebody who knows a lot about taxes, I could not have imagined a design
of a tax structure this bad," she said in a <em>Tuscaloosa News</em>story last
February. "The state's tax code is really horribly unjust and has no moral, ethical
leg to stand on. Period."<br>
      <br>
    Alabamians with incomes under $13,000 pay 10.9 percent of their incomes in
    state and local taxes while those who make over $229,000 pay just 4.1 percent.
    Commercial property owners pay more than 50 percent of property taxes, with
    homes approaching one-third. Alabama's sales taxes are among the highest
    in the nation, up to 10 percent in some areas, and do not exempt even the
    most basic necessities such as food. The state's 1901 constitution was written
    primarily by large landholders to secure their economic interests, consequently
    property taxes are extremely light on their holdings. ... <a href="docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>

an Oregon timber

interlocking stock holding; the huge corporations holding resources
would have other profitable lines to turn to.<br>

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 3: The Limits of Government (pages 33-48)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    Limits of Public Ownership</p>
  <p>Because of historical circumstances, America has a long tradition of public
    land ownership. When Europeans first arrived, North America was held in common
    by an assortment of tribes. As these tribes were dispossessed, the federal
    government acquired their territories. Some of the federal holdings were
    given to states as they entered the union. Though most of what the federal
    and state governments owned was then sold cheaply, much was retained. Today,
    nearly a third of the land in the United States is government-owned.</p>
  <p>To say that land &#8212; or any asset &#8212; is &#8220;government-owned,&#8221; however,
    isn&#8217;t to say it&#8217;s managed on behalf of future generations, nonhuman
    species, or ordinary citizens. Consider what the federal and state governments
    have done with the lands they own.</p>
  <p>Outside of Alaska, about 5 percent of government-owned lands have been designated
    as wilderness. In such areas, humans may enter on foot but not use motorized
    vehicles. Mining, logging, and hunting are also prohibited. On the other
    95 percent of government-owned land, private and commercial use is regulated
    by various agencies.<strong> National forests are managed by the U.S. Forest Service,
    grazing and mineral lands by the Bureau of Land Management, hunting and fishing
    by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>As a general rule, politics &#8212; not fiduciary duty &#8212; determines
    what uses are permitted and what prices are charged. </strong>A classic example is
    the Mining Act of 1872, under which private companies can stake claims to
    mineral-bearing lands for $5 an acre, and pay no royalties on the minerals
    they extract. Every attempt to reform this antiquated law has failed because
    of the mining companies&#8217; political clout.</p>
  <p><strong>In the same vein, the U.S. Forest Service has for decades been selling
      trees to timber companies for below-market prices. On top of that, it spends
      billions
    of tax dollars building roads in virgin forests so timber firms can harvest
    the people&#8217;s trees. This is, of course, economically irrational and
    a huge subsidy to private corporations. It also addicts Americans to cheap
    forest products and destructive logging methods. These practices occur because
    the Forest Service is not a trust committed to ecosystem preservation, but
    a politically influenced agency dedicated to &#8220;multiple use&#8221; of
    government-owned forests.</strong></p>
  <p>There are exceptions to this dismal pattern. One involves trust lands given
    by the federal government to states. Such gifts began with the Land Ordinance
    of 1785, which reserved one square mile per township for the support of public
    schools. Later, the Morrill Land Grant College Act of 1862 gave more land
    to states to support colleges of agriculture and mechanics. And in 1954,
    Congress gave Texas title to oil-rich coastal lands, providing that all revenue
    from them be placed in an endowment, or permanent fund, that generates income
    for public schools forever.</p>
  <p>Today, twenty-two states hold about 155 million acres in trust for public
    schools and colleges &#8212; which is to say, for future generations. <strong>Like
    the federal government, the state trusts lease much of their land for oil
    drilling, timber cutting, and cattle grazing. The trusts&#8217; duty is to
    preserve not the land itself but the income streams it generates. </strong>This creates
    beneficiaries (educators, students, parents) who monitor the land managers
    closely. One result, according to University of California professor Sally
    Fairfax, is that state trust lands are better managed than federally owned
    lands. Whereas the U.S. Forest Service &#8220;has been hiding the ball on
    cash flows and returns to investments for most of this century . . . the
    state trust land managers know how to keep books and make them public.&#8221; Further,
    even though the state trusts aren&#8217;t bound to protect ecosystems per
    se, they tend to do so because they have a long-term calculus.</p>
  <p>An interesting variant of the typical state land trust is the Alaska Permanent
    Fund, created in 1976 to absorb some of the windfall from leasing state land
    to oil companies. The aim was to create an endowment that would benefit Alaskans
    even after the oil is gone. To this end, the Permanent Fund invests in stocks,
    bonds, and similar assets, and off the earnings pays yearly dividends to
    every resident. Originally, the dividends were to be allocated in proportion
    to the recipients&#8217; length of residence in Alaska, with old-timers getting
    more than newcomers. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, because of the
    Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Alaska couldn&#8217;t
    discriminate against newcomers that way. The dividend formula was then changed
    to one person, one share. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
