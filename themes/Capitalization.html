  <p>Just as when interest rates rise, housing prices tend to go down, a tax on
      land values will tend to bring down the purchase price of land. (A tax on building
      values will have very different effects, because more houses can be created;
      a tax on buildings will dampen the demand for buildings, and discourage people
      from maintaining existing ones.)</p>

Here, let us say, is a lot on

of $10,000. Such a lot would now command a selling price of some
$250,000. An increased tax upon Land Values would not reduce its rental
value, except as it might have an effect in forcing into use unoccupied
land at a greater distance from the center of the city. But as less of
this rental value could be retained by the owner, the selling price
would be diminished. And if a tax on Land Values could be imposed with
such theoretical perfection that the whole rental value would be taken
by the community, the owner would lose both his income from its present
value and any expectation of profit from its future increase in value.
While it would be still worth as much as before to the user, it would
be worth nothing at all to the mere owner. Instead of having a selling
value of $250,000, it would not sell for anything, since what the user
paid for the privilege of using it would go in full to the community.
Under a tax of this kind, even though it could not be imposed with
theoretical nicety, the mere owner of land would disappear. No one
would care to own land unless he wanted to improve or use it. ...<a

<p>Charles B. Fillebrown: <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">A Catechism
    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q7. What is meant by land value?</em><br>
A. Its site value -- its selling or market value -- its net value to the purchaser
  -- the capitalization of its net rent -- the value supposed to be adopted by
  the assessors as the basis of taxation.</p>
  <p><em>Q10. What is the distinction between the taxation of land and the taxation
      of rent?</em><br>
A. Taxing land means, in the ordinary use of the words, to tax the land upon
its capital value, or selling value, at a given rate per $100 or $1,000 of that
value. Taxing rent means taxing the annual value, or ground rent, at a given
percentage of that rent. It is in one case a tax on rent; in the other is a tax
on capitalized rent.</p>
  <p><em>Q21. What is meant by an &quot;old tax&quot; or a &quot;new tax&quot;?</em><br>
    A. By the term &quot;old tax&quot; is intended the taxing force at last change
    of ownership; by a &quot;new tax,&quot; one the imposed since then.</p>
  <p><em>Q38. What are the three legs of the tripos, the threefold support upon
      which the single tax rests?</em><br>
A. They are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) The social origin of ground rent -- that the site value of land is
      a creation of the community, a public or social value.<br>
    (2) The non-shiftability of a land tax -- that no tax, new or old, on the
    site value of land can be recovered from the tenant or user by raising his
    rent.<br>
    (3) The ultimate burdenlessness of a land tax -- that the selling value of
    land, reduced as it is by the capitalized tax that is imposed upon it, is
    an untaxed value. Whatever lowers the income from land lowers proportionately
    its selling price, so that whether the established tax upon it has been light
    or heavy, it is no burden upon the new purchaser, who buys it at its net
    value and thus escapes all part in the tax burden which he should in justice
    share with those who now bear it all.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>Q40. What is meant by a capitalized tax?</em><br>
    A. It is a sum, the interest of which would pay the tax.</p>
  <p><em>Q49. What is the lesson of the inevitable &quot;capitalization&quot; of
    the land tax?</em><br>
    A. It is that an unfair discrimination in favor of the landowner can never
    be overcome until all taxes are paid out of ground rent; then all men will
    enjoy total exemption equally with the landowner. ... <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Fred Foldvary: <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><a
 href="../docs/Foldvary_Geo-Rent.html">Geo-Rent:
    A Plea to Public Economists</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The textbooks and mainstream
journals recognize the idea of
capitalization. Indeed, there is a great deal of literature about land
prices reflecting the schools, infrastructure, and security in the
neighborhood. But, again, the understanding is often compartmentalized;
the insight is rarely applied in thinking about efficient forms of
taxation and governance. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Public
economists rarely point out how the
idea of capitalization favors geo-rent taxation: If local government
taxes geo-rent, and it uses that money to provide infrastructure and
security, it further enhances geo-rent, thus recouping some of its
investment.</span> If local government claims 50 percent of geo-rent,
it has
an incentive to enhance geo-rent. It is the half residual claimant. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
arrangement is healthy, because government&#8217;s local works directly
affect the magnitude of geo-rent. The government&#8217;s residual claimancy
gives it an incentive to produce social benefits.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This government-as-improver process parallels capitalization as
the
basis for the private provision of collective goods, such as the common
elements of condominiums financed by the periodic assessment of the
owners. Private communities and condominiums demonstrate the connection
between residual claimancy and capitalization.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land values in many parts of
the United States are very high, and one
reason is supply-side restrictions. But much of the value reflects the
capitalization of amenities. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Today, government works are
financed in
large part by taxes on labor, profits, sales, and non-land real estate.
The owners of land receive an implicit subsidy. </span>This implicit
subsidy
is of great empirical importance, yet is not discussed in
microeconomics textbooks, and is usually ignored in the tax analysis in
public finance. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<blockquote>
  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">99. &quot;Whatever dispute arouses the passions of men,
        the conflict is sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it wise?'
        as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an
        ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind; it
        rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably the
        deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that alone
        is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual actions
        and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider
        field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
        material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212; Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country have
        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is
        truthfully described in &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch.
        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard
          in search of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without
          paying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink,
          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress

  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.

        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without

  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive

  <p> If that were done it is doubtful if land-owners could any longer confiscate
    enough Rent to be worth the trouble. Even though some surplus were still
    kept by them, it would be so much more easy to secure Wealth by working for
    it than by confiscating Rent to private use, to say nothing of its being
    so much more respectable, that speculation in land values would practically
    be abandoned. At any rate, the question of a surplus &#8212; Rent in excess
    of the requirements of the community &#8212; may be readily determined when
    the principle that Rent justly belongs to the community and Wages to the

<small>Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are
capitalized. For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have
an imputed or expected income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of
capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad valorem" tax would reduce the
imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax would naturally reduce the

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The one kind of tax where there
is no deadweight loss whatsoever is
that imposed upon an base with inelastic supply. Since land and some
other elements of nature cannot be increased in quantity resulting in a
completely vertical supply curve, no inefficiency is incurred by such a
tax. Consider two cases of a tax commonly found worldwide on real
estate. Because a real property tax is actually two taxes from the
standpoint of economic dynamics -- the tax on the land component and
the tax on the improvement component, each is considered here as a
separate case. In the first case, the tax on the land component alone
is illustrated. In the other case, the tax on the improvement component
(i.e. the building) is shown. What happens?</small><br>
<br>
<small>The tax on land alone is completely capitalized in the market
value of
the land parcel and is not passed forward to the tenant. This is
important, because when the roughly 1/3 of all American households that
rent rather than own their own homes are removed from the burden of
property taxation, it has the effect of making the land tax far more
progressive. Those land parcels that do pay taxes are split between
residential and non-residential titleholders. Even though the
residential households are likely to constitute the overwhelming number
of parcels in the tax base, they are likely to bear only about half the
taxes paid, the remaining share borne largely by commercial sites.
Agricultural parcels may in some instances represent a large area of
land, but it is likely to be of far lower market value and represent
less than five percent of the revenue paid. The land component of a tax
on real property then is actually highly progressive.... <a

  Land Speculation</a> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gaffney (1961, 1973) has suggested an additional reason why taxing land
      will improve the efficiency of land development decisions: It mitigates friction
      in the lending market. Land, he says, is an investment that commends itself
      to investors with low discount rates and high opportunity costs of their
      time. It requires little attention; unlike investments in on-going enterprises,
      land is unlikely to fall greatly in value as a consequence of neglect. Potential
      users of land, on the other hand, tend to be people who have above-average
      discount rates. Because of the combination of differing capacities of borrowers
      to offer collateral and the difficulties in identifying borrowers who will
      be good risks, an equilibrium can persist in which competing bidders for
      land have quite divergent discount rates. In such circumstances, the taxation
      of land ameliorates the variation in discount rates. <strong>The capitalization
      of land taxes into lower purchase prices constitutes a substitution of
      a recurring
      annual charge for a one-time charge. This makes land relatively more attractive
      to people with high discount rates, and relatively less attractive to people
      with low discount rates, shifting land out of the hands of people who will
      tend to leave it idle and into the hands of people who will tend to develop
      it. </strong>Since this circumvents friction in the lending market, the consequent
    earlier development of land is more efficient. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read the whole article</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles.
      Locations are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are
      improved or not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others
      elsewhere,32 a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles
      of sound tax theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however,
      when looking at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
      The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
      as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
      the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
      of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
      data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
      of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
      allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
      Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
      reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
      easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
      features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through
      local or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas
      of greatest market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can
      easily be taxed in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a
      stock. Just as income is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and
      should) be understood as such.</p>
    <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
      what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
      than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
      since. <strong>He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended
      by human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates
      to
      land. Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic
      location for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use.
      Regardless whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the
      full extent of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate
      with their full capacity.</strong> This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century
      ago observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without
      working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising
      as it does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the
      community and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent
      its recovery by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to
      opportunistically situated titleholders. <strong>When offered for sale,
      the projected rental value is capitalized in the present value for purposes
      of attaching
      a market price and sold as a commodity.</strong> Yet simple justice calls for the
      recovery in taxes what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the
      failure to recover the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary
      to tax productive activities in our economy, and this leads to economic
      and technical inefficiency known as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It
      means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
    <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production
      not created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or
      sell as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century
      earlier, &#8220;The earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It
      is] given as a common stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This
      passage likely needs a bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct,
      understood since Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the
      right to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
      Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
      allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
      the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
      who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we
      do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
      presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
      that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
      ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
    <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent
      that derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not
      a large logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that
      rent should be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument:
      that the recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
      of taxation.38 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>
