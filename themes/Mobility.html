of Wealth Harm America</small></a><a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/debate_hyndman_1889.html"><small>
(excerpt from <span style="font-style: italic;">Social Problems)</span>&nbsp;
</small></a><small>(1883)</small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Can Anyone Be Rich?</b>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>The comfortable theory that it is in the nature of things that
some should be poor and some should be rich, and that the gross and
constantly increasing inequalities in the distribution of wealth
imply no fault in our institutions, pervades our literature, and is
taught in the press, in the church, in school and in college. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This is a free country, we are
told -- every man has a vote and
every man has a chance. The laborer's son may become President; poor
boys of to-day will be millionaires thirty or forty years from now,
and the millionaire's grandchildren will probably be poor. What more
can be asked? If a man has energy, industry, prudence and foresight,
he may win his way to great wealth. If he has not the ability to do
this he must not complain of those who have. If some enjoy much and
do little, it is because they, or their parents, possessed superior
qualities which enabled, them to "acquire property" or "make money."
If others must work hard and get little, it is because they have not
yet got their start, because they are ignorant, shiftless, unwilling
to practise that economy necessary for the first accumulation of
capital; or because their fathers were wanting in these respects. The
inequalities in condition result from the inequalities of human
nature, from the difference in the powers and capacities of different
men. If one has to toil ten or twelve hours a day for a few hundred
dollars a year, while another, doing little or no hard work, gets an
income of many thousands, it is because all that the former
contributes to the augmentation of the common stock of wealth is
little more than the mere force of his muscles. He can expect little
more than the animal, because he brings into play little more than
animal powers. He is but a private in the ranks of the great army of
industry, who has but to stand still or march, as he is bid. The
other is the organizer, the general, who guides and wields the whole
great machine, who must think, plan and provide; and his larger
income is only commensurate with the far higher and rarer powers
which he exercises, and the far greater importance of the function he
fulfils. Shall not education have its reward, and skill its payment?
What incentive would there be to the toil needed to learn to do
anything well were great prizes not to be gained by those who learn
to excel? It would not merely be gross injustice to refuse a Raphael
or a Rubens more than a housepainter, but it would prevent the
development of great painters. To destroy inequalities in condition
would be to destroy the incentive to progress. To quarrel with them
is to quarrel with the laws of nature. We might as well rail against
the length of the days or the phases of the moon; complain that there
are valleys and mountains; zones of tropical heat and regions of
eternal ice. And were we by violent measures to divide wealth
equally, we should accomplish nothing but harm; in a little while
there would be inequalities as great as before. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This, in substance, is the
teaching which we constantly hear.
It is accepted by some because it is flattering to their vanity, in
accordance with their interests or pleasing to their hope; by others,
because it is dinned into their ears. Like all false theories that
obtain wide acceptance, it contains much truth. But it is truth
isolated from other truth or alloyed with falsehood.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly
making their way from the
ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the ranks of those
who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state of things
right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that
piracy was right and that no effort should be made to suppress
it.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I am not denouncing the rich,
nor seeking, by speaking of
these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get a clear
understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that it
is due </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>to monopolies which we permit and create, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>to advantages which
we give one man over another, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>to methods of extortion sanctioned by
law and by public opinion, 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>that some men are enabled to get
so
enormously rich while others remain so miserably poor. I<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">f we look
around us and note the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation
which go to the building up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see
on the one hand now disingenuous are those who preach to us that
there is nothing wrong in social relations and that the inequalities
in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities of human
nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk as
though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
restricting the acquisition of wealth. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital
is a good; the
capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely
let any one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in
doing so.</span></span> There are deep wrongs in the present
constitution of society,
but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in
those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are
the laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from
bad
adjustments which it is within our power to amend. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The ideal social
state is not that in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but
in which each gets in proportion to his contribution to the general
stock. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">And in such a social
state there would not be less incentive
to exertion than now; there would be far more incentive.</span> Men
will be
more industrious and more moral, better workmen and better citizens,
if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his family, than
where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them until
some have far more than they could have earned, and others have
little or nothing.
