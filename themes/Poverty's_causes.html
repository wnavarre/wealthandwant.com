</span>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Twice a week, I receive an e-mail from
    an institute at a major (&quot;public ivy&quot;) university devoted to poverty
    research.&nbsp;
    It provides links to articles in newspapers all over the U.S. about the
    effects of poverty and various attempts to ease its effects,
    particularly on children.&nbsp; I search it in vain for any awareness
    that poverty is largely caused by how we structure our economy &#8212; the
    privatization of land value and natural resources.&nbsp; All the little bandages
    our society thinks to apply to try to reduce poverty's <span style="font-style: italic;">effects
    </span>are far less effective than striking at the root of
    poverty.&nbsp; But then again, maybe a major university &#8212; public or
    private &#8212; wouldn't
    want to be caught rocking the boat. Their funding could be hurt. (See Upton
    Sinclair.)</p>
  <p>And if we can't correctly and accurately identify the causes of poverty,
    the measures we adopt to reduce it are doomed to fail.</p>

        <p>          Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
          of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)</p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a cause for this
      poverty; and, if you trace it down, you will find its root in a primary
      injustice. Look over the world today &#8212; poverty everywhere. The cause must
      be a common one. You cannot attribute it to the tariff, or to the form
      of government, or to this thing or to that in which nations differ;
      because, as deep poverty is common to them all the cause that produces
      it must be a common cause. What is that common cause? T<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">here is one sufficient cause that is common
      to all nations; and that is the appropriation as the property of some
      of that natural element on which and from which all must live.</span>
      ...</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>&nbsp;Why, look all over this country &#8212; look at this town or any
      other town. If men only took what they wanted to use we should all have
      enough; but they take what they do not want to use at all. Here are a
      lot of Englishmen coming over here and getting titles to our land in
      vast tracts; what do they want with our land? They do not want it at
      all; it is not the land they want; they have no use for American land.
      What they want is the income that they know they can in a little while
      get from it. Where does that income come from? It comes from labour,
      from the labour of American citizens. What we are selling to these
      people is our children, not land.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Poverty! Can there be any doubt of its cause? Go, into the old
      countries &#8212; go into western Ireland, into the highlands of Scotland &#8212;
      these are purely primitive communities. There you will find people as
      poor as poor can be &#8212; living year after year on oatmeal or on potatoes,
      and often going hungry. I could tell you many a pathetic story.
      Speaking to a Scottish physician who was telling me how this diet was
      inducing among these people a disease similar to that which from the
      same cause is ravaging Italy (the Pellagra), I said to him: "There is
      plenty of fish; why don't they catch fish? There is plenty of game; I
      know the laws are against it, but cannot they take it on the sly?"
"That," he said, "never enters their heads. Why, if a man was even
      suspected of having a taste for trout or grouse he would have to leave
      at once."</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>There is no difficulty in discovering what makes those people
      poor. They have no right to anything that nature gives them. All they
      can make above a living they must pay to the landlord. They not only
      have to pay for the land that they use, but they have to pay for the
      seaweed that comes ashore and for the turf they dig from the bogs. They
      dare not improve, for any improvements they make are made an excuse for
      putting up the rent. These people who work hard live in hovels, and the
      landlords, who do not work at all &#8212; oh! they live in luxury in London or
      Paris. If they have hunting boxes there, why they are magnificent
      castles as compared with the hovels in which the men live who do the
      work. Is there any question as to the cause of poverty there?</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Now go into the cities and what do you see! Why, you see even a
      lower depth of poverty; aye, if I would point out the worst of the
      evils of land monopoly I would not take you to Connemara; I would not
      take you to Skye or Kintire &#8212; I would take you to Dublin or Glasgow or
      London. There is something worse than physical deprivation, something
      worse than starvation; and that is the degradation of the mind, the
      death of the soul. That is what you will find in those cities.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Now, what is the cause of that? Why, it is plainly to be seen;
      the people driven off the land in the country are driven into the slums
      of the cities. For every man that is driven off the land the demand for
      the produce of the workmen of the cities is lessened; and the man
      himself with his wife and children, is forced among those workmen to
      compete upon any terms for a bare living and force wages down. Get work
      he must or starve &#8212; get work he must or do that which those people, so
      long as they maintain their manly feelings, dread more than death, go
      to the alms-houses. That is the reason, here as in Great Britain, that
      the cities are overcrowded. Open the land that is locked up, that is
      held by dogs in the manger, who will not use it themselves and will not
      allow anybody else to use it, and you would see no more of tramps and
      hear no more of over-production.&nbsp; ... <a

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought this
        question:</div>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">&quot;Suppose there should arise from the
              English Channel or the German Ocean a no man's land on which common
        labor to an unlimited amount should be able
                to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated
              and of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large
        a part of English
                soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</div>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
        to thirty shillings a day.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
          would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall;
        and if he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would
        happen without
          any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural
        opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry being much changed;
        only that kind of
          production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord
        together less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great
        rise in wages
          would be at the expense of rent.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
        has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little
        village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the
        railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light
        of the candle;
        it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously
        multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be
        any higher?&quot;</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any
      higher; will it be easier for a man who has nothing but his labor to make
      an independent living?&quot;</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common
          labor will not be any higher; on the contrary, all the chances are
        that they will be lower; it will not be
            easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances
          are that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself
      a piece of ground, and hold possession.&quot;</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take
        his advice, you need do nothing more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe;
        you may lie around like the lazzaroni
          of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down
        a hole in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding
        one iota
          to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the
        new city you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings
        will be an
          almshouse. </p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
        That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
        to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all the fruits
        of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. ...</div>

        <p>...For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which he
          must draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be
          applied
          for the
          supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot
          be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature
          utilized, without
          the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it we
          live, to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as
          is the blade of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man
          all that belongs
          to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. <strong>Material progress
          cannot rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power
          of producing
          wealth from land; and hence,<em> when land is monopolized</em>, it
          might go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving the condition
          of
          those who have but their labor. </strong>It can but add to the value
          of land and the power which its possession gives. Everywhere, in all
          times, among
          all peoples, the possession of land is the base of aristocracy, the

      way we are treating this continent.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>That is the reason why people are huddled together in tenement
      houses; that is the reason why work is difficult to get; the reason
      that there seems, even in good times, a surplus of labor, and that in
      those times that we call bad, the times of industrial depression, there
      are all over the country thousands and hundreds of thousands of men
      tramping from place to place, unable to find employment.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Not work enough! Why, what is work? Productive work is simply
      the application of human labor to land, it is simply the transforming,
      into shapes adapted to gratify human desires, of the raw material that
      the Creator has placed here. Is there not opportunity enough for work
      in this country? Supposing that, when thousands of men are unemployed
      and there are hard times everywhere, we could send a committee up to
      the high court of heaven to represent the misery and the poverty of the
      people here, consequent on their not being able to find employment.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>What answer would we get? "Are your lands all in use? Are your
      mines all worked out? Are there no natural opportunities for the
      employment of labor?" What could we ask the Creator to furnish us with
      that is not already here in abundance? He has given us the globe amply
      stocked with raw materials for our needs. He has given us the power of
      working up this raw material.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>If there seems scarcity, if there is want, if there are people
      starving in the midst of plenty, is it not simply because what the
      Creator intended for all has been made the property of the few? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">And in moving against this giant wrong,
      which denies to labor access to the natural opportunities for the
      employment of labor, we move against the cause of poverty. ... </span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>And is
      it not theft of the same kind when people go ahead in advance of
      population and get land they have no use whatever for, and then, as

      this increasing population use the land until they pay an exorbitant
      price?</b></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That is the sort of theft on which

      people will praise your forethought and your enterprise, and will say
      you have made money because you are a very superior person, and that
      all can make money if they will only work and be industrious! But is
      it not as clearly a violation of the command: "Thou shalt not steal,"
      as taking the money out of a person&#8217;s pocket?</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>"Thou shalt not steal." That
      means, of course, that we
      ourselves must not steal. But does it not also mean that we must not

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>"Thou shalt not steal." Does it
      not also mean: "Thou shalt not
      suffer thyself or anybody else to be stolen from?" If it does, then

      crime that produces poverty. Not merely the people who monopolize the
      land &#8212; they are not to blame above anyone else, but we who
      permit them to monopolize land are also parties to the theft. ...

      with those souls, what will it
      avail us to say that we individually were not responsible for their

      provided for them all. The earth that I made was broad enough to give
      them room. The materials that are placed in it were abundant enough
      for all their needs. Did you or did you not lift up your voice

      give enough and more than enough for all social purposes. These

        Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>... Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive
        term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
        of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your
        meaning, if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But
        reading it as a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private
        property in land shall be understood when you speak merely of private
        property. With this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge
        for private property in land are eight. Let us consider them in order
        of presentation. You urge:</p>
      <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.
        (RN, paragraph 5) ...<br>
        2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
        (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
        3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land.
        (RN, paragraph 8.) ...<br>
        4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself.
        (RN, paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
        5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion
        of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is
        sanctioned by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
        6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
        in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.)
        ...<br>
        7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases
        wealth, and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph
        51.) ...<br>
        8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature,
        not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to
        take the value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel
        to the private owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
      <p><strong>  1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.</strong> (5.)*</p>
      <p>Clearly, purchase and sale cannot give, but can only transfer ownership.
        Property that in itself has no moral sanction does not obtain moral sanction
        by passing from seller to buyer.</p>
      <p>If right reason does not make the slave the property of the slave-hunter
        it does not make him the property of the slave-buyer. Yet your reasoning
        as to private property in land would as well justify property in slaves.
        To show this it is only needful to change in your argument the word land
        to the word slave. It would then read:</p>
      <p>It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor,
        the very reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and to
        hold it as his own private possession.</p>
      <p>If one man hires out to another his strength or his industry, he does
        this for the purpose of receiving in return what is necessary for food
        and living; he thereby expressly proposes to acquire a full and legal
        right, not only to the remuneration, but also to the disposal of that
        remuneration as he pleases.</p>
      <p>Thus, if he lives sparingly, saves money, and invests his savings, for
        greater security, in a slave, the slave in such a case is only his wages
        in another form; and consequently, a working-man&#8217;s slave thus purchased
        should be as completely at his own disposal as the wages he receives
        for his labor.</p>
      <p>Nor in turning your argument for private property in land into an argument
        for private property in men am I doing a new thing. In my own country,
        in my own time, this very argument, that purchase gave ownership, was
        the common defense of slavery. It was made by statesmen, by jurists,
        by clergymen, by bishops; it was accepted over the whole country by the
        great mass of the people. By it was justified the separation of wives
        from husbands, of children from parents, the compelling of labor, the
        appropriation of its fruits, the buying and selling of Christians by
        Christians. In language almost identical with yours it was asked, &#8220;Here
        is a poor man who has worked hard, lived sparingly, and invested his
        savings in a few slaves. Would you rob him of his earnings by liberating
        those slaves?&#8221; Or it was said: &#8220;Here is a poor widow; all
        her husband has been able to leave her is a few negroes, the earnings
        of his hard toil. Would you rob the widow and the orphan by freeing these
        negroes?&#8221; And because of this perversion of reason, this confounding
        of unjust property rights with just property rights, this acceptance
        of man&#8217;s law as though it were God&#8217;s law, there came on our
        nation a judgment of fire and blood.</p>
      <p>The error of our people in thinking that what in itself was not rightfully
        property could become rightful property by purchase and sale is the same
        error into which your Holiness falls. It is not merely formally the same;
        it is essentially the same. Private property in land, no less than private
        property in slaves, is a violation of the true rights of property. They
        are different forms of the same robbery; twin devices by which the perverted
        ingenuity of man has sought to enable the strong and the cunning to escape
        God&#8217;s requirement of labor by forcing it on others.</p>
      <p>What difference does it make whether I merely own the land on which
        another man must live or own the man himself? Am I not in the one case
        as much his master as in the other? Can I not compel him to work for
        me? Can I not take to myself as much of the fruits of his labor; as fully
        dictate his actions? Have I not over him the power of life and death?</p>
      <p>For to deprive a man of land is as certainly to kill him as to deprive
        him of blood by opening his veins, or of air by tightening a halter around
        his neck.</p>
      <p>The essence of slavery is in empowering one man to obtain the labor
        of another without recompense. Private property in land does this as
        fully as chattel slavery. The slave-owner must leave to the slave enough
        of his earnings to enable him to live. Are there not in so-called free
        countries great bodies of working-men who get no more? How much more
        of the fruits of their toil do the agricultural laborers of Italy and
        England get than did the slaves of our Southern States? Did not private
        property in land permit the landowner of Europe in ruder times to demand
        the jus primae noctis? Does not the same last outrage exist today in
        diffused form in the immorality born of monstrous wealth on the one hand
        and ghastly poverty on the other?</p>
      <p>In what did the slavery of Russia consist but in giving to the master
        land on which the serf was forced to live? When an Ivan or a Catherine
        enriched their favorites with the labor of others they did not give men,
        they gave land. And when the appropriation of land has gone so far that
        no free land remains to which the landless man may turn, then without
        further violence the more insidious form of labor robbery involved in
        private property in land takes the place of chattel slavery, because
        more economical and convenient. For under it the slave does not have
        to be caught or held, or to be fed when not needed. He comes of himself,
        begging the privilege of serving, and when no longer wanted can be discharged.
        The lash is unnecessary; hunger is as efficacious. This is why the Norman
        conquerors of England and the English conquerors of Ireland did not divide
        up the people, but divided the land. This is why European slave-ships
        took their cargoes to the New World, not to Europe.</p>
      <p>Slavery is not yet abolished. Though in all Christian countries its
        ruder form has now gone, it still exists in the heart of our civilization
        in more insidious form, and is increasing. There is work to be done for
        the glory of God and the liberty of man by other soldiers of the cross
        than those warrior monks whom, with the blessing of your Holiness, Cardinal
        Lavigerie is sending into the Sahara. Yet, your Encyclical employs in
        defense of one form of slavery the same fallacies that the apologists
        for chattel slavery used in defense of the other!</p>
      <p>The Arabs are not wanting in acumen. Your Encyclical reaches far. What
        shall your warrior monks say, if when at the muzzle of their rifles they
        demand of some Arab slave-merchant his miserable caravan, he shall declare
        that he bought them with his savings, and producing a copy of your Encyclical,
        shall prove by your reasoning that his slaves are consequently &#8220;only
        his wages in another form,&#8221; and ask if they who bear your blessing
        and own your authority propose to &#8220;deprive him of the liberty of
        disposing of his wages and thus of all hope and possibility of increasing
        his stock and bettering his condition in life&#8221;? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
      <p><strong>5. That private property in land has the support of the common
          opinion of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and
          that it is
        sanctioned by Divine Law.</strong> (11.)</p>
      <p>Even were it true that the common opinion of mankind has sanctioned
        private property in land, this would no more prove its justice than the
        once universal practice of the known world would have proved the justice
        of slavery.</p>
      <p>But it is not true. Examination will show that wherever we can trace
        them the first perceptions of mankind have always recognized the equality
        of right to land, and that when individual possession became necessary
        to secure the right of ownership in things produced by labor some method
        of securing equality, sufficient in the existing state of social development,
        was adopted. Thus, among some peoples, land used for cultivation was
        periodically divided, land used for pasturage and wood being held in
        common. Among others, every family was permitted to hold what land it
        needed for a dwelling and for cultivation, but the moment that such use
        and cultivation stopped any one else could step in and take it on like
        tenure. Of the same nature were the land laws of the Mosaic code. The
        land, first fairly divided among the people, was made inalienable by
        the provision of the jubilee, under which, if sold, it reverted every
        fiftieth year to the children of its original possessors.</p>
      <p>Private property in land as we know it, the attaching to land of the
        same right of ownership that justly attaches to the products of labor,
        has never grown up anywhere save by usurpation or force. Like slavery,
        it is the result of war. It comes to us of the modern world from your
        ancestors, the Romans, whose civilization it corrupted and whose empire
        it destroyed.</p>
      <p>It made with the freer spirit of the northern peoples the combination
        of the feudal system, in which, though subordination was substituted
        for equality, there was still a rough recognition of the principle of
        common rights in land. A fief was a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed
        some obligation. The sovereign, the representative of the whole people,
        was the only owner of land. Of him, immediately or mediately, held tenants,
        whose possession involved duties or payments, which, though rudely and
        imperfectly, embodied the idea that we would carry out in the single
        tax, of taking land values for public uses. The crown lands maintained
        the sovereign and the civil list; the church lands defrayed the cost
        of public worship and instruction, of the relief of the sick, the destitute
        and the wayworn; while the military tenures provided for public defense
        and bore the costs of war. A fourth and very large portion of the land
        remained in common, the people of the neighborhood being free to pasture
        it, cut wood on it, or put it to other common uses.</p>
      <p>In this partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to land
        is to be found the reason why, in a time when the industrial arts were
        rude, wars frequent, and the great discoveries and inventions of our
        time unthought of, the condition of the laborer was devoid of that grinding
        poverty which despite our marvelous advances now exists. <strong>Speaking
        of England, the highest authority on such subjects, the late Professor
        Therold
        Rogers, declares that in the thirteenth century there was no class so
        poor, so helpless, so pressed and degraded as are millions of Englishmen
        in our boasted nineteenth century; and that, save in times of actual
        famine, there was no laborer so poor as to fear that his wife and children
        might come to want even were he taken from them.</strong> Dark and rude in many
        respects as they were, these were the times when the cathedrals and churches
        and religious houses whose ruins yet excite our admiration were built;
        the times when England had no national debt, no poor law, no standing
        army, <strong>no hereditary paupers, no thousands and thousands of human beings
        rising in the morning without knowing where they might lay their heads
        at night.</strong></p>
      <p>With the decay of the feudal system, the system of private property
        in land that had destroyed Rome was extended. As to England, it may briefly
        be said that the crown lands were for the most part given away to favorites;
        that the church lands were parceled among his courtiers by Henry VIII.,
        and in Scotland grasped by the nobles; that the military dues were finally
        remitted in the seventeenth century, and taxation on consumption substituted;
        and that by a process beginning with the Tudors and extending to our
        own time all but a mere fraction of the commons were inclosed by the
        greater landowners; while the same private ownership of land was extended
        over Ireland and the Scottish Highlands, partly by the sword and partly
        by bribery of the chiefs. Even the military dues, had they been commuted,
        not remitted, would today have more than sufficed to pay all public expenses
        without one penny of other taxation.</p>
      <p>Of the New World, whose institutions but continue those of Europe, it
        is only necessary to say that to the parceling out of land in great tracts
        is due the backwardness and turbulence of Spanish America; that to the
        large plantations of the Southern States of the Union was due the persistence
        of slavery there, and that the more northern settlements showed the earlier
        English feeling, land being fairly well divided and the attempts to establish
        manorial estates coming to little or nothing. In this lies the secret
        of the more vigorous growth of the Northern States. But the idea that
        land was to be treated as private property had been thoroughly established
        in English thought before the colonial period ended, and it has been
        so treated by the United States and by the several States. And though
        land was at first sold cheaply, and then given to actual settlers, it
        was also sold in large quantities to speculators, given away in great
        tracts for railroads and other purposes, until now the public domain
        of the United States, which a generation ago seemed illimitable, has
        practically gone. And this, as the experience of other countries shows,
        is the natural result in a growing community of making land private property.
        When the possession of land means the gain of unearned wealth, the strong
        and unscrupulous will secure it. But when, as we propose, economic rent,
        the &#8220;unearned increment of wealth,&#8221; is taken by the state
        for the use of the community, then land will pass into the hands of users
        and remain there, since no matter how great its value, its possession
        will be profitable only to users.</p>
      <p>As to private property in land having conduced to the peace and tranquillity
        of human life, it is not necessary more than to allude to the notorious
        fact that the struggle for land has been the prolific source of wars
        and of lawsuits, while it is the poverty engendered by private property
        in land that makes the prison and the workhouse the unfailing attributes
        of what we call Christian civilization.</p>
      <p>Your Holiness intimates that the Divine Law gives its sanction to the
        private ownership of land, quoting from Deuteronomy, &#8220;Thou shalt
        not covet thy neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his house, nor his field, nor
        his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything
        which is his.&#8221;</p>
      <p>If, as your Holiness conveys, this inclusion of the words, &#8220;nor
        his field,&#8221; is to be taken as sanctioning private property in land
        as it exists today, then, but with far greater force, must the words, &#8220;his
        man-servant, nor his maid-servant,&#8221; be taken to sanction chattel
        slavery; for it is evident from other provisions of the same code that
        these terms referred both to bondsmen for a term of years and to perpetual
        slaves. But the word &#8220;field&#8221; involves the idea of use and
        improvement, to which the right of possession and ownership does attach
        without recognition of property in the land itself. And that this reference
        to the &#8220;field&#8221; is not a sanction of private property in land
        as it exists today is proved by the fact that the Mosaic code expressly
        denied such unqualified ownership in land, and with the declaration, &#8220;the
        land also shall not be sold forever, because it is mine, and you are
        strangers and sojourners with me,&#8221; provided for its reversion every
        fiftieth year; thus, in a way adapted to the primitive industrial conditions
        of the time, securing to all of the chosen people a foothold in the soil.</p>
      <p>Nowhere in fact throughout the Scriptures can the slightest justification
        be found for the attaching to land of the same right of property that
        justly attaches to the things produced by labor. Everywhere is it treated
        as the free bounty of God, &#8220;the land which the Lord thy God giveth
        thee.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>  6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
          in land is necessary to enable them to do so. </strong>(14-17.)</p>
      <p>With all that your Holiness has to say of the sacredness of the family
        relation we are in full accord. But how the obligation of the father
        to the child can justify private property in land we cannot see. You
        reason that private property in land is necessary to the discharge of
        the duty of the father, and is therefore requisite and just, because &#8212;</p>
      <p>It is a most sacred law of nature that a father must provide food and
        all necessaries for those whom he has begotten; and, similarly, nature
        dictates that a man&#8217;s children, who carry on, as it were, and continue
        his own personality, should be provided by him with all that is needful
        to enable them honorably to keep themselves from want and misery in the
        uncertainties of this mortal life. Now, in no other way can a father
        effect this except by the ownership of profitable property, which he
        can transmit to his children by inheritance. (14.)</p>
      <p>Thanks to Him who has bound the generations of men together by a provision
        that brings the tenderest love to greet our entrance into the world and
        soothes our exit with filial piety, it is both the duty and the joy of
        the father to care for the child till its powers mature, and afterwards
        in the natural order it becomes the duty and privilege of the child to
        be the stay of the parent. This is the natural reason for that relation
        of marriage, the groundwork of the sweetest, tenderest and purest of
        human joys, which the Catholic Church has guarded with such unremitting
        vigilance.</p>
      <p>We do, for a few years, need the providence of our fathers after the
        flesh. But how small, how transient, how narrow is this need, as compared
        with our constant need for the providence of Him in whom we live, move
        and have our being &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven! It is to him, &#8220;the
        giver of every good and perfect gift,&#8221; and not to our fathers after
        the flesh, that Christ taught us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our
        daily bread.&#8221; And how true it is that it is through him that the
        generations of men exist! Let the mean temperature of the earth rise
        or fall a few degrees, an amount as nothing compared with differences
        produced in our laboratories, and mankind would disappear as ice disappears
        under a tropical sun, would fall as the leaves fall at the touch of frost.
        Or, let for two or three seasons the earth refuse her increase, and how
        many of our millions would remain alive?</p>
      <p>The duty of fathers to transmit to their children profitable property
        that will enable them to keep themselves from want and misery in the
        uncertainties of this mortal life! What is not possible cannot be a duty.
        And how is it possible for fathers to do that? Your Holiness has not
        considered how mankind really lives from hand to mouth, getting each
        day its daily bread; how little one generation does or can leave another.
        It is doubtful if the wealth of the civilized world all told amounts
        to anything like as much as one year&#8217;s labor, while it is certain
        that if labor were to stop and men had to rely on existing accumulation,
        it would be only a few days ere in the richest countries pestilence and
        famine would stalk.<br>
        The profitable property your Holiness refers to, is private property
        in land. Now profitable land, as all economists will agree, is land superior
        to the land that the ordinary man can get. It is land that will yield
        an income to the owner as owner, and therefore that will permit the owner
        to appropriate the products of labor without doing labor, its profitableness
        to the individual involving the robbery of other individuals. It is therefore
        possible only for some fathers to leave their children profitable land.
        What therefore your Holiness practically declares is, that it is the
        duty of all fathers to struggle to leave their children what only the
        few peculiarly strong, lucky or unscrupulous can leave; and that, a something
        that involves the robbery of others &#8212; their deprivation of the
        material gifts of God.</p>
      <p>This anti-Christian doctrine has been long in practice throughout the
        Christian world. What are its results?</p>
      <p>Are they not the very evils set forth in your Encyclical? Are they not,
        so far from enabling men to keep themselves from want and misery in the
        uncertainties of this mortal life, to condemn the great masses of men
        to want and misery that the natural conditions of our mortal life do
        not entail; to want and misery deeper and more wide-spread than exist
        among heathen savages? Under the r&eacute;gime of private property in
        land and in the richest countries not five per cent of fathers are able
        at their death to leave anything substantial to their children, and probably
        a large majority do not leave enough to bury them! Some few children
        are left by their fathers richer than it is good for them to be, but
        the vast majority not only are left nothing by their fathers, but by
        the system that makes land private property are deprived of the bounty
        of their Heavenly Father; are compelled to sue others for permission
        to live and to work, and to toil all their lives for a pittance that
        often does not enable them to escape starvation and pauperism.</p>
      <p>What your Holiness is actually, though of course inadvertently, urging,
        is that earthly fathers should assume the functions of the Heavenly Father.
        It is not the business of one generation to provide the succeeding generation &#8220;with
        all that is needful to enable them honorably to keep themselves from
        want and misery.&#8221; That is God&#8217;s business. We no more create
        our children than we create our fathers. It is God who is the Creator
        of each succeeding generation as fully as of the one that preceded it.
        And, to recall your own words (7), &#8220;Nature [God], therefore, owes
        to man a storehouse that shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily
        wants. And this he finds only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; What
        you are now assuming is, that it is the duty of men to provide for the
        wants of their children by appropriating this storehouse and depriving
        other men&#8217;s children of the unfailing supply that God has provided
        for all.</p>
      <p>The duty of the father to the child &#8212; the duty possible to all
        fathers! Is it not so to conduct himself, so to nurture and teach it,
        that it shall come to manhood with a sound body, well-developed mind,
        habits of virtue, piety and industry, and in a state of society that
        shall give it and all others free access to the bounty of God, the providence
        of the All-Father?</p>
      <p>In doing this the father would be doing more to secure his children
        from want and misery than is possible now to the richest of fathers &#8212; as
        much more as the providence of God surpasses that of man. For the justice
        of God laughs at the efforts of men to circumvent it, and the subtle
        law that binds humanity together poisons the rich in the sufferings of
        the poor. Even the few who are able in the general struggle to leave
        their children wealth that they fondly think will keep them from want
        and misery in the uncertainties of this mortal life &#8212; do they succeed?
        Does experience show that it is a benefit to a child to place him above
        his fellows and enable him to think God&#8217;s law of labor is not for
        him? Is not such wealth oftener a curse than a blessing, and does not
        its expectation often destroy filial love and bring dissensions and heartburnings
        into families? And how far and how long are even the richest and strongest
        able to exempt their children from the common lot? Nothing is more certain
        than that the blood of the masters of the world flows today in lazzaroni
        and that the descendants of kings and princes tenant slums and workhouses.</p>
      <p>But in the state of society we strive for, where the monopoly and waste
        of God&#8217;s bounty would be done away with and the fruits of labor
        would go to the laborer, it would be within the ability of all to make
        more than a comfortable living with reasonable labor. And for those who
        might be crippled or incapacitated, or deprived of their natural protectors
        and breadwinners, the most ample provision could be made out of that
        great and increasing fund with which God in his law of rent has provided
        society &#8212; not as a matter of niggardly and degrading alms, but
        as a matter of right, as the assurance which in a Christian state society
        owes to all its members.</p>
      <p>Thus it is that the duty of the father, the obligation to the child,
        instead of giving any support to private property in land, utterly condemns
        it, urging us by the most powerful considerations to abolish it in the
        simple and efficacious way of the single tax.</p>
      <p>This duty of the father, this obligation to children, is not confined
        to those who have actually children of their own, but rests on all of
        us who have come to the powers and responsibilities of manhood.</p>
      <p>For did not Christ set a little child in the midst of the disciples,
        saying to them that the angels of such little ones always behold the
        face of his Father; saying to them that it were better for a man to hang
        a millstone about his neck and plunge into the uttermost depths of the
        sea than to injure such a little one?</p>
      <p>And what today is the result of private property in land in the richest
        of so-called Christian countries? Is it not that young people fear to
        marry; that married people fear to have children; that children are driven
        out of life from sheer want of proper nourishment and care, or compelled
        to toil when they ought to be at school or at play; that great numbers
        of those who attain maturity enter it with under-nourished bodies, overstrained
        nerves, undeveloped minds &#8212; under conditions that foredoom them,
        not merely to suffering, but to crime; that fit them in advance for the
        prison and the brothel?</p>
      <p>If your Holiness will consider these things we are confident that instead
        of defending private property in land you will condemn it with anathema!
        <font size="+1"><strong>...       </strong></font></p>
      <p>... The explanation of this and of similar paradoxes that in our time
        perplex on every side may be easily seen. The effect of all inventions
        and improvements
        that increase productive power, that save waste and economize effort,
        is to lessen the labor required for a given result, and thus to save
        labor, so that we speak of them as labor-saving inventions or improvements.
        Now, in a natural state of society where the rights of all to the use
        of the earth are acknowledged, labor-saving improvements might go to
        the very utmost that can be imagined without lessening the demand for
        men, since in such natural conditions the demand for men lies in their
        own enjoyment of life and the strong instincts that the Creator has implanted
        in the human breast. But in that unnatural state of society where the
        masses of men are disinherited of all but the power to labor when opportunity
        to labor is given them by others, there the demand for them becomes simply
        the demand for their services by those who hold this opportunity, and
        man himself becomes a commodity. Hence, although the natural effect of
        labor-saving improvement is to increase wages, yet in the unnatural condition
        which private ownership of the land begets, the effect, even of such
        moral improvements as the disbandment of armies and the saving of the
        labor that vice entails, is, by lessening the commercial demand, to lower
        wages and reduce mere laborers to starvation or pauperism. If labor-saving
        inventions and improvements could be carried to the very abolition of
        the necessity for labor, what would be the result? Would it not be that
        landowners could then get all the wealth that the land was capable of
        producing, and would have no need at all for laborers, who must then
        either starve or live as pensioners on the bounty of the landowners?</p>
      <p><strong>Thus, so long as private property in land continues &#8212; so long
        as some men are treated as owners of the earth and other men can live
        on it only by their sufferance &#8212; human wisdom can devise no means
        by which the evils of our present condition may be avoided.</strong></p>
      <p>Nor yet could the wisdom of God.</p>
      <p>By the light of that right reason of which St. Thomas speaks we may
        see that even he, the Almighty, so long as his laws remain what they
        are, could do nothing to prevent poverty and starvation while property
        in land continues.</p>
      <p>How could he? Should he infuse new vigor into the sunlight, new virtue
        into the air, new fertility into the soil, would not all this new bounty
        go to the owners of the land, and work not benefit, but rather injury,
        to mere laborers? Should he open the minds of men to the possibilities
        of new substances, new adjustments, new powers, could this do any more
        to relieve poverty than steam, electricity and all the numberless discoveries
        and inventions of our time have done? Or, if he were to send down from
        the heavens above or cause to gush up from the subterranean depths, food,
        clothing, all the things that satisfy man&#8217;s material desires, to
        whom under our laws would all these belong? So far from benefiting man,
        would not this increase and extension of his bounty prove but a curse,
        enabling the privileged class more riotously to roll in wealth, and bringing
        the disinherited class to more wide-spread starvation or pauperism?<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
      <p>Believing that the social question is at bottom a religious question,
          we deem it of happy augury to the world that in your Encyclical the most
          influential of all religious teachers has directed attention to the condition
          of labor.</p>
      <p>But while we appreciate the many wholesome truths you utter, while we
        feel, as all must feel, that you are animated by <strong>a desire to
        help the suffering and oppressed</strong>, and to put an end to any idea that the church
        is divorced from the aspiration for liberty and progress, yet it is painfully
        obvious to us that <strong>one fatal assumption hides from you the cause
        of the evils you see, and makes it impossible for you to propose any
        adequate
        remedy. This assumption is, that private property in land is of the same
        nature and has the same sanctions as private property in things produced
        by labor.</strong> In spite of its undeniable truths and its benevolent spirit,
        your Encyclical shows you to be involved in such difficulties as a physician
        called to examine one suffering from disease of the stomach would meet
        should he begin with a refusal to consider the stomach.</p>
      <p>Prevented by this assumption from seeing the true cause, the only causes
        you find it possible to assign for the growth of misery and wretchedness
        are the destruction of working-men&#8217;s guilds in the last century,
        the repudiation in public institutions and laws of the ancient religion,
        rapacious usury, the custom of working by contract, and the concentration
        of trade.</p>
      <p>Such diagnosis is manifestly inadequate to account for evils that are
        alike felt in Catholic countries, in Protestant countries, in countries
        that adhere to the Greek communion and in countries where no religion
        is professed by the state; that are alike felt in old countries and in
        new countries; where industry is simple and where it is most elaborate;
        and amid all varieties of industrial customs and relations.</p>
      <p><strong>But the real cause will be clear if you will consider that since labor
        must find its workshop and reservoir in land, the labor question is but
        another name for the land question, and will reexamine your assumption
        that private property in land is necessary and right.</strong></p>
      <p>See how fully adequate is the cause I have pointed out. The most important
        of all the material relations of man is his relation to the planet he
        inhabits, and hence, the &#8220;impious resistance to the benevolent
        intentions of his Creator,&#8221; which, as <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Bishop
        Nulty</a> says, is involved
        in private property in land, must produce evils wherever it exists. But
        by virtue of the law, &#8220;unto whom much is given, from him much is
        required,&#8221; the very progress of civilization makes the evils produced
        by private property in land more wide-spread and intense.</p>
      <p><strong>What is producing throughout the civilized world that condition
          of things you rightly describe as intolerable is not this and that
          local error
        or minor mistake. It is nothing less than the progress of civilization
        itself; nothing less than the intellectual advance and the material growth
        in which our century has been so preeminent, acting in a state of society
        based on private property in land; nothing less than the new gifts that
        in our time God has been showering on man, but which are being turned
        into scourges by man&#8217;s &#8220;impious resistance to the benevolent
        intentions of his Creator.&#8221;</strong></p>
      <p>The discoveries of science, the gains of invention, have given to us
        in this wonderful century more than has been given to men in any time
        before; and, in a degree so rapidly accelerating as to suggest geometrical
        progression, are placing in our hands new material powers. But with the
        benefit comes the obligation. In a civilization beginning to pulse with
        steam and electricity, where the sun paints pictures and the phonograph
        stores speech, it will not do to be merely as just as were our fathers.
        Intellectual advance and material advance require corresponding moral
        advance. Knowledge and power are neither good nor evil. They are not
        ends but means &#8212; evolving forces that if not controlled in orderly
        relations must take disorderly and destructive forms. The deepening pain,
        the increasing perplexity, the growing discontent for which, as you truly
        say, some remedy must be found and quickly found, mean nothing less than
        that forces of destruction swifter and more terrible than those that
        have shattered every preceding civilization are already menacing ours &#8212; that
        if it does not quickly rise to a higher moral level; if it does not become
        in deed as in word a Christian civilization, on the wall of its splendor
        must flame the doom of Babylon: &#8220;Thou art weighed in the balance
        and found wanting!&#8221; <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
      <p>It seems to us that your Holiness misses its real significance in intimating
        that Christ, in becoming the son of a carpenter and himself working as
        a carpenter, showed merely that &#8220;there is nothing to be ashamed
        of in seeking one&#8217;s bread by labor.&#8221; To say that is almost
        like saying that by not robbing people he showed that there is nothing
        to be ashamed of in honesty. If you will consider how true in any large
        view is <strong>the classification of all men into working-men, beggar-men
        and thieves</strong>, you will see that it was morally impossible that Christ during
        his stay on earth should have been anything else than a working-man,
        since he who came to fulfil the law must by deed as well as word obey
        God&#8217;s law of labor.</p>
      <p>See how fully and how beautifully Christ&#8217;s life on earth illustrated
        this law. Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as it
        is appointed that all should enter it, he lovingly took what in the natural
        order is lovingly rendered, the sustenance, secured by labor, that one
        generation owes to its immediate successors. Arrived at maturity, he
        earned his own subsistence by that common labor in which the majority
        of men must and do earn it. Then passing to a higher &#8212; to the very
        highest &#8212; sphere of labor, he earned his subsistence by the teaching
        of moral and spiritual truths, receiving its material wages in the love-offerings
        of grateful hearers, and not refusing the costly spikenard with which
        Mary anointed his feet. So, when he chose his disciples, he did not go

        to common laboring-men. And when he called them to a higher sphere of
        labor and sent them out to teach moral and spiritual truths, he told
        them to take, without condescension on the one hand or sense of degradation
        on the other, the loving return for such labor, saying to them that &#8220;the
        laborer is worthy of his hire,&#8221; thus showing, what we hold, that
        all labor does not consist in what is called manual labor, but that whoever
        helps to add to the material, intellectual, moral or spiritual fullness
        of life is also a laborer.*</p>

      <p>In assuming that laborers, even ordinary manual laborers, are naturally
        poor, you ignore the fact that labor is the producer of wealth, and attribute
        to the natural law of the Creator an injustice that comes from man&#8217;s
        impious violation of his benevolent intention. In the rudest stage of
        the arts it is possible, where justice prevails, for all well men to
        earn a living. With the labor-saving appliances of our time, it should
        be possible for all to earn much more. And so, in saying that poverty
        is no disgrace, you convey an unreasonable implication. <strong>For poverty ought
        to be a disgrace, since in a condition of social justice, it would, where

      <p>THE general subjection of the many to the few, which we meet with wherever
        society has reached a certain development, has resulted from the appropriation
        of land as individual property. It is the ownership of the soil that
        everywhere gives the ownership of the men that live upon it. It is slavery
        of this kind to which the enduring pyramids and the colossal monuments
        of Egypt yet bear witness, and of the institution of which we have, perhaps,
        a vague tradition in the biblical story of the famine during which the
        Pharaoh purchased up the lands of the people. It was slavery of this
        kind to which, in the twilight of history, the conquerors of Greece reduced
        the original inhabitants of that peninsula, transforming them into helots
        by making them pay rent for their lands. It was the growth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">latifundia</span>,
        or great landed estates, which transmuted the population of ancient Italy
        from a race of hardy husbandmen, whose robust virtues conquered the world,
        into a race of cringing bondsmen; it was the appropriation of the land
        as the absolute property of their chieftains which gradually turned the
        descendants of free and equal Gallic, Teutonic and Hunnish warriors into
        colonii and villains, and which changed the independent burghers of Sclavonic
        village communities into the boors of Russia and the serfs of Poland;
        which instituted the feudalism of China and Japan, as well as that of
        Europe, and which made the High Chiefs of Polynesia the all but absolute
        masters of their fellows. How it came to pass that the Aryan shepherds
        and warriors who, as comparative philology tells us, descended from the
        common birth-place of the Indo-Germanic race into the lowlands of India,
        were turned into the suppliant and cringing Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse
        which I have before quoted gives us a hint. The white parasols and the
        elephants mad with pride of the Indian Rajah are the flowers of grants
        of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

TRACE to their root the causes that are thus producing want in the midst of plenty,
ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in democracy, weakness in
strength &#8212; that are giving to our civilization a one-sided and unstable
development, and you will find it something which this Hebrew statesman three
thousand years ago perceived and guarded against. Moses saw that the real cause
of the enslavement of the masses of Egypt was, what has everywhere produced enslavement,
the possession by a class of the land upon which, and from which, the whole people
must live. He saw that to permit in land the same unqualified private ownership
that by natural right attaches to the things produced by labor, would be inevitably
to separate the people into the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave
labor &#8212; to make the few the masters of. the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation, no matter what the religion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates not for the
need of a day, but for all the future, he sought, in ways suited to his times
and conditions, to guard against this error. &#8212; <a href="Moses.html">Moses</a><br>

      <p>But it is not alone to objects of charity that the question of poverty
        calls our attention. There is a keener poverty, which pinches and goes
        hungry, but is beyond the reach of charity because it never complains.
        And back of all and over all is fear of poverty, which chills the best
        instincts of men of every social grade, from recipients of out-door relief
        who dread the poorhouse, to millionaires who dread the possibility of
        poverty for their children if not for themselves.38</p>

      <p>It is poverty and fear of poverty that prompt men of honest instincts
        to steal, to bribe, to take bribes, to oppress, either under color of
        law or against law, and &#8212; what is worst than all, because it is
        not merely a depraved act, but a course of conduct that implies a state
        of depravity &#8212; to enlist their talents in crusades against their
        convictions. 39 Our civilization cannot long resist such enemies as poverty
        and fear of poverty breed; to intelligent observers it already seems
        to yield. 40</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">39. &quot;From whence springs this lust for gain, to gratify which men
            tread everything pure and noble under their feet; to which they sacrifice
            all the higher possibilities of life; which converts civility into a
            hollow pretense, patriotism into a sham, and religion into hypocrisy;
            which makes so much of civilized existence an Ishmaelitish warfare, of
            which the weapons are cunning and fraud? Does it not spring from the
            existence of want? Carlyle somewhere says that poverty is the hell of
            which the modern Englishman is most afraid. And he is right. Poverty
            is the openmouthed, relentless hell which yawns beneath civilized society.
            And it is hell enough. The Vedas declare no truer thing than when the
            wise crow Bushanda tells the eagle-bearer of Vishnu that the keenest
            pain is in poverty. For poverty is not merely deprivation; it means shame,
            degradation; the searing of the most sensitive parts of our moral and
            mental nature as with hot irons; the denial of the strongest impulses
            and the sweetest affections; the wrenching of the most vital nerves.
            You love your wife, you love your children; but would it not be easier
            to see them die than to see them reduced to the pinch of want in which
            large classes in every highly civilized community live? ... From this
            hell of poverty, it is but natural that men should make every effort
            to escape. With the impulse to self-preservation and self-gratification
            combine nobler feelings, and love as well as fear urges in the struggle.
            Many a man does a mean thing, a dishonest thing, a greedy and grasping
            and unjust thing, in the effort to place above want, or the fear of want,

        <p><font size="-1">40. &quot;There is just now a disposition to scoff at
              any implication that we are not in all respects progressing ... Yet
              it is evident that
            there have been times of decline, just as there have been times of advance;
            and it is further evident that these epochs of decline could not at first
            have been generally recognized.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;He would have been a rash man who, when Augustus was changing
            the Rome of brick to the Rome of marble, when wealth was augmenting and
            magnificence increasing, when victorious legions were extending the frontier,
            when manners were becoming more refined, language more polished, and
            literature rising to higher splendors &#8212; he would have been a rash
            man who then would have said that Rome was entering her decline. Yet
            such was the case.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;And whoever will look may see that though our
              civilization is apparently advancing with greater rapidity than ever,
              the same cause
            which turned Roman progress into retrogression is operating now.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;What has destroyed every previous civilization
              has been the tendency to the unequal distribution of wealth and power.
              This same tendency,
            operating with increasing force, is observable in our civilization today,
            showing itself in every progressive community, and with greater intensity
            the more progressive the community. ... The conditions of social progress,
            as we have traced the law, are association and equality. The general
            tendency of modern development, since the time when we can first discern
            the gleams of civilization in the darkness which followed the fall of
            the Western Empire, has been toward political and legal equality ...
            This tendency has reached its full expression in the American Republic,
            where political and legal rights are absolutely equal ... it is the prevailing
            tendency, and how soon Europe will be completely republican is only a
            matter of time, or rather of accident. The United States are therefore
            in this respect, the most advanced of all the great nations, in a direction
            in which all are advancing, and in the United States we see just how
            much this tendency to personal and political freedom can of itself accomplish.
            ... It is now ... evident that political equality, coexisting with an
            increasing tendency to the unequal distribution of wealth, must ultimately
            beget either the despotism of organized tyranny or the worse despotism
            of anarchy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;To turn a republican government into a despotism the basest and
            most brutal, it is not necessary formally to change its constitution
            or abandon popular elections. It was centuries after C&aelig;sar before
            the absolute master of the Roman world pretended to rule other than by
            authority of a Senate that trembled before him.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;But forms are nothing when substance has gone, and the forms of
            popular government are those from which the substance of freedom may
            most easily go. Extremes meet, and a government of universal suffrage
            and theoretical equality may, under conditions which impel the change,
            most readily become a despotism. For there despotism advances in the
            name and with the might of the people. ... And when the disparity of
            condition increases, so does universal suffrage make it easy to seize
            the source of power, for the greater is the proportion of power in the
            hands of those who feel no direct interest in the conduct of government;
            who, tortured by want and embruted by poverty, are ready to sell their
            votes to the highest bidder or follow the lead of the most blatant demagogue;
            or who, made bitter by hardships, may even look upon profligate and tyrannous
            government with the satisfaction we may imagine the proletarians and
            slaves of Rome to have felt, as they saw a Caligula or Nero raging among
            the rich patricians. ... Now this transformation of popular government
            into despotism of the vilest and most degrading kind, which must inevitably
            result from the unequal distribution of wealth, is not a thing of the
            far future. It has already begun in the United States, and is rapidly
            going on under our eyes. ... The type of modern growth is the great city.
            Here are to be found the greatest wealth and the deepest poverty. And
            it is here that popular government has most clearly broken down. ...
            In theory we are intense democrats. ... But is there not growing up among
            us a class who have all the power without any of the virtues of aristocracy?
            ... Industry everywhere tends to assume a form in which one is master
            and many serve. And when one is master and the others serve, the one
            will control the others, even in such matters as votes. ... There is
            no mistaking it &#8212; the very foundations of society are being sapped
            before our eyes ... It is shown in greatest force where the inequalities
            in the distribution of wealth are greatest, and it shows itself as they
            increase. ... Though we may not speak it openly, the general faith in
            republican institutions is, where they have reached their fullest development,
            narrowing and weakening. It is no longer that confident belief in republicanism
            as the source of national blessings that it once was. Thoughtful men
            are beginning to see its dangers, without seeing how to escape them;
            are beginning to accept the view of Macaulay and distrust that of Jefferson.
            And the people at large are becoming used to the growing corruption.
            The most ominous political sign in the United States today is the growth
            of a sentiment which either doubts the existence of an honest man in
            public office or looks on him as a fool for not seizing his opportunities.
            That is to say, the people themselves are becoming corrupted. Thus in
            the United States to-day is republican government running the course
            it must inevitably follow under conditions which cause the unequal distribution
            of wealth.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book x, ch. iv.</font></p>

      <p>        But how is the development of these social enemies to be arrested? Only
          by tracing poverty to its cause, and, having found the cause, deliberately
          removing it. Poverty cannot be traced to its cause, however, without
          serious thought; not mere reading and school study and other tutoring,
          but thought. 41 To jump at a conclusion is very likely to jump over
          the cause, at which no class is more apt than the tutored class.42
          We must proceed step by step from familiar and indisputable premises.

      <p><strong><em>d. Dependence of Labor upon Land</em></strong></p>
      <p>We have now seen that division of labor and trade, the distinguishing
        characteristics of civilization, not only increase labor power, but grow
        out of a law of human nature which tends, by maintaining a perpetual
        revolution of the circle of trade, to cause opportunities for mutual
        employment to correspond to desire for wealth. Surely there could be
        no lack of employment if the circle flowed freely in accordance with
        the principle here illustrated; work would abound until want was satisfied.
        There must therefore be some obstruction. That indirect taxes hamper
        trade, we have already seen;78 but there is a more fundamental obstruction.
        As we learned at the outset, all the material wants of men are satisfied
        by Labor from Land. Even personal services cannot be rendered without
        the use of appropriate land.79 Let us then introduce into the preceding
        chart, in addition to the different classes of Labor, the corresponding
        classes of Land-owning interests, indicating them by black balls:</p>

            and grades of Food-makers, but also for as many different kinds of
            land as there are different kinds of labor set at work. So a demand
            for clothing is not only a demand for Clothing-makers, a demand for
            shelter is not only one for Shelter-makers, a demand for luxuries
            is not only one for Luxury-makers, a demand for services is not only
            one for Personal Servants, but those demands are also demands for
            appropriate land &#8212; pasture land for wool, cotton land for cotton,
            factory land, water fronts and rights of way, store sites, residence

        from the various classes of Labor to the various Land-owning interests

      <ul>
        <li>They do not produce the land which they charge laborers for using;
          nature provides that. </li>
        <li>They do not give value to it; Labor as a whole does that. </li>
        <li>They do not protect the community through the police, the courts,
          or the army, nor assist it through schools and post offices; organized
          society does that to the extent to which it is done, and the Land-owning
          interests contribute nothing toward it other than a part of what they
          exact from Labor.80 </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As between Labor interests and Land-owning interests the arrows can
        be made to run only in the one direction.</p>

          of the Land-owning interests so expand &#8212; so enlarge the drain
          from Labor &#8212; as to make it increasingly difficult for any of
          the workers to obtain the Land they need in order to satisfy the demands
          made upon them for the kind of Wealth they produce. Would it then be
          much of a problem to determine the cause of poverty or to explain hard
          times?</strong> Assuredly not. It would be plain that poverty and hard
          times are due to obstacles placed by Land-owning interests in the way
          of Labor's access to Land.</p>

        the fundamental cause of poverty is the divorce of Labor from Land. 81
        But the manner in which that divorce is accomplished in the civilized
        state remains to be explained. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
      <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
      <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social
        progress, while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if
        Rent be treated as common property, advances in productive power shall
        be steps in the direction of realizing through orderly and natural growth
        those grand conceptions of both the socialist and the individualist,
        which in the present condition of society are justly ranked as Utopian?
        <strong>Is it not likewise a plain warning that if Rent be treated as
        private property, advances in productive power will be steps in the direction
        of making slaves of the many laborers, and masters of a few land-owners? Does
        it not mean that common ownership of Rent is in harmony with natural
        law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly and degrading?</strong>        When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the preceding
        chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth that God
        made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how can a
        contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97 the
        benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
        to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses.
        98</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary
            settler. Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public
            revenues, and none of the land about him has any value. Another settler
            comes, and another, until a village appears. Some public revenue
            is then required. Not much, but some. And the land has a little value,
            only a little; perhaps just enough to equal the need for public revenue.
            The village becomes a town. More revenues are needed, and land values
            are higher. It becomes a city. The public revenues required are enormous,
            and so are the land values.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising
            with the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline
            of society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as
            distinguished from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand,
            measure the earning power of the individuals as distinguished from
            that of society as a whole. We have distinguished the parts into
            which Wealth is distributed as Wages and Rent; but it would be correct,
            indeed it is the same thing, to regard all wealth as earnings, and
            to distinguish the two kinds as Communal Earnings and Individual
            Earnings. How, then, can there be any question as to the fund from
            which society should be supported? How can it be justly supported
            in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and
        who can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings
        of the community, shall be retained for the support of the community,
        and that Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the
        individual in proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine
        law, whether we trace it through complex moral and economic relations,
        or find it in the eighth commandment. </p>
      <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
      <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99
        thereby creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society
        alone, therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
        nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty
        and fear of poverty.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">99. &quot;Whatever dispute arouses the passions of
            men, the conflict is sure to rage, not so much as to the question
            'Is it wise?' as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take
            an ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind;
            it rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably
            the deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just;
            that alone is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual
            actions and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but
            in the wider field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with
        the white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession
        of the best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not
        themselves need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate
        the whole space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest.
        We may distinguish the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated
        without use with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
      <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is
        used? Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit
        of future social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system
        of confiscating Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it
        to land-owners who, as such, earn nothing.100</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago
            a workman in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession
            of it after much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
            the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
            and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest
            court of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right
            of discovery, nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money,
            because the title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land
            upon which it fell.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
        of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
        chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to
        go upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much
        will they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use
        and not to hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents
        the full difference between its productiveness and the productiveness
        of the next best. But if the first-comers, reasoning that the next best
        land will soon be scarce and theirs will then rise in value, refuse to
        sell or to rent at that valuation, the newcomers must resort to land
        of the second grade, though the best be as yet only partly used. Consequently
        land of the first grade commands Rent before it otherwise would.</p>
      <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
        be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
        of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart
        may be made to show it: [chart]</p>
      <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land
        in securing more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor
        force, a rush is made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that
        it is wanted, but to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their
        own pockets as soon as growing demand for land makes it valuable.101
        We may, for illustration, suppose that all the remainder of the second
        space and the whole of the third are thus appropriated, and note the
        effect: [chart]</p>
      <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is
        no increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for
        higher prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning
        lots in the moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But
        let more land be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different
        appearance. The new labor must either go to the space that yields but
        1, or buy or rent from owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect
        would be the same in any case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor
        force would get more than 1; the surplus of products would go to landowners
        as Rent, either directly in rent payments, or indirectly through lower
        Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical
            or continuous payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But
            actual or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized
            for the purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling
            value that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
            will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether
            Rent is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will
            be the capitalization of its present or prospective power of producing
            Rent. In fact, much the larger proportion of laud that has a selling
            value is wholly or partly unused, producing no Rent at all, or less
            than it would if fully used. This condition is expressed in the chart
            by the blue color.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial

            including those of collecting the rents, and on the other for its
            mineral wealth, its capabilities of development for any kind of business,
            and its advantages, material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes
            of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec.

        <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a
            certain number of times the current money rental, or in other words,
            a certain 'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things
            being equal, it will be the higher the more important these direct
            gratifications are, as well as the greater the chance that they and
            the money income afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id.,
            note.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality
            inhering in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession
            of a thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it
            or for its use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is
            purely relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining
            things for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to
            value, for nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying
            some physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or
            whim. But utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves
            the reason of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things
            having some form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not
            valuable, as they are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further,
            we may see that with most of the things that have value this difficulty
            or ease of getting them, which determines value, depends on the amount
            of labor which must be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing
            them into the place, form and condition in which they are desired.
            . . Value is simply an expression of the labor required for the production
            of such a thing. But there are some things as to which this is not
            so clear. Land is not produced by labor, yet land, irrespective of
            any improvements that labor has made on it, often has value. . .
            Yet a little examination will show that such facts are but exemplifications
            of the general principle, just as the rise of a balloon and the fall
            of a stone both exemplify the universal law of gravitation. . . The
            value of everything produced by labor, from a pound of chalk or a
            paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances of a first-class
            ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent of the
            labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while the
            value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
            of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of
            the labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to
            obtain or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential
        Rent. Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space,
        but the owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor
        Wages is actually produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
      <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
        with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
        of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space
        above the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system
        which confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative
        purposes becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they
        would if land were appropriated only for use.</p>
      <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have
        as yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before
        (page 73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given
        expenditure of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when
        applied to the next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the
        poorest. Labor would not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when
        on page 73 we illustrated the appropriation of land for use only, although
        much less land is actually used. The prizes which expectation of future
        social growth dangles before men as the rewards of owning land, would
        raise demand so as to make it more than ever difficult to get land. All
        of the fourth grade would be taken up in expectation of future demand;
        and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded out to the open space
        that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence of increased
        labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
        yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages
        would then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space.
        Thus: [chart]</p>

              a drink, pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and
              traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point
              where land can be had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry
              or preemption.&quot;</font></p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the
        least that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward
        movement of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall
        below 1; but neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive
        power may increase, so long as it pays to hold land for higher values.
        Some laborers would continually be pushed back to land which increased
        productive power would have brought up in productiveness from 0 to 1,
        and by perpetual competition for work would so regulate the labor market
        that the given expenditure of labor force, however much it produced,
        could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this tendency would
        persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite increase
        in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without increase
        of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers to
        increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
        again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
        until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
        be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>

        <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political
            Economy,&quot; book ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements
            in agricultural implements which diminish the expense of cultivation,
            that they do not increase the profits of the farmer or the wages
            of his laborers, but that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition
            to the rent already paid to him, all that is saved in the expense
            of cultivation.&quot; This is true not alone of improvements in agriculture,
            but also of improvements in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
            the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies,
            cannot limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a
            fixed quantity, which human agency can neither increase nor diminish;
            but there is nevertheless a limit to the price of land, in the minimum
            required by labor and capital as the condition of engaging in production.
            If it were possible to continuously reduce wages until zero were
            reached, it would be possible to continuously increase rent until
            it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot be permanently
            reduced below the point at which laborers will consent to work and
            reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital will be
            devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
            advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to
            advance rent in countries where wages and interest are already near
            the minimum, as in countries where they are considerably above it.
            Yet that there is in all progressive countries a constant tendency
            in the speculative advance of rent to overpass the limit where production
            would cease, is, I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial
            paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>

        Thus increase of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and

        no sooner do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land
        set in, Rent rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly
        reappear. The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent

            times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical because land
            values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set it, and by
            rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
            again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
            much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
            power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates
        Rent from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
        is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
        continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should,
        actually generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase
        of productive power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated,
        tend to even greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues:
        for individuals suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.

      <p> <strong><font size="-1">IV. CONCLUSION </font></strong> </p>
      <p>In &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; after reaching his conclusion that
        command of the land which is necessary for labor is command of all the
        fruits of labor save enough to enable labor to exist, Henry George says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>So simple and so clear is this truth that to fully see it once is
          always to recognize it. There are pictures which, though looked at
          again and again, present only a confused labyrinth of lines or scroll-work &#8212; a
          landscape, trees, or something of the kind &#8212; until once attention
          is called to the fact that these things make up a face or a figure.
          This relation once recognized is always afterward clear. 111 It is
          so in this case. In the light of this truth all social facts group
          themselves in an orderly relation, and the most diverse phenomena are
          seen to spring from one great principle.</p>
        <p> <font size="-1">111. This idea of the concealed picture was graphically
            illustrated with a story by Congressman James G. Maguire, at that
            time a Judge of the Superior Court of San Francisco, in a speech
            at the Academy of Music, New York City, in 1887. In substance he
            said:</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;I was one day walking along Kearney Street in
            San Francisco, when I noticed a crowd around the show window of a
            store, looking at something inside. I took a glance myself and saw
            only a very poor picture of a very uninteresting landscape. But as
            I was turning away my eye caught the words underneath the picture,
            'Do you see the cat?' I looked again and more closely, but saw no
            cat in the picture. Then I spoke to the crowd.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Gentlemen,' I said, 'I see no cat in that picture.
            Is there a cat there?'</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Some one in the crowd replied:</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Naw, there ain't no cat there. Here's a crank
            who says he sees the cat, but nobody else can see it.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Then the crank spoke up:</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">'I tell you there is a cat there, too. It's all cat.
            What you fellows take for a landscape is just nothing more than the
            outlines of a cat. And you needn't call a man a crank either, because
            he can see more with his eyes than you can.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well,&quot; the judge continued, &quot;I looked
            very closely at the picture, and then I said to the man they called
            a crank:</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Really, sir, I cannot make out a cat. I can
            see nothing but a poor picture of a landscape.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Why, judge,' he exclaimed, 'just look at that
            bird in the air. That's the cat's ear.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">I looked, but was obliged to say:</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">'I am sorry to be so stupid, but I can't make a cat's
            ear of that bird. It is a poor bird, but not a cat's ear.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Well, then,' the crank urged, 'look at that
            twig twirled around in a circle. That's the cat's eye.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">But I couldn't make an eye of it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">'Oh, then,' said the crank a little impatiently, 'look
            at those sprouts at the foot of the tree, and the grass. They make
            the cat's claws.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;After another deliberate examination, I reported
            that they did look a little like a claw, but I couldn't connect them
            with a cat.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Once more the crank came back at me. 'Don't
            you see that limb off there? and that other limb under it? and that
            white space between? Well, that white space is the cat's tail.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;I looked again and was just on the point of
            replying that there was no cat there so far as I could see, when
            suddenly the whole cat burst upon me. There it was, sure enough,
            just as the crank had said; and the only reason that the rest of
            us couldn't see it was that we hadn't got the right point of view.
            But now that I saw it I could see nothing else in the picture. The
            landscape had disappeared and a cat had taken its place. And, do
            you know, I was never afterward able, upon looking at that picture,
            to see anything in it but the cat!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">From this story as told by Judge Maguire, has come
            the slang of the single tax agitation. To &quot;see the cat &quot; is
            to understand the single tax.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Many events subsequent to his writing have gone to prove that Henry
        George was right. Each new phase of the social problem makes it still
        more clear that the disorderly development of our civilization is explained,
        not by pressure of population, nor by the superficial relations of employers
        and employed, nor by scarcity of money, nor by the drinking habits of
        the poor, nor by individual differences in ability to produce wealth,
        nor by an incompetent or malevolent Creator, but, as he has said, by &quot;inequality
        in the ownership of land.&quot; And each new phase makes it equally clear
        that the remedy for poverty is not to be found in famine and disease
        and war, nor in strikes which are akin to war, nor in the suppression
        of strikes by force of arms, nor in the coinage of money, nor in prohibition
        or high license, nor in technical education, nor in anything else short
        of approximate equality in the ownership of land. This alone secures
        equal opportunities to produce, and full ownership by each producer of
        his own product. This is justice, this is order. And unless our civilization
        have it for a foundation, new forms of slavery will assuredly lead us
        into new forms of barbarism.112</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">112. &quot;Our primary social adjustment is a denial
            of justice. In allowing one man to own the land on which and from
            which other men must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a degree
            which increases as material progress goes on. This is the subtile
            alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from the masses
            in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that is
            instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which
            has been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political
            freedom, and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;It is this that turns the blessings of material
            progress into a curse. It is this that crowds human beings into noisome
            cellars and squalid tenement houses; that fills prisons and brothels;
            that goads men with want and consumes them with greed; that robs
            women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood; that takes from
            little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Civilization so based cannot continue. The eternal
            laws of the universe forbid it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and
            the witness that is in every soul answers, that it cannot be. It
            is something grander than Benevolence, something more august than
            Charity &#8212; it is justice herself that demands of us to right
            this wrong. justice that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; justice

      <p>Everybody nowadays is anxious to help do something
        for the poor, especially they who are on the backs of the poor; they
        will do anything that is not
              fundamental. Nobody ever dreams of giving the poor a chance to
        help themselves. The reformers in this state have passed a law prohibiting
        women
        from working
              more than eight hours in one day in certain industries &#8212; so
              much do women love to work that they must be stopped by law. If
              any benevolent
              heathen see fit to come here and do work, we send them to gaol

      <p>All these prohibitory laws are froth. You can only cure effects by curing
              the cause. Every sin and every wrong that exists in the world is the product
              of law, and you cannot cure it without curing the cause. Lawyers, as a
              class, are very stupid. What would you think of a doctor, who, finding

      <p>No man created the earth, but to a large extent
          all take from the earth a portion of it and mould it into useful things
          for the use of man. Without
                land man cannot live; without access to it man cannot labor.
        First of all, he must have the earth, and this he cannot have access
        to until
          the single
                tax is applied. It has been proven by the history of the human
          race that the single tax does work, and that it will work as its advocates
          claim.
                For instance, man turned from Europe, filled with a population
          of the poor,
                and discovered the great continent of America. Here, when he
        could not get profitable employment, he went on the free land and worked
        for
          himself,
                and in those early days there were no problems of poverty, no
        wonderfully rich and no extremely poor &#8212; because there was cheap land. Men could
                go to work for themselves, and thus take the surplus off the labor market.
                There were no beggars in the early days. It was only when the landlord
                got in his work &#8212; when the earth monopoly was complete &#8212; that
            the great mass of men had to look to a boss for a job.</p>

  <div style="text-align: center;">

      help the poor when the earth is monopolized. Men must live from the earth,
      they must till the soil,
            dig the coal and iron and cut down the forest. Wise men know it,
      and cunning men know it, and so a few have reached out their hands and
      grasped the
            earth; and they say, &quot;These mines of coal and iron, which it
            took nature ages and ages to store, belong to me; and no man can

      <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had
        the pleasure of making her acquaintance, because she lives in a lunatic
        asylum, which does not happen
                to be on my visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent
        from birth. She is well taken care of, because her father left her when
        he
                died the income of a large farm on the outskirts of a city. The
        city has since grown and the land is now worth, at conservative estimate,
                about twenty million dollars. It is covered with office buildings,
        and
                the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent by the
        woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good health,
        so she
                may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
              this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million
              dollars. And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation,
              which would he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society
              which compels thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order
              to pay her the income of twenty million dollars?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it
        easy to see that she is not entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns.
              But how about all the other people who have bought up and are holding
              for speculation the most desirable land? The value of this land increases,
              not because of anything these owners do &#8212; not because of any useful
              service they render to the community &#8212; but purely because
              the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood and
              must
              have use of the
              land.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
              because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way.
              But it seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community
              was going to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not
              in any way useful to the community. The man may have planted trees, or
              built roads, and put in sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work,
              and for that he should be paid. But should he be paid for guessing what
              the rest of us were going to need?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences
        of this guessing game. The consequences of land speculation are tenantry
        and debt on the farms,
              and slums and luxury in the cities. A great part of the necessary
        land is held out of use, and so the value of all land continually increases,
              until the poor man can no longer own a home. The value of farm
        land also
              increases; so year by year more independent farmers are dispossessed,
              because they cannot pay interest on their mortgages. So the land
        becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where wealth
              accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with
              festering slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided
              with enormous
              fortunes, which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot
              intelligently spend. ...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy
              families, living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums. Here
              and there among these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned

      <p>Henry George called attention to this situation
        over fifty years ago. The contradiction between increasing plenty, increase
        of potential security &#8212; and
              actual want and insecurity is stated in the title of his chief
        work, Progress and Poverty. That is what his book is about. It is a record
        of
        the fact
              that as the means and appliances of civilization increase, poverty
        and insecurity also increase. It is an exploration of why millionaires
        and
              tramps multiply together. It is a prediction of why this state
        of affairs will continue; it is a prediction of the plight in which the
        nation
        finds
              itself today. At the same time it is the explanation of why this
        condition is artificial, man-made, unnecessary, and how it can be remedied.
        So I
              suggest that as a beginning of the first steps to permanent recovery
        there be a nationwide revival of interest in the writings and teachings
        of Henry
              George and that there be such an enlightenment of public opinion
        that our representatives in legislatures and public places be compelled

      of which applies to our
            present
            condition, only in a more intense degree. Nor did our people have
      to wait for the advent of technocrats to hear that the machine and the
      control
            of power make it possible to abolish poverty while actually improvements
            in the machinery of production and distribution are working in the
      opposite direction. Fifty years ago, George pointed out the same contrast.
      On the
            one hand, as he said: &quot;Productive power in such a state of civilization
            as ours is sufficient did we give it play, to so enormously increase the
            production of wealth as to give abundance to all.&quot; On the other hand,
            now, as when George wrote: &quot;The tendency of all the inventions and
            improvements so wonderfully augmenting productive power is to concentrate
            enormous wealth in the hands of a few, to make the condition of the many
            more hopeless . . . Without a single exception I can think of, the effect
            of all modern industrial improvements is to production upon a large scale,
            to the minute division of labor, to the giving of large capital an overpowering
            advantage . . . The tendency of the machine is in everything not merely
            to place it out of the power of the workman to become his own employer,
            but to reduce him to the position of a mere feeder or attendant; to dispense
            with judgment, skill and brains . . . He has no more control of the conditions
            that give him employment than has the passenger in the railway train over
            the motion of the train.&quot; And yet machine and scientific technology
            contains in itself the possibility of the complete abolition of want
            and poverty. What is the trouble? ... <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">read the whole speech</a></div>

      <blockquote>
        <p>&#8220;Christ knew better than we that 'No man having put his hand
          to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God;' nor is
          many man doing his duty who shrinks and is faithless to his fellow-men.
          Now a word more about Abolitionists and new ideas in Government, whatever
          they may be: We are all called Abolitionists now who desire any restriction
          of slavery or believe that the system is wrong, as I have declared
          for years. We are called so, not to help out a peaceful solution, but
          in derision, to abase us, and enable the defamers to make successful
          combinations against us. I never was much annoyed by these, less now
          than ever. I favor the best plan to restrict the extension of slavery
          peacefully, and fully believe that we must reach some plan that will
          do it, and provide for some method of final extinction of the evil,
          before we can have permanent peace on the subject. On other questions
          there is ample room for reform when the time comes; but now it would
          be folly to think that we could undertake more than we have on hand.<strong> But
          when slavery is over with and settled, men should never rest content
          while oppressions, wrongs, and iniquities are in force against them.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&#8220;The land, the earth that God gave to man for his home,
            his sustenance, and support, should never be the possession of any
            man, corporation, society, or unfriendly Government, any more than
            the air or the water, if as much. An individual company or enterprise
            requiring land should hold no more in their own right than is needed
            for their home and sustenance, and never more than they have in actual
            use in the prudent management of their legitimate business, and this
            much should not be permitted when it creates an exclusive monopoly.
            All that is not so used should be held for the free use of every
            family to make homesteads, and to hold them as long as they are so
            occupied.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&#8220;A reform like this will be worked out some time in
            the future. The idle talk of foolish men, that is so common now,
            on 'Abolitionists, agitators, and disturbers of the peace,' will
            find its way against it, with whatever force it may possess, and
            as strongly promoted and carried on as it can be by land monopolists,
            grasping landlords, and the titled and untitled senseless enemies

      <blockquote>
        <p> In the beginning, the commons was everywhere. Humans and other animals
          roamed around it, hunting and gathering. Like other species, we had
          territories, but these were tribal, not individual. ...</p>
        <p>Why did this happen? <strong>There are many explanations. One is that
            welfare kept the poor poor; this was argued by Charles Murray in
            his 1984 book <em>Losing
          Ground</em>. Welfare, he contended, encouraged single mothers to remain
          unmarried, increased the incidence of out-of-wedlock births, and created
          a parasitic underclass. In other words, Murray (and others) blamed
          victims or particular policies for perpetuating poverty, but paid scant
          attention to why poverty exists in the first place.</strong></p>
        <p>There are, of course, many roots, but my own hypothesis is this: much
          of what we label private wealth is taken from, or coproduced with,
          the commons. However, these takings from the commons are far from equal.
          <strong>To put it bluntly, the rich are rich because (through corporations)
          they get the lion&#8217;s share of common wealth; the poor are poor
          because they get very little.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Another way to say this is that, just as water flows downhill
            to the sea, so money flows uphill to property.</strong> Capitalism by its very design
          maximizes returns to existing wealth owners. It benefits, in particular,
          those who own stock when a successful company is young; they can receive
          hundreds, even thousands of times their initial investments when the
          company matures. Moreover, once such stockholders accumulate wealth,
          they can increase it through reinvestment, pass it on to their heirs,
          and use their inevitable influence over politicians to gain extra advantages &#8212; witness
          the steady lowering of taxes on capital gains, dividends, and inheritances.
          On top of this, in the last few decades, has been the phenomenon called
          globalization. The whole point of globalization is to increase the
          return to capital by enabling its owners to find the lowest costs on
          the planet. Hence the stagnation at the bottom alongside the surging
          wealth at the top. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

            One
                1993 study concludes that "when the full range of costs of
                transportation are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the
                American public a total of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. This is

                of this activity is consumption and not production, it weakens
                America's world economic position and precludes reinvestment in more
                productive areas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Because of the way
                in which we have encouraged

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Up to recently we have proceeded from a premise that poverty is a consequence
        of multiple evils:</div>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">  lack of education restricting job opportunities;</div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">  poor housing which stultified home life
          and suppressed initiative;</div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">  fragile family relationships which distorted
          personality development.</div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
              <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div style="text-align: left;">The logic of this approach suggested that each of these causes be attacked
                    one by one. Hence a housing program to transform living conditions, improved
                    educational facilities to furnish tools for better job opportunities, and
                    family counseling to create better personal adjustments were designed.
                In combination these measures were intended to remove the causes of poverty.</div>
              </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">While none of these remedies in itself is unsound, all have a fatal disadvantage.
            ... </div>
          </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">In addition to the absence of coordination and sufficiency, the programs
                  of the past all have another common failing -- they are indirect. Each
          seeks to solve poverty by first solving something else.</div>
          </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most
                  effective -- the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now
            widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income. ... </div>
          </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">Our nation's adjustment to a new mode of thinking will be facilitated
                  if we realize that for nearly forty years two groups in our society
              have already been enjoying a guaranteed income. Indeed, it is a symptom
              of our
                  confused social values that these two groups turn out to be the richest
                  and the poorest. The wealthy who own securities have always had an
              assured income; and their polar opposite, the relief client, has been guaranteed
          an income, however miniscule, through welfare benefits. ...</div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion,
                        as we talk about &quot;Where
                            do we go from here,&quot; that we honestly face the fact that the Movement
                            must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American
                            society. There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must
                            ask the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And
                            when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about
                            the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you
                            ask that
                            question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I'm simply
                            saying that more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about
                            the whole society. We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars
                            in life's
                            market place. But one day we must come to see that an edifice which
                            produces beggars needs restructuring. It means that questions must
                            be raised. You

    <p>      Thomas Flavin, writing in <a href="http://www.knowledgerush.com/pg/etext96/bti1010.txt">The
      Iconoclast, 1897</a> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Now, it is quite true that all taxes of whatever nature are paid out
        of the products of labor. But must they be for that reason a tax on labor
        products. Let us see. </p>
      <p>I suppose you won't deny that a unit of labor applies to different kinds
        of land will give very different results. Suppose that a unit of labor
        produces on A's land 4, on B's 3, on C's 2 and on D's 1. A's land is
        the most, and D's is the least, productive land in use in the community
        to which they belong. B's and C's represent intermediate grades. Suppose
        each occupies the best land that was open to him when he entered into
        possession. Now, B, and C, and D have just as good a right to the use
        of the best land as A had. </p>
      <p>Manifestly then, if this be the whole story, there cannot be equality
        of opportunity where a unit of labor produces such different results,
        all other things being equal except the land. </p>
      <p>How is this equality to be secured? There is but one possible way. Each
        must surrender for the common use of all, himself included, whatever
        advantages accrues to him from the possession of land superior to that
        which falls to the lot of him who occupies the poorest. </p>
      <p>In the case stated, what the unit of labor produces for D, is what it
        should produce for A, B and C, if these are not to have an advantage
        of natural opportunity over D. </p>
      <p>Hence equity is secured when A pays 3, D, 2 and C, 1 into a common fund
        for the common use of all--to be expended, say in digging a well, making
        a road or bridge, building a school, or other public utility. </p>
      <p>Is it not manifest that here the tax which A, B and C pay into a common
        fund, and from which D is exempt, is not a tax on their labor products
        (though paid out of them) but a tax on the superior advantage which they
        enjoy over D, and to which D has just as good a right as any of them. </p>
      <p>The result of this arrangement is that each takes up as much of the
        best land open to him as he can put to gainful use, and what he cannot
        so use he leaves open for the next. Moreover, he is at no disadvantage
        with the rest who have come in ahead of him, for they provide for him,
        in proportion to their respective advantages, those public utilities
        which invariably arise wherever men live in communities. Of course he
        will in turn hold to those who come later the same relation that those
        who came earlier held to him. </p>
      <p>Suppose now that taxes had been levied on labor products instead of
        land; all that any land-holder would have to do to avoid the tax is to
        produce little or nothing. He could just squat on his land, neither using
        it himself nor letting others use it, but he would not stop at this,
        for he would grab to the last acre all that he could possibly get hold
        of. Each of the others would do the same in turn, with the sure result
        that by and by, E, F and G would find no land left for them on which
        they might make a living. </p>
      <p>So they would have to hire their labor to those who had already monopolized
        the land, or else buy or rent a piece of land from them. Behold now the
        devil of landlordism getting his hoof on God's handiwork! Exit justice,
        freedom, social peace and plenty. Enter robbery, slavery, social discontent,
        consuming grief, riotous but unearned wealth, degrading pauperism, crime
        breeding, want, the beggar's whine, and the tyrant's iron heel. </p>
      <p>And how did it all come about? By the simple expedient of taxing labor
        products in order that precious landlordism might laugh and grow fat
        on the bovine stupidity of the community that contributes its own land
        values toward its own enslavement! </p>
      <p>And yet men vacuously ask, &quot;What difference does it make?&quot; </p>
      <p>O tempora! O mores! To be as plain as is necessary, it makes this four-fold
        difference. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, it robs the community of its land values; </li>
        <li>second, it robs labor of its wages in the name of taxation; </li>
        <li>third, it sustains and fosters landlordism, a most conspicuously
          damnable difference; </li>
        <li>fourth, it exhibits willing workers in enforced idleness; beholding
          their families in want on the one hand, and unused land that would
          yield them abundance on the other. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This last is a difference that cries to heaven for vengeance, and if
        it does not always cry in vain, will W. C. Brann be able to draw his
        robe close around him and with a good conscience exclaim, &quot;It's
        none of my fault; I am not my brother's keeper.&quot;</p>

        <div style="text-align: left;"> &quot;Political economists have insisted
          much on the small matters that affect the value of labor. By far the
          most important is the mode
            in which the land is distributed. Wherever there is a free soil,
          labor maintains its value. Wherever the soil is in the hands of a
          few proprietors,
            or tied up by entails, labor necessarily undergoes depreciation.
          In fact, it is the disposition of the land that determines the value
          of
            labor. If men could get the land to labor on, they would manufacture
            only for a remuneration that afforded more profit than God has attached
            to the cultivation of the earth. Where they cannot get the land to
          labor on, they are starved into working for a bare subsistence.&quot; [Patrick

              for that poor dole, get what our Father provided for her? Is He
              so niggard? If not, what is it, who is it, that stands, between
              such children and our Father's bounty? If it be an institution,
              is it not our duty to God and to our neighbor to rest not till
              we destroy it? If it be a man, were it not better for him that
              a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the
              depths of the sea? &#8212; The Reduction to Iniquity (a reply to

            <p>WE are so accustomed to poverty that even in the most advanced
              countries we regard it as the natural lot of the great masses of
              the people; that we take it as a matter of course that even in
              our highest civilization large classes should want the necessaries
              of healthful life, and the vast majority should only get a poor
              and pinched living by the hardest toil. There are professors of
              political economy who teach that this condition of things is the
              result of social laws of which it is idle to complain! There are
              ministers of religion who preach that this is the condition which
              an all-wise, all-powerful Creator intended for His children! If
              an architect were to build a theater so that not more than one-tenth
              of the audience could see and hear, we should call him a bungler
              and a botcher. If a man were to give a feast and provide so little
              food that nine-tenths of his guests must go away hungry, we should
              call him a fool, or worse. Yet so accustomed are we to poverty,
              that even the preachers of what passes for Christianity tell us
              that the great Architect of the Universe, to whose infinite skill
              all nature testifies, has made such a botch job of this world that
              the vast majority of the human creatures whom He has called into
              it are condemned by the conditions he has imposed to want, suffering,
              and brutalizing toil that gives no opportunity for the development
              of mental powers &#8212; must pass their lives in a hard struggle
              to merely live! &#8212; Social Problems </p>
            <p> THAT thought on social questions is so confused and perplexed,
              that the aspirations of great bodies of men, deeply though vaguely
              conscious of injustice, are in all civilized countries being diverted
              to futile and dangerous remedies, is largely due to the fact that
              those who assume and are credited with superior knowledge of social
              and economic laws have devoted their powers, not to showing where
              the injustice lies but to hiding it; not to clearing common thought
            but to confusing it. &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PIV_Conclusion.htm">A Perplexed Philosopher (Conclusion)</a></p>
            <p> TAKE now some hard-headed businessman, who has no theories, but
              knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little village;
              in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the railroad
              will have taken the place of the stagecoach, the electric light
              of the candle; it will abound with all the machinery and improvements
              that so enormously multiply the effective power of labor. Will,
            in ten years, interest be any higher?&quot;</p>
            <p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be
              easier for a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent
              living?&quot;</p>
            <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not
              be any higher; on the contrary, all the chances are that they will
              be lower; it will not be easier for the mere laborer to make an
              independent living; the chances are that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot; &quot; Rent; the value
              of land. Go; get yourself a piece of ground, and hold possession.&quot;</p>
            <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need
              do nothing more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may
              lie around like the lazzaroni of Naples or the leperos of Mexico:
              you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole in the ground; and without
              doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota to the wealth
              of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city

            <p>THERE may be disputes as to whether there is yet a science of

              merit the title of science. But among those who recognize that
              the world we live in is in all its spheres governed by law, there
              can be no dispute as to the possibility of such a science. &#8212; The

              and of motion. Would we make social life healthy and happy, we
              must discover those laws, and seek our ends in accordance with

            <p> THE general subjection of the many to the few, which we meet
              with wherever society has reached a certain development, has resulted
              from the appropriation of land as individual property. It is the
              ownership of the soil that everywhere gives the ownership of the
              men that live upon it. It is slavery of this kind to which the
              enduring pyramids and the colossal monuments of Egypt yet bear
              witness, and of the institution of which we have, perhaps, a vague
              tradition in the biblical story of the famine during which the
              Pharaoh purchased up the lands of the people. It was slavery of
              this kind to which, in the twilight of history, the conquerors
              of Greece reduced the original inhabitants of that peninsula, transforming
              them into helots by making them pay rent for their lands. It was
              the growth of the latifundia, or great landed estates, which transmuted
              the population of ancient Italy from a race of hardy husbandmen,
              whose robust virtues conquered the world, into a race of cringing
              bondsmen; it was the appropriation of the land as the absolute
              property of their chieftains which gradually turned the descendants
              of free and equal Gallic, Teutonic and Hunnish warriors into colonii
              and villains, and which changed the independent burghers of Sclavonic
              village communities into the boors of Russia and the serfs of Poland;
              which instituted the feudalism of China and Japan, as well as that
              of Europe, and which made the High Chiefs of Polynesia the all
              but absolute masters of their fellows. How it came to pass that
              the Aryan shepherds and warriors who, as comparative philology
              tells us, descended from the common birth-place of the Indo-Germanic
              race into the lowlands of India, were turned into the suppliant
              and cringing Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse which I have before quoted
              gives us a hint. The white parasols and the elephants mad with
              pride of the Indian Rajah are the flowers of grants of land. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
              VII, Chapter 1, Justice of the Remedy: Injustice of private property
            in land</p>
            <p>TRACE to their root the causes that are thus producing want in
              the midst of plenty, ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy
              in democracy, weakness in strength &#8212; that are giving to our
              civilization a one-sided and unstable development, and you will
              find it something which this Hebrew statesman three thousand years
              ago perceived and guarded against. Moses saw that the real cause
              of the enslavement of the masses of Egypt was, what has everywhere
              produced enslavement, the possession by a class of the land upon
              which, and from which, the whole people must live. He saw that
              to permit in land the same unqualified private ownership that by
              natural right attaches to the things produced by labor, would be
              inevitably to separate the people into the very rich and the very
              poor, inevitably to enslave labor &#8212; to make the few the masters
              of. the many, no matter what the political forms, to bring vice
              and degradation, no matter what the religion.<br>
                <br>
                And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates
                not for the need of a day, but for all the future, he sought,
                in ways suited to his times and conditions, to guard against
                this error. &#8212; Moses</p>
            <p>THE women who by the thousands are bending over their needles
              or sewing machines, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day; these
              widows straining and striving to bring up the little ones deprived
              of their natural bread-winner; the children that are growing up
              in squalor and wretchedness, under-clothed, under-fed, under-educated,
              even in this city without any place to play &#8212; growing up
              under conditions in which only a miracle can keep them pure &#8212; under
              conditions which condemn them in advance to the penitentiary or
              the brothel &#8212; they suffer, they die, because we permit them
              to be robbed, robbed of their birthright, robbed by a system which
              disinherits the vast majority of the children that come into the
              world. There is enough and to spare for them. Had they the equal
              rights in the estate which their Creator has given them, there
              would be no young girls forced to unwomanly toil to eke out a mere
              existence, no widows finding it such a bitter, bitter struggle
              to put bread in the mouths of their little children; no such misery
              and squalor as we may see here in the greatest of American cities;
              misery and squalor that are deepest in the largest and richest
              centers of our civilization today. &#8212; Thou Shalt Not Steal </p>
            <p> THE poverty to which in advancing civilization great masses of
              men are condemned, is not the freedom from distraction and temptation
              which sages have sought and philosophers have praised: it is a
              degrading and embruting slavery, that cramps the higher nature,
              dulls the finer feelings, and drives men by its pain to acts which
              the brutes would refuse. It is into this helpless, hopeless poverty,
              that crushes manhood and destroys womanhood, that robs even childhood
              of its innocence and joy, that the working classes are being driven
              by a force which acts upon them like a resistless and unpitying
              machine. The Boston collar manufacturer who pays his girls two
              cents an hour may commiserate their condition, but he, as they,
              is governed by the law of competition, and cannot pay more and
              carry on his business, for exchange is not governed by sentiment.
              And so, through all intermediate gradations, up to those who receive
              the earnings of labor without return, in the rent of land, it is
              the inexorable laws of supply and demand, a power with which the
              individual can no more quarrel or dispute than with the winds and
              the tides, that seem to press down the lower classes into the slavery
            of want.</p>
            <p>But, in reality, the cause is that which always has, and always
              must result in slavery &#8212; the monopolization by some of what
              nature has designed for all. . . . Private ownership of land is
              the nether millstone. Material progress is the upper millstone.
              Between them; with an increasing pressure, the working classes
              are being ground. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book VII,
              Chapter 2, Justice of the Remedy: Enslavement of laborers the ultimate
              result of private property in land</p>
            <p>IT is not in the relations of capital and labor; it is not in
              the pressure of population against subsistence that an explanation
              of the unequal development of our civilization is to be found.
              The great cause of inequality in the distribution of wealth is
              inequality in the ownership of land. The ownership of land is the
              great fundamental fact which ultimately determines the social,
              the political and, consequently, the intellectual and moral condition
              of a people. And it must be so. For land is the habitation of man,
              the storehouse upon which he must draw for all his needs, the material
              to which his labor must be applied for the supply of all his desires;
              for even the products of the sea cannot be taken, the light of
              the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized, without
              the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from
              it we live, to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil
              as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower of the field. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
              V, Chapter 2: The Problem Solved: The persistence of poverty amid
              advancing wealth</p>
            <p>THERE is nothing strange or inexplicable in the phenomena that
              are now perplexing the world. It is not that material progress
              is not in itself a good, it is not that nature has called into
              being children for whom she has failed to provide; it is not that
              the Creator has left on natural laws a taint of injustice at which
              even the human mind revolts, that material progress brings such
              bitter fruits. That amid our highest civilization men faint and
              die with want is not due to the niggardliness of nature, but to
              the injustice of man. Vice and misery, poverty and pauperism, are
              not the legitimate results of increase of population and industrial
              development; they only follow increase of population and industrial
              development because land is treated as private property &#8212; they
              are the direct and necessary results of the violation of the supreme
              law of justice, involved in giving to some men the exclusive possession
              of that which nature provides for all men. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
              VII, Chapter 1, Justice of the Remedy: Injustice of private property
              in land </p>
            <p> LABOR may be likened to a man who as he carries home his earnings
              is waylaid by a series of robbers. One demands this much, and another
              that much, but last of all stands one who demands all that is left,
              save just enough to enable the victim to maintain life and come
              forth next day to work. So long as this last robber remains, what
              will it benefit such a man to drive off any or all of the other
            robbers?</p>
            <p>Such is the situation of labor today throughout the civilized
              world. And the robber that takes all that is left, is private property
              in land. Improvement, no matter how great, and reform, no matter
              how beneficial in itself, cannot help that class who, deprived
              of all right to the use of the material elements, have only the
              power to labor &#8212; a power as useless in itself as a sail without
              wind, a pump without water, or a saddle without a horse. &#8212; Protection
              or Free Trade &#8212; Chapter 25: The Robber That Takes All That
              Is Left - econlib | abridged</p>
            <p>THERE is but one way to remove an evil &#8212; and that is, to
              remove its cause. Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages
              are forced down while productive power grows, because land, which
              is the source of all wealth and the field of all labor, is monopolized.
              To extirpate poverty, to make wages what justice commands they
              should be, the full earnings of the laborer, we must therefore
              substitute for the individual ownership of land a common ownership.
              Nothing else will go to the cause of the evil &#8212; in nothing
              else is there the slightest hope. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
              VI, Chapter 2, The Remedy: The True Remedy</p>
            <p> BUT is there not some line the recognition of which will enable
              us to say with something like scientific precision that this man
              is rich and that man is poor; some line of possession which will
              enable us truly to distinguish between rich and poor in all places
              and conditions of society; a line of the natural mean or normal
              possession, below which in varying degrees is poverty, and above
              which in varying degrees is wealthiness? It seems to me that there
              must be. And if we stop to think of it, we may see that there is.
              If we set aside for the moment the narrower economic meaning of
              service, by which direct service is conveniently distinguished
              from the indirect service embodied in wealth, we may resolve all
              the things which directly or indirectly satisfy human desire into
              one term service, just as we resolve fractions into a common denominator.
              Now is there not a natural or normal line of the possession or
              enjoyment of service? Clearly there is. It is that of equality
              between giving and receiving. This is the equilibrium which Confucius
              expressed in the golden word of his teaching that in English we
              translate into &quot;reciprocity.&quot; Naturally the services
              which a member of a human society is entitled to receive from other
              members are the equivalents of those he renders to others. Here
              is the normal line from which what we call wealthiness and what
              we call poverty take their start. He who can command more service
              than he need render, is rich. He is poor, who can command less
              service than he does render or is willing to render: for in our
              civilization of today we must take note of the monstrous fact that
              men willing to work cannot always find opportunity to work. The
              one has more than he ought to have; the other has less. Rich and
              poor are thus correlatives of each other; the existence of a class
              of rich involves the existence of a class of poor, and the reverse;
              and abnormal luxury on the one side and abnormal want on the other
              have a relation of necessary sequence. To put this relation into
              terms of morals, the rich are the robbers, since they are at least
              sharers in the proceeds of robbery; and the poor are the robbed.
              This is the reason, I take it, why Christ, Who was not really a
              man of such reckless speech as some Christians deem Him to have
              been, always expressed sympathy with the poor and repugnance of
              the rich. In His philosophy it was better even to be robbed than
              to rob. In the kingdom of right doing which He preached, rich and
              poor would be impossible, because rich and poor in the true sense
              are the results of wrong-doing. And when He said, &quot;It is easier
              for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich
              man to enter the kingdom of heaven,&quot; He simply put in the
              emphatic form of Eastern metaphor a statement of fact as coldly
              true as the statement that two parallel lines can never meet. Injustice
              cannot live where justice rules, and even if the man himself might
              get through, his riches &#8212; his power of compelling service
              without rendering service &#8212; must of necessity be left behind.
              If there can be no poor in the kingdom of heaven, clearly there
              can be no rich. And so it is utterly impossible in this, or in
              any other conceivable world, to abolish unjust poverty, without
              at the same time abolishing unjust possessions. This is a hard
              word to the softly amiable philanthropists, who, to speak metaphorically,
              would like to get on the good side of God without angering the
              devil. But it is a true word nevertheless. &#8212; The Science

IT is as bad for a man to think that he can know nothing as to think he knows
all. There are things which it is given to all possessing reason to know, if
they will but use that reason. And some things it may be there are, that &#8212; as
was said by one whom the learning of the time sneered at, and the high priests
persecuted, and polite society, speaking through the voice of those who knew
not what they did, crucified &#8212; are hidden from the wise and prudent and

THAT thought on social questions is so confused and perplexed, that the aspirations
of great bodies of men, deeply though vaguely conscious of injustice, are in
all civilized countries being diverted to futile and dangerous remedies, is largely
due to the fact that those who assume and are credited with superior knowledge
of social and economic laws have devoted their powers, not to showing where the
injustice lies but to hiding it; not to clearing common thought but to confusing
it. &#8212; <em><a href="../HG/APP/PIV_Conclusion.htm">A Perplexed Philosopher</a></em><a href="APP/PIV_Conclusion.htm"> (Conclusion)<br>

POLITICAL economy is the simplest of the sciences. It is but the intellectual
recognition, as related to social life, of laws which in their moral aspect men
instinctively recognize, and which are embodied in the simple teachings of him
whom the common people heard gladly. But, like Christianity, political economy
has been warped by institutions which, denying the equality and brotherhood of
man, have enlisted authority, silenced objection, and ingrained themselves in
custom and habit of thought. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, Chapter
