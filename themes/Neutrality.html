      <small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
      <small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
      a case
      for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
      logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
      follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
      principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
      the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
      one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
      is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
      important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
      efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
      because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
      for taxing land has two main parts. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
      on land
      would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
      report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
      shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
      in the Appendix.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
      taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
      reasons
      why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
      world peace.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
      argument for
      taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
      offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
      rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
      price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
      land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
      increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
      become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
      land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
      </strong><br>
      <small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
      on
      land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
      the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
      erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
      because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
      collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
      <small>.</small></strong><br>
      <small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
      that the
      return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
      rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
      what land
      is. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small><strong>Thus there is no excess burden of a tax on
      land.&nbsp; A tax on land is &#8216;neutral&#8217;. ... </strong></small><strong><br>
      </strong><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>To summarize: If land is
      subject to a tax or combination of taxes with
      a present value that is independent of how the land is used, and if
      potential investors are confident that the magnitude of the tax will
      not exceed the value of using the land over the life of potential
      invest&shy;ments, then a tax on land has no excess burden; it is
      neutral. </small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing Land is Better Than
      Neutral</span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The analysis above explained how a tax on land can be &#8216;neutral&#8217;,
      that
      is, how such a tax can have no excess burden.&nbsp; In fact, taxing
      land is better than neutral; it improves economic efficiency compared
      to the no-tax situation.&nbsp; This section explains how.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Compensation for private activities that increase land values is
      more
      like a rebate of a land tax than a tax itself, but it nicely
      complements a system of taxes for activities that reduce land
      values.&nbsp; They belong together in a discussion of how a land tax
      can be better than neutral.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Another way in which a tax on land can be better than neutral is
      that
      it can ameliorate imperfections in lending markets.&nbsp; Because
      capital markets are not perfect, people vary with respect to the
      discount rate that they apply to future taxes.&nbsp; The lower the
      discount rate, the higher will be the present value that a person
      assigns to future land tax payments.&nbsp; This means that an increase
      in taxes on land will lower the bid prices of those with low discount
      rates by more than it lowers the bid prices of those with high discount
      rates.&nbsp; Thus an increase in taxes on land will tend to shift land
      from people with low discount rates to people with high discount
      rates.&nbsp; Since people with high discount rates get greater returns
      from their assets, this increases economic output.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The last way in which a tax on land can be better than neutral
      is that
      it can reduce inefficiency associated with land speculation.&nbsp;
      If everyone had the same view as to what the future held, then there
      would be no possibility of making speculative gains.&nbsp; But people
      differ in their views about the future, creating opportunities for
      people to engage in speculations that they believe will be
      profitable.&nbsp; For speculations in widely traded standardized
      commodities, it is not necessary to own the commodity to speculate; one
      can speculate through futures contracts.&nbsp; With land however, while
      there are some rudimentary futures contracts, these are available in
      only a few places and do not reflect the individual variations in land
      values that arise because of land&#8217;s locational fixity.&nbsp; Therefore
      most of the speculations that people might wish to make with respect to
      land require that the speculators own land for the duration of the
      speculation. ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

      <p><strong>Abstract<br>
        </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
        by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes
        on wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall
        income; it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or
        corporation; it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise.
        There is ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it
        has created, as well as to that which no individual or party has earned.
        Analysis increasingly makes clear that economic rent in all its forms
        is far larger than official government figures indicate; in fact it is
        likely sufficient to supplant all current taxes on labor and capital
        (wages and interest) which are acknowledged to have so many negative
        effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations by taxing
        its various bases actually can foster economic performance and yield
        other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
        Such a tax is essentially painless. ... </p>
      <p><strong>Tax neutrality</strong> refers to the influence (or absence
        of such) that any particular design has on economic behavior. Typically
        taxes are perceived as a damp on economic activity &#8212; taxing income
        reduces the incentive to work, taxing sales discourages retail transactions,
        and taxing savings reduces the propensity to save. The more a tax is
        perceived to be neutral the less the identifiable distortions it imposes
        on the economy. The common assumption of most tax theorists is that all
        taxes impose distortions; it's simply a matter of which ones are least
        burdensome to economic health. A tax which imposes no distortions is
        ideally best. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>One must begin a
      discussion by recognizing that governments,
      constitutionally speaking, have two means by which to effectuate public
      policy, conventionally known as tax powers and police powers.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1 </span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
      primary purpose of taxing power historically has been to raise the
      necessary revenue to support government functions as defined by the
      electorate through its chosen representatives</span>. Many students of
      government argue that this should be its only purpose. President
      Reagan, for example, reflected this view of taxation when he stated in
      1981 that "the taxing power of the government must be used to provide
      for legitimate government purposes. It must not be used to regulate the
      economy or bring about social change."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> This
      view has within it the implicit view that there is a way to tax that is
      totally neutral in its influence on economic behavior, something which
      has not always been understood or agreed to. Taxes have always been
      used to facilitate socioeconomic policies, and in recent years have
      become a conscious tool of policy makers even more. One recent study
      notes that in the state of Washington, for example, 222 of the 378
      identifiable tax breaks for special purposes have been enacted since
      1970; the state of Oregon, similarly, has witnessed 288.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> But
      whether using taxing powers to facilitate other purposes is a wise and
      efficient approach needs to be more carefully considered, and there has
      been too little discussion of this issue in contemporary scholarship or
      political life. Furthermore, only recently has it been possible to
      understand the possibility of tax neutrality.</small></div>

      expenditures are special provisions in the tax code, any tax code, that
      forgo the collection of certain revenues with the intent that their
      retention by taxpayers will foster public purposes better than through

      Because a tax on &#8220;land&#8221; broadly defined is inelastic, i.e., has a fixed
      supply, any tax on this base is completely capitalized in the market
      price of the land itself. It is, in effect, a tax on the land rent, or
      a recapture of the land rent by government in the name of society, just

      tax on rent will lead to no
      distortions or economic inefficiencies. Why not?&nbsp; Because a tax on
      pure
      economic rent does not change anyone's economic behavior. Demanders are
      unaffected because their price is unchanged. The behavior of suppliers
      is unaffected because the supply of land is fixed and cannot react.
      Hence, the economy operates after the tax exactly as it did before the
      tax--with no distortions or inefficiencies arising as a result of the
      land tax." P. Samuelson and W. D. Nordhaus, Economics, 16th ed., p. 250.

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      <small>A land tax is efficient because there is no economic distortion
      of
      market choices as a consequence of its neutrality. This means that
      there is no wasted economic behavior in the form of excess burden or
      deadweight loss typically associated with other tax designs. As an
      example of the inefficiencies of other taxes, for example, one might
      consider the altered behavior that occurs in consequence of the
      presence of the income tax or the sales tax. This deadweight loss in
      American and British economies has been estimated to be roughly 20% of
      the national domestic product in each nation. Put differently, were
      there no deadweight loss as a result of the tax structure, the society
      would essentially be 20% more productive &#8212; and 20% richer in the

      after 20 years for the most productive tax reform, which involves
      collecting 90% of the rent of land and using the income tax as a
      residual tax. When the sales tax is used as the residual tax, the gain
      per worker is about $3,300 less.&#8221; This and other work is summarized in
&#8220;The Gains from Taxing Land,&#8221; in Geophilos, No.03(1) (Spring, 2003),
      pp. 56-60. See also Alan Durning notes that &#8220;Complying [with the
      personal income tax alone] takes Americans 5 billion hours each year.
      For every dollar raised, U.S. taxpayers spend nine cents obeying the
      law. Cheating is widespread; roughly one-fifth of income goes
      unreported.&#8221; Alan Durning and Yoram Bauman, Tax Shift: How to Help the
      Economy, Improve the Environment, and Get the Tax Man Off Our Backs,
      Seattle: Northwest Environment Watch, April, 1998. p. 17. This is
      further corroborated in Donald L. Barlett &amp; James B. Steele, The
      Great American Tax Dodge (Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 2000), where
      the authors note (p. 23) that the proportion of U.S. taxpayers
      deliberately engaged in cheating on their income taxes now approaches
&#8220;between one -third and one-half of the tax-paying population.&#8221;</small>...

    <p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">The Taxable Surplus
          of Land: Measuring, Guarding and Gathering It</a> </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxable surplus is also what you
              can tax without
      driving land into the
      wrong use.</span> It is not enough that the land supply is fixed: a tax must
      not force
      underuse or other misuse of the fixed supply. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> A great advantage of taxing rent is
      that it does not
      change the ranking of land
      uses in the eyes of the landowner.</span> Let me explain. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      In a free market, the function of rent is to sort and arrange land uses: landowners
      allocate land to those uses yielding the most net product, or rent. Economists
      have shown (and you can easily see) that this is socially advantageous: the net
      product is the excess of revenue over all costs, so land yielding the highest
      rent
      is adding its utmost to the
      national product. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      When you base your tax on the net product (or rent), the ranking of rival land
      uses
      remains the same after-tax as it was before-tax. That is,
      if use "A" yields 20%
      more rent than use "B", and a tax takes 50% of the rent, then use A still yields
      the owner 20% more after-tax than use B, and the owner still prefers use A. We
      will see below, (Section
      D), that when you tax something other than rent (say the Gross Revenue, G),
      you will drive the land into less
      intensive uses, or out of use
      altogether. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A related advantage of taxing rent
      is that you can often
      levy the tax on the land's <span style="font-style: italic;">potential </span>to
      yield rent,
      regardless of what use the owner
      actually chooses.</span> This is, indeed, a standard way of taxing rent in most
      capitalist nations. It is possible because buyers and sellers trade land based
      on their careful estimates of its maximum rent-yielding capability. The tax valuer
      observes and records these value data, and uses them to place a value on all
      comparable lands. Many books and manuals and professional journals have been
      published on the techniques used: it is a well established art, with its own
      professional
      associations, of which our
      speaker Mr. Gwartney is a leading member. <br>
&nbsp; <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Such a tax is limited to the maximum possible
      rent, and so will not exceed a landowner's ability to pay - provided he uses
      the land in the most economical manner (which is not always the most intensive
      manner). It will surely not interfere with his using the land in the best way,
      but will
      discourage using it any other way. </span> ... </small><a href="../../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">read the whole article</a></p>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Perfect Tax</strong></div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">In the final analysis, a tax should be
          evaluated according to the tenets of sound tax theory that have evolved
          over the course of recent centuries,
            and much of what has been said above is recaptured by a review of
          those principles. These measures of what is a &quot;good&quot; tax or a &quot;bad&quot; tax
            are often listed differently in textbooks, but they are largely agreed
            upon. Failure to conform to these venerable benchmarks is by itself sufficient
            cause to explain an economy's faltering &#8212; a particularly noteworthy
            example today is the city of Philadelphia which appears to have done
            everything backward! It taxes income, sales, building capital and
            even business privilege,
            the result being that its fisc is destitute.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[20]</em></strong></font> The
            principles by which to measure tax design are enumerated here so
            as to make quite clear how recapturing economic rent in the form
            of taxes &#8212; in
            all the several forms where 'land' can be identified &#8212; constitutes
            the best method of financing government services and the most advantageous
            to cities.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[21]</em></strong></font></div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">The first measure of a good tax is its neutrality.
            A neutral tax in no way alters the behavior of its partners from what
            would transpire
              were
            there no tax at all. A simple example illustrates the case: today many
            consumers will travel to alternate jurisdictions to avoid paying a sales
            tax on particular items, be they food, medication, clothing, or whatever.
            Taxes fully absorbed (&quot;capitalized&quot;) in a market price such
            as land taxes in no way distort behavior, the volume of transactions,
            or gross
          prices. They are neutral.</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">A tax should also be efficient. To be sure, efficiency has many
                meanings even in economics. But here, rather than speaking of the
                administrative
                efficiency of its collection as will be addressed below, the measure
                is whether and how much it constitutes an excess burden on the economy,
                thereby
                slowing down performance and market vitality. Many taxes, as was
                mentioned earlier, exert so much drag on market transactions that
                they are destructive,
                however much revenue is brought to government coffers. Because land
                has a fixed supply there is no excess burden at all. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></div>
