<blockquote>
  <p>In New York, in San Francisco, in Washington, Boston, Chicago, and
      St. Louis, live men who own large tracts of land which they seldom or
      never see. A resident of Rochester is said to own no less than four
      hundred farms in different States, one of which (I believe in Kentucky)
      comprises thirty-five thousand acres. Under the plantation system of
      farming and that of stock-raising on a grand scale, which are
      developing so rapidly in our new States, very much of the profits go to
      professional men and capitalists who live in distant cities.
      Corporations whose stock is held in the East or in Europe own much
      greater bodies of land, at much greater distances, than do the London
      corporations possessing landed estates in Ireland. To say nothing of
      the great land-grant railroad companies, the Standard Oil Company
      probably owns more acres of Western land than all the London companies
      put together own of Irish land. And, although landlordism in its
      grosser forms is only beginning in the United States, there is probably
      no American, wherever he may live, who cannot in his immediate vicinity
      see some instance of absentee landlordism. The tendency to
      concentration born of the new era ushered in by the application of
      steam shows itself in this way as in many others. To those who can live
      where they please, the great cities are becoming more and more
      attractive.

  Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
    of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> As I say, the man that owns
the land is the master of those
who must live on it.</b> Here is a modern instance: you who are
familiar with the history of the Scottish Church know that in the
forties there was a disruption in the church. You who have read Hugh
Miller's work on "<b><i>The Cruise of the Betsey</i></b>"
know something about it; how a great body, led by Dr. Chalmers, came
out from the Established Church and said they would set up a Free
Church. In the Established Church were a great many of the
landowners. Some of them, like the Duke of Buccleugh, owning miles
and miles of land on which no common Scotsman had a right to put his
foot, save by the Duke of Buccleugh's permission. These landowners
refused not only to allow these Free Churchmen to have ground upon
which to erect a church, but they would not let them stand on their
land and worship God. You who have read "<b><i>The Cruise of the
Betsey</i></b>" know that it is the story of a clergyman who was
obliged to make his home in a boat on that wild sea because he was
not allowed to have land enough to live on. In many places the people
had to take the sacrament with the tide coming to their
knees &#8212; many a man lost his life worshipping on the roads in rain
and snow. They were not permitted to go on Mr. Landlord's land and
worship God, and had to take to the roads. The Duke of Buccleugh
stood out for seven years compelling people to worship in the roads,
until finally relenting a little, he allowed them to worship God in a
gravel pit; whereupon they passed a resolution of thanks to His
Grace. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that is not what I wanted to
tell you. The thing that struck
me was this significant fact: As soon as the disruption occurred, the
Free Church, composed of a great many able men, at once sent a
delegation to the landlords to ask permission for Scotsmen to worship
God in Scotland and in their own way. This delegation set out for
London &#8212; they had to go to London, England, to get permission for
Scotsmen to worship God in Scotland, and in their own native home!
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that is not the most absurd
thing. In one place where they
were refused land upon which to stand and worship God, the late
landowner had died and his estate was in the hands of the trustees,
and the answer of the trustees was, that so far as they were
concerned they would exceedingly like to allow them to have a place
to put up a church to worship God, but they could not conscientiously
do it because they knew that such a course would be very displeasing
to the late Mr. Monaltie! Now this dead man had gone to heaven, let
us hope; at any rate he had gone away from this world, but lest it
might displease him men yet living could not worship God. Is it
possible for absurdity to go any further? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You may say that those Scotch
people are very absurd people, but
they are not a whit more so than we are. I read only a little while
ago of some Long Island fishermen who had been paying as rent for the
privilege of fishing there, a certain part of the catch. They paid it
because they believed that James II, a dead man centuries ago, a man
who never put his foot in America, a king who was kicked off the
English throne, had said they had to pay it, and they got up a
committee, went to the county town and searched the records. They
could not find anything in the records to show that James II had ever
ordered that they should give any of their fish to anybody, and so
they refused to pay any longer. But if they had found that James II
had really said they should they would have gone on paying. Can
anything be more absurd?&nbsp; ... <a

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_WOSC97.html">Who
Owns Southern California?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. HOLDINGS BY ALIENS&nbsp; ...
Non-resident aliens own about 75% of the "major" buildings in the L.A.
CBD west of Broadway ...</small><br>
<small>2. AMERICANS FROM OTHER STATES ... </small><small>
A second kind of holder is the out-of-state American, individual or
corporate.</small><br>
<small>3. CALIFORNIANS Many of our largest landholders also live in
California. This is partly
because the lands are here, but moreso because certain places in
California are good places to live. One of the advantages of receiving
property as opposed to labor income is it lets one choose his
residence. California ranks after New York in the number of rich
Americans (using Forbes' list) who reside here.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Also included here are California-based corporations. A corporation's
"base" refers simply to the site of its headquarters: its shareholders
are scattered around the world, and the major shareholders, who
exercise control, are effectively screened behind layers of trusts and
financial institutions, so they are impossible to identify with
certainty.</small><br>
<small>4. INSTITUTIONS</small><br>
<small>
Institutions acquire land for their operations and then it tends to
stick to them for various reasons. It is tax free, for one, so long as
they retain it (and do not use it commercially). They are not subject
to corporate raids. Thus there is no mechanism whereby the current
opportunity cost of land is felt by management. It never appears in
their budgets; they never need compete for or justify it. College
Boards are not accountable to any public body, a precedent set by
Marshall's U.S. Supreme Court in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819.</small>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">HISTORY:
THE RISE AND FALL OF FEUDALISM</span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"To
be ignorant of what happened before you were born is to be ever a
child, for what is man's lifetime without the memory of past events
woven with those of earlier times?"</span> - Cicero (106 - 43 BC),
Roman orator, statesman and man of letters
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><br>
One of the main reasons for the decline and fall of the Roman Empire
was economic. It had been eaten from within by that very malaise that
curses us today: the appropriation of the land on the part of a
powerful, politically empowered elite to the exclusion of the rest. The
result was inevitable.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Who wants to
fight for land he does not own?
Certainly not the slaves who were doing the donkey work to support the
landowners of the decaying Roman Empire.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>When the barbarian tribes began to turn into civilised nations,
they
realised that the privilege of controlling land had to be
counterweighted by extra duties like the costs of administration,
defence and the social services (education, health, hostelry etc.).</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">BALANCED FEUDALISM - GIVING AND
TAKING</span></small><br>
<small>Hence Feudalism. This social system, which lasted about seven
centuries
(far longer than either capitalism or socialism) consisted in an
exchange of services between king, nobility, the Church and the people.
Who did what?</small><br>
<br>
<small>The king was the nominal owner of the land. This provided him
with an
independent income, which allowed him (occasionally her) to govern. The
nobility were the actual occupiers of the various duchies, counties
etc. They controlled the land by taking part of the rent as
personal/family income and spending the rest in the services of
defence, administration and justice. The Church also occupied large
tracts of land, taking part of the rent for the upkeep of its
monasteries and spending the rest in the social services: education,
health, hostelry etc.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The people supported the system by working, mostly
agriculturally. For
about four weeks of the year the peasants worked either for their lord
in exchange for administration and defence costs or for the Church in
exchange for social services. 14-15 weeks of work would be enough for
the support of a medium to large family (small families were an
exception), and 10 weeks more would provide for whatever extras were
available in those days, like beer, bacon and the like. Working time
amounted to some 200 days/year, with 150 for leisure (from handicrafts
to Gothic cathedrals). There was no concept of unemployment or vagrancy.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT SO NOBLE!</span></small><br>
<small>What broke the equilibrium was the nobility. Conventional
history books
gloat over the English barons demanding "freedom" from king John by
forcing him to append his seal to the famous Magna Charta. What they
don't explain is the type of freedom demanded. It was freedom from
duty, i.e. from spending the excess rent on administration and defence.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In time, the nobility of other countries followed suit, but
administration and defence costs remained, gradually becoming the
responsibility of the king. Increasingly it was the people who had to
pay for such, by means of increasing taxation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Things deteriorated, but not too much while the social services
remained in the hands of Church bureaucracy. A dramatic slide for the
worse occurred when the king, unable to get sufficient income, had to
start selling his land to the nobility, the only people who had the
money to buy it.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT LAND GRAB</span></small><br>
<small>The trend continued. Henry VIII of England having run out of
land of
his own, confiscated Church lands while the nobility began the process
of enclosing more and more common land which forced the people either
to work in the large estates for bare subsistence or to starve outside
them.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Slavery, shown the door during the first millennium, re-entered
through
the window during the second. There exist in fact two ways of unjustly
appropriating the work of others: either considering a human being as
private property, or preventing him from accessing land and its natural
resources, forcing the landless to work for whatever conditions
dictated to them by the exclusive holders of land. Philosophically it
is possible to distinguish between the two forms of slavery. For those
at the receiving end it makes little difference.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The process of enclosure was completed towards the end of the
18th
century. The landless, expelled from the commons where they had sought
refuge, had no choice but to pour into the cities, which at the time
were experiencing the Industrial Revolution.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Conventional historians are only too ready to blame the
Industrial
Revolution for the appalling social conditions of the workers, but keep
silent about the more plausible interpretation that it was the
Industrial Revolution which had actually saved those poor wretches from
starvation, however unwittingly.</small><br>

sufficient to feed the island. But the landlords would have their rents

of any consequence."</span> - James Fintan Lalor, (1807 - 49), Irish
patriot
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The accursed social conditions of workers during the Industrial
Revolution naturally prompted many inquiries - in those days, the
connection between the enclosures and the Dickensian conditions in the
cities was much more apparent.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ORIGINAL ECONOMISTS</span></small><br>
<small>The first great inquirer was the Frenchman <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Quesnay </span>(1694-1774),
"the European Confucius" as they dubbed him, who recommended a tax on
land as a modern remedy to re-impose the old social charge on land
ownership. Another was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Turgot </span>(1727-81).
As Minister of Finance of Louis XVI he tried to abolish the
irresponsible privileges of the nobility, but they ganged up and
destroyed him instead. Even <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adam Smith</span>
(1723-90) noticed, but as he was in the pay of the Scottish Duke of
Buccleuch, he could not bite the "benefactor's" hand.</small><br>
<br>
<small>When Professor <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thorold Rogers</span>
of Oxford (1823-90) dared expose the real causes of the relentless
plunging into poverty of the English people from Henry VIII to Queen
Victoria, he lost his chair at the University of Oxford. It would not
be the last time that the vested interests tried to muzzle a seeker
after truth.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The complete picture cannot be had by perusing a single book.
One has
to glean a good number of apparently unconnected symptoms before seeing
the larger image hidden in a confusing array of smaller ones.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Europe had serfdom. America, a
younger land, saw traditional slavery instituted afresh.</span>
Why were the African slaves not sent to Europe? - because Europe was
already full of such! H.M. Government indeed began enthusiastically to
transport its "surplus" population to Australia. The land there was
"free" in the sense that the militarily weak Aborigines could be
rendered landless with a few musket shots, much as the American Indians
would a few decades later.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">NO LAND = NO HOPE</span></small><br>
<small>At the time when Don Bosco was gathering his stray waifs thrown
onto
the streets of Turin by the same policy of forced landlessness, the
blight struck the Irish potato, sole crop of the landless there. Eight
million of them, expelled from their ancestral lands for the benefit of
a couple of a hundred absentee landlords, were being rack-rented to the
point of either starvation or emigration. Meanwhile, Ireland remained a
net food exporter!</small><br>
<br>
<small>The Irish and later the Italians, both militarily weak, crossed
the
Atlantic. The British, militarily strong, and thrown out of America
three generations earlier, found their opportunity in Africa. They
enclosed the land and forced the indigenous people to work for them
exactly along the same pattern as their English and Scottish landowner
forebears had done before. But they had another problem: a surplus
industrial production that the impoverished Britons could not buy for
lack of purchasing power. So what did they do? They went to "open up"
China, Korea and Japan, which reacted with Oriental swiftness and
cunning deception, filibuster and well-struck murderous blows.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The Second German Reich was not far behind, for it had the same
problem. Forty-odd years later the insane policy would explode into the
slaughter known to this day as the Great War.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The American Civil War of 1861-65 dramatically exposed the
difference
between the two forms of slavery. The economic victors were the
militarily defeated Confederates, who found that hired labour was a
great deal cheaper than having to feed, clothe, shelter and cure slaves.</small><small>...&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>

a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
In the book of Joshua, we find that although the Promised Land is a
gift from God, it is a gift that has to be claimed. Even before the
actual conquest of the Promised Land, the Mosaic Law prescribed a
method whereby possession of land was to be rendered pleasing in God's
sight. The Canaanites' claim was forfeited by their idolatry, with
human sacrifice and temple prostitution, and by their exploitive,
monopolistic social order. By contrast, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Israel, to make good its claim,
had to institute a social order that would guard against the
desecration, pollution, and injustices of which its predecessors were
guilty, and would secure to each family and to every generation within
the Hebrew commonwealth the equal right to the use of the land, of
which the Lord was recognized as the sole absolute owner.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>They began with a census of the tribes and families before the
conquest
(Num. 26:1-51). Every tribe, excepting Levi, and within each tribe
every family, was to receive its proportionate share, according to size
(Num. 26:55-56), and ultimately, to ensure fairness, by lot (Num.
34:16-29). The actual distribution, according to these provisions, was
concluded at Shiloh (Josh. 19:51). <span style="font-weight: bold;">According
to ancient historian Josephus, the territory was not divided into
shares of equal size but of equal agricultural value. The landmarks
that protected these allotments were protected by the public and solemn
denunciation of a curse against anyone who should dishonestly tamper
with them</span> (Deut. 27:11-16; 19:14).</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As discovered again in our own
century, it is easier to devise a one-time fair apportionment of land
that it is to keep the system from falling apart. This is why the
ancient law established the Jubilee year. At the end of every fifty
years, any alienated lands -- given away, sold, or lost from unpaid
debts -- would be restored to the original families.</span> Temporary
possessors were to be compensated for any unexhausted improvements they
may have made on the land. Concentrated landownership, and the division
of society into landed and landless classes, was thereby prevented from
creeping into the system. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
Jubilee effectively took the profit out of landholding as such, leaving
no incentive for speculation. When it was observed -- and historical
records indicate that it was observed for long periods -- the Jubilee
system successfully removed the root cause of poverty from the Jewish
society.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The influence of the Jubilee idea upon <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">early
Pennsylvania colonists</span> is evidenced by the inscription on the
Liberty Bell of the biblical words enjoining the Jubilee year:
"Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants
thereof." (Lev. 25:10) The founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn,
