  Distinctive Factor of Production</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Investors
respond to high land-price by forming land-saving capital, i.e.
substituting capital for land.&nbsp; It is useful to distinguish five
forms this substitution takes (cf <a

intensification
of use of previously rentable lands, or "exploiting the intensive
margin of production".<br>
ii)<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Land-enhancing capital,
meaning capital used to improve land for a new, higher use.</span>&nbsp;
This
includes bringing marginal land into production, on remote
frontiers.&nbsp; However, that is only a small part of what it
means.&nbsp; Both country and city are marked by many edges or
"ecotones"<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">44</span>
where lower uses give way to higher uses. Each is an economic
frontier.&nbsp; Thus, land enhancing also means converting rangeland to
plowland, dryland to irrigated land, irrigated pasture to horticulture,
and furrow irrigation to drip irrigation.&nbsp; In urban growth, it
means
converting farmland or wasteland to dwelling units, low-density estates
to subdivisions, single-family detached units to garden apartments,
garden apartments to high-rise apartments, residential to commercial,
and
obsolete structures to modern ones.</small></small></div>

economists. </font></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><br>
Developing submarginal land is particularly capital-intensive, and the
payoff is notably slow.&nbsp; A generic example is reforesting land
that
is high, cold, dry and sloping, where the timber does not ripen for
over
a century.

land

This is "forcing the
future".&nbsp; It occurs because there are "</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">economies of
simultaneity</span>" in building.&nbsp; It is hardly ever economical to
add
stories to buildings one at a time.&nbsp; If you are going to build to
four stories, you have to do it all at once.&nbsp; Suppose today's
demand is high enough to justify a two-story building, but you see the
demand rising steadily over the 60-year life of the building.&nbsp; You
build a four-story building today, and absorb early losses on the upper
two stories, as an investment for future years.&nbsp; A city builds a
four-lane street, where two would do today, anticipating higher future
usage.&nbsp; It puts excess capacity in its water and sewer lines, for
future growth.&nbsp; Such examples are legion.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Economies
of simultaneity are related to <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">economies of scale</span>.&nbsp;
Building higher, taken by itself, suffers diseconomies, also known as
increasing costs.&nbsp; On the other hand, building larger, with
horizontal expansion, evinces economies of scale.&nbsp; It also
requires
more land, meaning more land rent.&nbsp; It comes into style during
periods of rent-leading capital building.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small><small>45.&nbsp; There are
"economies

    Employment, Growth And Progress On A Small Planet:
Relieving Poverty While Healing The Earth</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Net domestic
capital formation.</b> We need to get away from the disregard many
radical reformers show for the incentives for capital formation,
conservation, and maintenance. George was less insouciant than Marx
or Keynes, and he did see the merit of untaxing capital, but he had
no concern about the aggregate supply: by inference, importing
capital was as good as forming it locally, or domestically. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Incentives are needed, not just to
import capital, but to form
capital. Besides simply forming newcapital, we need incentives NOT to
squander existing capital, in the manner of the notorious Prince of
Brunei who indulges himself with his traveling harem, retinue, yachts
and racehorses; or worse, in the manner of Osama bin Laden who
indulges his passions with the jihad that not only consumes his own
capital, but destroys that of his enemies. Marxists and early
Keynesians seem to see the rich as automatically creating more
capital than can be used. They underrate the capacity of the rich for
self-indulgence, and the tendency of social standards of consumption
to rise with wealth. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marxists and Keynesians also
overrate the automaticity of domestic
American capital formation. They, and many others, still see the
U.S.A. as the overflowing fount of loans for the world. Yet, the
U.S.A. is now the world&#8217;s leading debtor nation. Those who see
the forgiveness of international debts as a means of transferring
wealth FROM the U.S.A. should give that fact some prayerful thought.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Modern conservative champions of
incentives for capital formation
err also in failing to note that it is important to use any given
aggregate of capital efficiently &#8211; as important as to create
more capital. When we speak of &#8220;any given aggregate of
capital&#8221; we are constructing a temporary mental model in which
capital is like land, i.e. fixed in supply. Here, the function of
price and the market is to get that fixed supply allocated optimally,
i.e. put to the best use. &#8220;Price,&#8221; in this case, means the
rate of interest. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">They
err even more egregiously, and tendentiously, in making their
favorite cause the exemption of &#8220;capital gains&#8221; from
taxation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I put &#8220;capital
gains&#8221; in quotes because most
capital gains are land value gains</span> (Gaffney, 1990). &#8220;Capital
gains&#8221; is one of those slippery euphemisms that P.R. people came
up with, and the media circulate, to camouflage unearned increments
as functional incentives and rewards for creating capital, and
investing it in income-creating ways.</span> It&#8217;s a way of controlling
us by corrupting the language. A tragedy of modern Georgism is how
easily its Philadelphia convention, during the first Bush
Administration, was stampeded into memorializing Congress to repeal
the capital gains tax. A convention of land speculators could have
done no worse. Most modern Georgists simply did not understand, or
seem to care to understand, how the income tax works. There has been
some progress since then; but still, they need to wake up and smell
the coffee. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Michael Hudson and Kris Feder: <a
 href="../docs/Hudson_Feder_RECGD.html">Real Estate and the Capital
Gains Debate</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Because real estate investors make much of their money by buying and
reselling existing properties, much as financial investors buy already
seasoned stocks and bonds, many real estate and stock transactions have
no new employment or direct investment effects regardless of the
capital gains incentives being offered. </span>Yet the tax code
permits real
estate investors to take their returns mainly in the form of capital
gains and declare little taxable ordinary income. FIRE sector investors
in the finance and insurance industries also have taken their income in
ever more lightly taxed forms. These tax subsidies divert effort and
ingenuity out of productive channels and into speculation on already
existing buildings and land, or already issued stocks and bonds. An
across-the-board cut in capital gains taxes would favor the FIRE sector
rather than manufacturing, steering investment money further from
active to passive investment. Far greater stimulus to productivity is
to be expected from, instead, eliminating special privileges and
closing loopholes -- while reducing taxes on payrolls, sales, and
enterprise. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If the intention is to provide
an
incentive for new direct investment, employment, and industrial
modernization, then an across-the-board capital gains tax cut is at
best a blunt policy instrument.</span> We have examined several reasons
to doubt that further cuts in capital gains taxes will have a
pronounced incentive effect on new direct investment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">49</span></small>
Capital gains tend to reward accumulation of old assets more than
production of new wealth.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><a
