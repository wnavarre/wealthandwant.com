<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tenant</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">About 31% of American households are tenants.&nbsp; The homeownership rate
has been rising, but a significant portion of that increase could have
been predicted simply as a result of the aging of the baby boom
generation (just as the crime rate went down in the 80's and 90's as
the baby boom passed through the age groups most likely to commit
certain kinds of crimes).<br>
<br>
In our largest cities, homeownership rates are much lower -- 15%, 20%,
40% -- and rents are much higher than the national average.&nbsp; People pay
corporations, real estate investment trusts, family trusts and private individuals

huge
sums
for
the
privilege
of
living
close
to
the
center
of
things. The amenities in the apartment itself may not be much more than in a
small city, but the rent bill certainly is, and it rises for reasons that don't
involve the landlord providing additional amenities.<br>
<br>
Many who rent their homes pay significant portions of their income on
rent, and have little hope of being able to save money toward a
downpayment.&nbsp; The FIRE sector has responded to this by creating
low downpayment mortgages, coupled with private mortgage insurance; by
changing the underwriting rules to allow borrowers to devote larger and
larger shares of their income to debts service; by extending mortgage
terms to 40 years; by creating interest-only mortgages.&nbsp; The
benefits of these moves have lined the pockets of companies in the FIRE
(finance, insurance and real estate) sector of the economy, and of
those who have houses to sell in popular locations, including real
estate agents who collect a 6% commission on the sales. <br>
<br>
So 2/3 of us are homeowners, and don't consider ourselves
tenants.&nbsp; We think we now have more to gain by the perpetuation of
this system than we have to lose.&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't think much about
the next generation.<br>
<br>
<strong>But among the 2/3 who are homeowners are also a lot of people who own
their own businesses, and many more who aspire to own a business of
their own.</strong>&nbsp; Let's put aside for a moment those whose business is
that of landlord.&nbsp; Some businesses can be started in the corner of
one's home, or practiced from a laptop computer anywhere.&nbsp; But
most require at least a bit of dedicated space, and often the success
of the business depends on that space being well located.&nbsp; A
doctor needs to be located close to the hospital.&nbsp; A lawyer would
usually prefer an office close to the courthouse or the central
business district.&nbsp; A restaurant needs to be where people are
during mealtimes.&nbsp; A boutique is not going to succeed on the edge
of town.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of those businesses are conducted in rented
quarters.&nbsp; And we've all seen the signs:&nbsp; "Clearance
Sale"&nbsp; "Lost our lease"&nbsp; "Under New Management" "Grand
Opening." <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Look around at the doctors, lawyers, accountants, restauranteurs,
retailers and other small business people you know.&nbsp; Now think
about whether each rents or owns the quarters in which they conduct
their business.&nbsp; Then think about the general prosperity of
each&nbsp; one &#8212; the neighborhood they live in, the schools their
children attend.&nbsp; I suspect you'll find that those whose business
is in rented quarters don't live half as well as those who own their
business site. <br>
<br>
Under our current system, we pay taxes on our income and taxes on our
sales, many of which go to provide the very services which allow the
landlord to command a higher rent without himself providing anything
more.&nbsp; Is this a great country to be a landlord in, or what? The
good news is that it is easy to correct, through a modification of the
property tax.&nbsp; Instead of taxing sales or wages or interest
income, begin to increase the tax on the value of land.&nbsp; Don't
increase the property tax on buildings -- just on land.&nbsp; By all
means decrease the rate on the buildings.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Who benefits? Everyone except those whose primary economic role is that
of "land lord."&nbsp; And even they will see benefits.<br>

Henry George:&nbsp;<a
 href="../HG/why_the_landowner_cannot_shift.html">Why The Landowner
Cannot Shift The Tax on Land Values</a> (1887)<a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html"><br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A VERY common objection to the
proposition to concentrate all taxes
on Land Values is that the landowner would add the increased tax on the
value of his land to the rent that must be paid by his tenants. It is
this notion that increased Taxation of Land Values would fall upon the
users, not upon the owners of land, that more perhaps than anything
else prevents men from seeing the far-reaching and beneficent effects
of doing away with the taxes that now fall upon labor or the products
of labor, and taking for public use those values that attach to land by
reason of the growth and progress of society. </small><br>
<br>
<small>That taxes levied upon Land Values, or, to use the
politico-economic
term, taxes levied upon rent, do not fall upon the user of land, and
cannot be transferred by the landlord to the tenant is conceded by all
economists of reputation. However much they may dispute as to other
things, there is no dispute upon this point.<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>But while the Taxation of Land Values cannot raise rents, it
would, especially in a country like this, where there is so much
valuable land unused, tend strongly to lower them. In all our cities,
and through all the country, there is much land which is not used, or
not put to its best use, because it is held at high prices by men who
do not want to, or who cannot, use it themselves, but who are holding
it in expectation of profiting by the increased value which the
growth of population will give to it in the future. Now the effect of
the Taxation of Land Values would be to compel these men to seek
tenants or purchasers. Land upon which there is no taxation even a
poor man can easily hold for higher prices, for land eats nothing.
But put heavy taxation upon it, and even a rich man will be driven to
seek purchasers or tenants, and to get them he will have to put down
the price he asks, instead of putting it up; for it is by asking
less, not by asking more, that those who have anything they are
forced to dispose of must seek customers. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><strong>...</strong> And
how groundless it is to think that landlords who have tenants could
shift a tax on Land Values upon their tenants can be readily seen
from the effect upon landlords who have no tenants. It is when
tenants seek for land, not when landlords seek for tenants, that rent
goes up.
</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> To put the matter in a form in
which it can be easily
understood, let us take two cases. The one, a country where the
available land is all in use, and the competition of tenants has
carried rents to a point at which the tenant pays the landlord all he
can possibly earn save just enough to barely live. The other, a
country where all the available land is not in use and the rent that
the landlord can get from the tenant is limited by the terms on which
the tenant can get access to unused land. How, in either case, if the
tax were imposed upon Land Values (or rent), could the landlord
compel the tenant to pay it?<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Hence a tax on Land Values,
instead of enabling the holder of
land to charge that much more for his land, gives him no power to
charge an additional penny. On the contrary, by making it more costly
to hold land idle, it tends to increase the amount of land which
owners must strive to secure tenants or purchasers for. Thus
the effect of a tax on Land Values is not to increase the rent that
the tenant must pay the owner for the use of the land, but rather to
reduce it. And since the tax must be paid out of what the land will
yield the owner, its effect would be to reduce the price for which
the land could be sold outright.&nbsp; ...<a

<p>Upton Sinclair: <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">The Consequences of Land
      Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
      Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or<strong> the society which
      compels thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her
      the income
      of twenty million dollars</strong>?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; <strong>The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.</strong></p>
  <p>This condition wrecked every empire in the history of mankind, and it is
    wrecking modern civilization. One of the first to perceive this was Henry
    George, and
      he worked out the program known as the Single Tax. Let society as a whole
    take the full rental value of land, so that no one would any longer be able
    to hold
      land out of use. So the value of land would decrease, and everyone could
    have land, and the community would have a great income to be spent for social
    ends. ...</p>
  <p><strong>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy
        families, living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums.</strong> Here and there among
        these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned what he is consuming,
        and that it has not brought him happiness, and is bringing still less to
      his children. Such men are casting about for ways to invest their money without
        breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them might be grateful to learn
      about
        this enclave plan, and to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what
      its people are doing to make possible a peaceful and joyous life, even in this
        land of bootleggers and jazz orchestras. ... <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read

<div style="text-align: left;">
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Today,
rural land monopoly has cut the
number of American farms down
below one million, about the population of Milwaukee, San Francisco, or
Columbus.&nbsp; </span>Not many votes there.&nbsp; Small farm towns on
the
King idyll have shriveled and turned into camps for migrant laborers,
few of whom vote.&nbsp; Today, the haunts of equal homeowners and
fresh-cheeked maidens are the cookie-cutter subdivisions, whither the
&#8220;reg&#8217;lar fellers&#8221; and girls have fled.&nbsp; Homes are not just equal,
but identical to the last cornice.&nbsp; These make the red states red.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>&#8220;And the people in the boxes,
send
their children to the university,<br>
Where they all fit in little boxes, and they all come out the same.&#8221;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The difference between tenants and owners is stark and
obvious.&nbsp;
There are also differences among owners.&nbsp; In poorer cities, the
&#8220;skew&#8221; of home values is much less than in richer cities.&nbsp; &#8220;Skew&#8221;
means inequality, and is measured in many ways.&nbsp; An easy way is
the ratio of the mean home value to the median value: the higher the
ratio, the greater the skew.&nbsp; In southern California, as we move
from the red interior to the blue coast, the skew rises a lot, meaning
the top values rise faster than the other values.&nbsp; Thus, in the
blue counties the homeowners are less equal to each other. Here, too,
there is a greater gap between tenants and homeowners; and there are
more tenants.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The blue counties report higher incomes per person than the red
inland
counties.&nbsp; You might think this would compensate for their higher
home values, but you&#8217;d be wrong.&nbsp; Moving from red to blue, home
values rise faster than incomes.&nbsp; The National Association of
Realtors (NAR) and its state affiliates report &#8220;Affordability Indexes&#8221;
for different cities.&nbsp; These indexes show what fraction of the
residents can afford to buy the median-priced home.&nbsp; The higher
the median income, the lower the Affordability Index.
Counter-intuitive?&nbsp; Again, that is because home values rise faster
than incomes.&nbsp; The blue counties are those with lower
affordability indexes.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>
