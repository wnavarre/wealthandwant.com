    <blockquote>
      <p>        Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to
          the bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of
          labor is the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we
          are not atheists, who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he
          has any concern in politics and legislation.</p>
      <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
        is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the
        life of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as
        you too perceive, it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed
        order. For He who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw
        and provided that with the increase of population and the development
        of industry the organization of human society into states or governments
        would become both expedient and necessary.</p>
      <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
        This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse,
        industry rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with
        growth of population and advance of civilization the functions of the
        state increase and larger and larger revenues are needed.</p>
      <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained
        civilization as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and
        become more and more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have
        foreseen this increasing need for state revenues and have made provision
        for it. That is to say: The increasing need for public revenues with
        social advance, being a natural, God-ordained need, there must be a right
        way of raising them &#8212; some way that we can truly say is the way
        intended by God. It is clear that this right way of raising public revenues
        must accord with the moral law.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and
              products of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues
              are collected &#8212; the octroi duties that surround Italian cities
              with barriers; the monstrous customs duties that hamper intercourse between
              so-called Christian states; the taxes on occupations, on earnings, on
              investments, on the building of houses, on the cultivation of fields,
              on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these be the ways God has intended
              that governments should raise the means they need? Have any of them the
              characteristics indispensable in any plan we can deem a right one?</p>
              <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs
              to the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over
              the scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase
              the price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt
              government; they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine
              industry and thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and
              enrich some by impoverishing others.</p>
              <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
              of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
              <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
              are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of
              life, that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But
              out of the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and
              out of its effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell
              and others must buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which
              denies this gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy
              and proclaims laws of national well-being utterly at variance with his
              teaching. This theory sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal
              war of hostile tariffs; it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies
              in imposing on the productions of other peoples restrictions they do
              not wish imposed on their own; and instead of the Christian doctrine
              of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
              <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more
              clearly show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not
              the way God intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
              <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues
              by a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
              to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
              <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to
              tax, the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from
              any exertion of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the
              values produced in this way being values of improvement which we would
              exempt. The value of land irrespective of improvement is the value that
              attaches to land by reason of increasing population and social progress.
              This is a value that always goes to the owner as owner, and never does
              and never can go to the user; for if the user be a different person from
              the owner he must always pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money;
              while if the user be also the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that
              he receives it, and by selling or renting the land he can, as owner,
              continue to receive it after he ceases to be a user.</p>
              <p><strong>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot
                  lessen the rewards of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in
                  any way take from the individual
              what belongs to the individual. </strong>They can take only the value that attaches
              to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to
              the community as a whole.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><font size="-1"><strong>* As to this point it may be well to
                    add that all economists are agreed that taxes on land values
                    irrespective of improvement or
                    use &#8212; or
                  what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
                  from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
                  for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
                  be shifted by him on the user. </strong>To explain in another way the reason given
                  in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
                  will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
                  as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
                  determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
                  the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
                  increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
                  cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
                  or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
                  in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
                  recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
                  cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
                Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly, by what the
                      owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation and consequently
                      of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor can earn on it beyond
                      what is necessary to life;<br>
                  2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what
                      the particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may
                      be had by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage
                      and for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
                  3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
                      in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
                      social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
                withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never be shifted
                  by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase the
                  demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding land
                  from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
                  because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
                  economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
                  were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
                  since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
                  of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
                  receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
                  demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
                  to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
                  were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
                  for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
                merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
              of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
              to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
              impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on
              thrift; it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution
              of wealth, by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please,
              without any artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public
              purposes a value that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that
              of all values is most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply
              collected, it would enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense
              with oaths, do away with temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish
              man-made crimes in themselves innocent.</p>
              <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues
              it needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and
              degree of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother
              for the nourishment of the babe.</p>
              <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere
                the need for the state arises there are no land values. The products
                of labor
              have value, but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches
              to land itself. But as increasing density of population and increasing
              elaboration of industry necessitate the organization of the state,
                with its need for revenues, value begins to attach to land. As
                population
              still increases and industry grows more elaborate, so the needs
                for public revenues increase. And at the same time and from the
                same causes land
              values increase. The connection is invariable. The value of things
                produced by labor tends to decline with social development, since
                the larger scale
              of production and the improvement of processes tend steadily to
                reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
                centers goes up
              and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
                Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared
                with the value
              of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what
                is this due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the
                populations of
              those cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public
              expenditure for streets, drains, public buildings, and all the
              many things needed
              for the health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See
              how with the growth of such cities the one thing that steadily
              increases
              in value is land; how the opening of roads, the building of railways,
              the making of any public improvement, adds to the value of land.
              Is it not clear that here is a natural law &#8212; that is to say
              a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean anything else than
              that He who ordained
              the state with its needs has in the values which attach to land
              provided the means to meet those needs? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

          <p><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land cannot
                    be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by all competent
                    economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons untrained in
                    economics. The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is that it cannot
                    limit the supply of land. Landowners are presumably, before the tax
                    is laid, charging all the rent they can get. There is nothing in a
                    tax on the rental value of land to make tenants willing to pay more
                    or to make land more difficult to hire. On the contrary, more land
                    will be on the market, because of such a tax, rather than less, since
                    the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding land out of use and unimproved
                    for mere speculation. The competition of former vacant land speculators
                    to get their land used will make land cheaper to rent rather than more
                    expensive. And since only the net rent remaining after the tax is subtracted
                    is capitalized into salable value, land will be very much cheaper to
                    buy. H.G.B.</font></p>

                          economists, have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension
                          of this point. Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced
                          that the greater cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor
                          man who is trying to save enough from his earnings to buy a piece
                          of land; for, it is said, the higher taxes on the land after it
                          is acquired, offset the lower purchase price. What such objectors
                          do not see is that even if the lower price of land does no more
                          than balance the higher tax on it, (and this overlooks, for one
                          thing, the discouragement to speculation in land), the reduction
                          or removal of other taxes is all clear gain. It is easier to save
                          in proportion as earnings and commodities are relieved of taxation.
                          It is easier to buy land, because its selling price is lower, if
                          the land is taxed. And although the land, after its purchase, continues
                          to be taxed, not only can this tax be fully paid out of the annual
                          interest on the saving in the purchase price, but also there is
                          to be reckoned the saving in taxes on buildings and other improvements
                          and in whatever other taxes are thus rendered unnecessary. H.G.B.</font></p>

        <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon

          <p><font size="-1"><strong>1. DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAXATION</strong></font></p>
          <p>Taxes are either <em>direct</em> or <em>indirect</em>; or, as they
            have been aptly described, &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;crooked.&quot; Indirect
            taxes are those that may be shifted by the first payer from himself
            to others; direct taxes are those that cannot be shifted.5</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">5. &quot;Taxes are either direct or indirect.
                A direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who,
                it is intended or desired, should pay it. Indirect taxes are
                those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and
                intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another.&quot; &#8212;<em> John
                Stuart Mill's Prin. of Pol. Ec., book v, ch. iii, sec. I.</em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">&quot;Direct taxes are those which are levied
                on the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay
                them, and which they cannot put off upon others by raising the
                prices of the taxed article.. . . Indirect taxes on the other
                hand are those which are levied on persons who expect to get
                back the amount of the tax by raising the price of the taxed
                article.&quot; &#8212; <em>Laughlin's Elements</em>, par. 249.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">Taxes are direct &quot;when the payment is made
                by the person who is intended to bear the sacrifice.&quot; Indirect

            <p><font size="-1">&quot;Indirect taxes are so called because they
                are not paid into the treasury by the person who really bears
                the burden. The payer adds the amount of the tax to the price
                of the commodity taxed, and thus the taxation is concealed under
                the increased price of some article of luxury or convenience.&quot; &#8212; <em>Thompson's
                Pol. Ec</em>., sec. 175.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The shifting of indirect taxes is accomplished by means of their
            tendency to increase the prices of commodities on which they fall.
            Their magnitude and incidence 6 are thereby disguised. It was for
            this reason that a great French economist of the last century denounced
            them as &quot;a scheme for so plucking geese as to get the most feathers
            with the least squawking.&quot;7 </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">6. Jevons defines the incidence of a tax as &quot;the
                manner in which it falls upon different classes of the population.&quot; &#8212; <em>Jevons's
                Primer</em>, sec. 96.<br />
    Sometimes called &quot;repercussion,&quot; and refers &quot;to the real as
    opposed to the nominal payment of taxes.&quot; &#8212; <em>Ely's Taxation</em>,
    p. 64.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">7. Though his language was blunt, the sentiment
                does not essentially differ from that of &quot;statesmen&quot; of
                our day who meet all the moral and economic objections to indirect
                taxation with the one reply that the people would not consent
                to pay enough or the support of government if public revenues
                were collected from them directly. This means nothing but that
                the people are actually hoodwinked by indirect taxation into
                sustaining a government that they would not support if they knew
                it was maintained at their expense; and instead of being a reason
                for continuing indirect taxation, would, if true, be one of the
                strongest of reasons for abolishing it. It is consistent neither
                with the plainest principles of democracy nor the simplest conceptions
                of morality.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Indirect taxation costs the real tax-payers much more than the government
            receives, partly because the middlemen through whose hands taxed
            commodities pass are able to exact compound profits upon the tax,8
            and partly on account of extraordinary expenses of original collection;9
            it favors corruption in government by concealing from the people
            the fact that they contribute to the support of government; and it
            tends, by obstructing production, to crush legitimate industry and
            establish monopolies.10 The questions it raises are of vastly more
            concern than is indicated by the sum total of public expenditures.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> <font size="-1">8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance
                by shoe manufacturers, enters into manufacturers' prices, and,
                together with the usual rate of profit upon that amount of investment,
                is recovered from wholesalers. The tax and the manufacturers'
                profit upon it then constitute part of the wholesale price and
                are collected from retailers. The retailers in turn collect the
                tax with all intermediate profits upon it, together with their
                usual rate of profit upon the whole, from final purchasers &#8212; the
                consumers of shoes. Thus what appears on the surface to be a
                tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination to be an
                indirect tax upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation
                of profits upon the tax considerably more than the government
                receives.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">The effect would be the same if a tax upon their
                leather output were imposed upon tanners. Tanners would add to
                the price of leather the amount of the tax, plus their usual
                rate of profit upon a like investment, and collect the whole,
                together with the cost of hides, of transportation, of tanning
                and of selling, from shoe manufacturers, who would collect with
                their profit from retailers, who would collect with their profit
                from shoe consumers. The principle applies also when taxes are
                levied upon the stock or the sales of merchants, or the money
                or credits of bankers; merchants add the tax with the usual profit
                to the prices of their goods, and bankers add it to their interest
                and discounts.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output
                of manufacturers or importers would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing
                profit, cost wholesalers $110,000; at a profit of 10 per cent
                to wholesalers it would cost retailers $121,000, and at 20 percent
                profit to retailers it would finally impose a tax burden of $145,200 &#8212; being
                45 per cent more than the government would get. Upon most commodities
                the number of profits exceeds three, so that indirect taxes may
                frequently cost as much as 100 per cent, even when imposed only
                upon what are commercially known as finished goods; when imposed
                upon materials also, the cost of collection might well run far
                above 200 percent in addition to the first cost of maintaining
                the machinery of taxation.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery
                of indirect taxes from the ultimate consumers of taxed goods
                is arbitrary. When shoe manufacturers, or tanners, or merchants
                add taxes to prices, or bankers add them to interest, it is not
                because they might do otherwise but choose to do this; it is
                because the exigencies of trade compel them. Manufacturers, merchants,
                and other tradesmen who carry on competitive businesses must
                on the average sell their goods at cost plus the ordinary rate
                of profit, or go out of business. It follows that any increase
                in cost of production tends to increase the price of products.
                Now, a tax upon the output of business men, which they must pay
                as a condition of doing their business, is as truly part of the
                cost of their output as is the price of the materials they buy
                or the wages of the men they hire. Therefore, such a tax upon
                business men tends to increase the price of their products. And
                this tendency is more or less marked as the tax is more or less
                great and competition more or less keen.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">It is true that a moderate tax upon monopolized
                products, such as trade-mark goods, proprietary medicines, patented
                articles and copyright publications is not necessarily shifted
                to consumers. The monopoly manufacturer whose prices are not
                checked by cost of production, and are therefore as a rule higher
                than competitive prices would be, may find it more profitable
                to bear the burden of a tax that leaves him some profit, by preserving
                his entire custom, than to drive off part of his custom by adding
                the tax to his usual prices. This is true also of a moderate
                import tax to the extent it falls upon goods that are more cheaply
                transported from the place of production to a foreign market
                where the import tax is imposed than to a home market where the
                goods would be free of such a tax &#8212; products, for instance,
                of a farm in Canada near to a New York town, but far away from
                any Canadian town. If the tax be less than the difference in
                the cost of transportation the producer will bear the burden
                of it; otherwise he will not. The ultimate effect would be a
                reduction in the value of the Canadian land. Examples which may

          <p> Whoever calmly reflects and candidly decides upon the merits of
            indirect taxation must reject it in all its forms. But to do that
            is to make a great stride toward accepting the single tax. For the

            <p><font size="-1">11. This is usually a stumbling block to those
                who, without much experience in economic thought, consider the
                single tax for the first time. As soon as they grasp the idea
                that taxes upon commodities shift to consumers they jump to the
                conclusion that similarly taxes upon land values would shift
                to the users. But this is a mistake, and the explanation is simple.
                Taxes upon what men produce make production more difficult and
                so tend toward scarcity in the supply, which stimulates prices;
                but taxes upon land, provided the taxes be levied in proportion
                to value, tend toward plenty in supply (meaning market supply
                of course), because they make it more difficult to hold valuable
                land idle, and so depress prices.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1">&quot;The way taxes raise prices is by increasing
                the cost of production and checking supply. But land is not a
                thing of human production, and taxes upon rent cannot check supply.
                Therefore, though a tax upon rent compels land-owners to pay
                more, it gives them no power to obtain more for the use of their
                land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of land. On
                the contrary, by compelling those who hold land on speculation
                to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land values tends
                to increase the competition between owners, and thus to reduce
                the price of land.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty, book
                viii, ch. iii, subd. i.</em></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> Sometimes this point is raised as a question
                of shifting the tax in higher rent to the tenant, and at others
                as a question of shifting it to the consumers of goods in higher
                prices. The principle is the same. Merchants cannot charge higher
                prices for goods than their competitors do, merely because they
                pay higher ground rents. A country storekeeper whose business
                lot is worth but few dollars charges as much for sugar, probably
                more, than a city grocer whose lot is worth thousands. Quality
                for quality and quantity for quantity, goods sell for about the
                same price everywhere. Differences in price are altogether in
                favor of places where land has a high value. This is due to the
                fact that the cost of getting goods to places of low land value,
                distant villages for example, is greater than to centers, which
                are places of high land value. Sometimes it is true that prices
                for some things are higher where land values are high. Tiffany's
                goods, for instance, may be more expensive than goods of the
                same quality at a store on a less expensive site. But that is
                not due to the higher land value; it is because the dealer has
                a reputation for technical knowledge and honesty (or has become
                a fad among rich people), for which his customers are willing
                to pay whether his store is on a high priced-lot or a low-priced
                one.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> Though land value has no effect upon the price
                of good, it is easier to sell goods in some locations than in
                others. Therefore, though the price and the profit of each sale
                be the same, or even less, in good locations than in poorer ones,
                aggregate receipts and aggregate profits are much greater at
                the good location. And it is out of his aggregate, and not out
                of each profit, that rent is paid, For example: A cigar store
                on a thoroughfare supplies a certain quality of cigar for fifteen
                cents. On a side street the same quality of cigar can be bought
                no cheaper. Indeed, the cigars there are likely to be poorer,
                and therefore really dearer. Yet ground rent on the thoroughfare
                is very high compared with ground rent on the sidestreet. How,
                then, can the first dealer, he who pays the high ground rent,
                afford to sell as good or better cigars for fifteen cents than
                his competitor of the low priced location? Simply because he
                is able to make so many more sales with a given outlay of labor
                and capital in a given time that his aggregate profit is greater.
                This is due to the advantage of his location, and for that advantage
                he pays a premium in higher ground rent. But that premium is
                not charged to smokers; the competing dealer of the side street
                protects them. It represents the greater ease, the lower cost,
                of doing a given volume of business upon the site for which it
                is paid; add if the state should take any of it, even the whole
                of it, in taxation, the loss would be finally borne by the owner
                of the advantage which attaches to that site &#8212; by the landlord.
                Any attempt to shift it to tenant or buyer would be promptly
                checked by the competition of neighboring but cheaper land.</font></p>

            Catechism of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of Natural
          Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>Q28. How are landlords privileged?</em><br>
            A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an &quot;old&quot; tax,
            it is a burdenless tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted
            upon their tenants; most landlords who let land and also the tenement
            houses and business blocks thereon avoid all share in the tax burden.</p>
          <p><em>Q34. Why does not an increase in ground rent tend to cause an increase
            in prices?</em><br>
            A. Usually sales increase faster proportionately than rent, thus
            reducing the ratio of rent to sales. The larger the product, the
            lower the individual costs. The larger the gross sales, the lower
            the competitive prices.</p>
          <p><em>Q38. What are the three legs of the tripos, the threefold support
            upon which the single tax rests?</em><br>
            A. They are:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>(1) The social origin of ground rent -- that the site value of land
                is a creation of the community, a public or social value.<br>(2) The non-shiftability of a land tax -- that no tax, new or old,
                on the site value of land can be recovered from the tenant or user
              by raising his rent.<br>(3) The ultimate burdenlessness of a land tax -- that the selling
                value of land, reduced as it is by the capitalized tax that is imposed
                upon it, is an untaxed value. Whatever lowers the income from land
                lowers proportionately its selling price, so that whether the established
                tax upon it has been light or heavy, it is no burden upon the new
                purchaser, who buys it at its net value and thus escapes all part
                in the tax burden which he should in justice share with those who
              now bear it all.</p>
            </blockquote>
          <p><em>Q45. Why tax $1,000 invested in a vacant lot while exempting
              $1,000 invested in New York Central stock?</em><br>
A. Because: (1) the land is made worth $1,000 and so maintained at public expense
without any contribution from the owner; (2) the $1,000 New York Central stock
adds nothing to the public expense, but a tax upon it, if collected at the source,
falls directly on the road and thence upon the public, and so adds to the cost
of living.</p>
          <p><em>Q51. Does not a land tax increase house rent or store rent?</em><br>
            A. The landlord, as a rule, exacts the full ground rent for the use
              of his land. Neither by taking three dollars nor $30 per thousand
            in taxation can land to be made worth any more for use.</p>
          <p><em>Q55. How would the single tax effect the tenant?</em><br>
            A. It would neither increase nor decrease his land rent. It would
            reduce his house rent by the amount of the house tax. ... <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

        <p>Some may wonder why anyone would own land if most of the rent is taxed
              away. One would own land for the same reason people rent land: in order
              to use it. Ownership also gives the title holder rights of possession,
              the ability to control the use of the site indefinitely.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Today there is also a speculative motive for owning land, to profit
              from the increase in its price. With most of the geo-rent tapped for
              public revenue, the speculative motive would be dampened. That would
              benefit the economy, since with a lower price of land, funds that now
              go to buy land would instead go to build more capital goods, hire more
              labor, or provide better training.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>The tax on the geo-rent would be borne by the owner, not the tenant.
              If a landlord, who was already charging what the market could bear,
              tried to pass on the tax, he would face vacancies. Some say that since
              the tax would be invisible to renters, the link between using public
              services and paying for them would be broken. But productive public
              services increase the geo-rent, so that link is there. If government
              revenue is wasted, then indeed this does not generate rent, and a land
              value tax without corresponding benefits would reduce land value. Pressure
              for a productive use of public revenue would come from the landowners
              more than from the tenants. But that is no different than the situation
              today; poor folks pay little or no income tax and no property tax,
              and typically they get government assistance. This is an argument not
              against the use of rent, but in favor of privatizing government programs.
              In the private sector, the link between ownership and control is stronger.

      <div style="text-align: left;">People are frequently most concerned about
        the fairness of a tax, which is typically measured according to both
        horizontal and vertical
              equity. Horizontal equity means that those in similar circumstances
              will bear similar burdens. Vertical equity prescribes that those
        with greater resources will pay more. Although studies have yet to show
              this, land taxes are likely the most &quot;progressive&quot; of
              any levy, as tenants bear no passed-through burden at all.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[22]</em></strong></font> Not
              only does no household or office tenant bear any tax burden, locational
              sites distant from the urban core, mostly homeowners and farmers,
              typically find their burden reduced. Vacant or underused lots in
              high value areas
              pick up the difference, employing a design that employs an alternate
              criterion of equity: taxing according to use. &quot;Paying for what
              you take and not for what you make&quot; encourages efficient consumption
              of space and resources in an automatic and non-coercive manner.
              The one-third of households that own no land are relieved of all
              taxes,
              and residential and non-residential property owners split the rest.
              Farmers, whose land is typically of inconsequential value relative
              to sites in urban areas, are likely to pay little if anything even
              if they are not already protected by other save-harmless provisions.
              By eliminating taxes on building improvements they typically enjoy
              savings just as do other businesses. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></div>

              user of land, and cannot be transferred by the landlord to the tenant
              is conceded by all economists of reputation. However much they may
              dispute as to other things, there is no dispute upon this point.
              Whatever flimsy reasons any of them may have deemed it expedient to
              give why the tax on rent should not be more resorted to, they all admit
              that the taxation of rent merely diminishes the profits of the
              landowner, cannot be shifted on the user of land, cannot add to prices,
            nor check production. ...</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The reason of this will be clear to everyone who has grasped the
              accepted theory of rent &#8212; that theory to which the name of Ricardo
              has been given, and which, as John Stuart Mill says, has but to be
              understood to be proved. And it will be clear to everyone who will
              consider a moment, even if he has never before thought of the cause
              and nature of rent. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The rent of land
              represents a return to ownership
              over and above the return which is sufficient to induce use &#8212; it
              is a premium paid for permission to use. To take, in taxation, a part
              or the whole of this premium in no way affects the incentive to use
              or the return to use; in no way diminishes the amount of land there
              is to use, or makes it more difficult to obtain it for use. </span>Thus
              there is no way in which a tax upon rent or Land Values can be
              transferred to the user. Whatever the State may demand of this
              premium simply diminishes the net amount which ownership can get for
              the use of land, or the price it can demand as purchase money, which
          is, of course, rent or the expectation of rent, capitalized.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> To put the matter in a form in
              which it can be easily
              understood, let us take two cases. The one, a country where the
              available land is all in use, and the competition of tenants has
              carried rents to a point at which the tenant pays the landlord all he
              can possibly earn save just enough to barely live. The other, a
              country where all the available land is not in use and the rent that
              the landlord can get from the tenant is limited by the terms on which
              the tenant can get access to unused land. How, in either case, if the
              tax were imposed upon Land Values (or rent), could the landlord
              compel the tenant to pay it?<strong> ...
          </strong></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But a tax on Land Values does not
              add to the cost of producing
              land. Land is not a thing of human production. Man does not produce
              land! He finds it already in existence when he comes into the world.
              Its price, therefore, is not fixed by the cost of production, but is
              always the highest price that anyone can give for the privilege of
              using a particular piece. Land, unlike things that must be constantly
              produced by labor, has no normal value based on the cost of
              production, but ranges in value from nothing at all to the enormous
              values that attach to choice sites in great cities, or to mineral
              deposits of superior richness, when the growth of population causes a
          demand for their use. </small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Hence a tax on Land Values,
              instead of enabling the holder of
              land to charge that much more for his land, gives him no power to
              charge an additional penny. On the contrary, by making it more costly
              to hold land idle, it tends to increase the amount of land which
              owners must strive to secure tenants or purchasers for. Thus
              the effect of a tax on Land Values is not to increase the rent that
              the tenant must pay the owner for the use of the land, but rather to
              reduce it. And since the tax must be paid out of what the land will
              yield the owner, its effect would be to reduce the price for which
              the land could be sold outright.

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
              terms of social justice is
          founded on two understandings: </small></p>

  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <div style="text-align: left;"><small>first, that the value of land in the
              absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
              and </small></div>
      </div>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><small>second, that increases in the rental
            value of land arising from economic development and government expenditures
            should be collected
                    by governments to finance those activities. </small></div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <div style="text-align: left;"></div>
      </div>
    </li>
    </ul>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <div style="text-align: left;"><small>What is meant
                          by "land" is the unimproved value of sites and the value
                    of extractable natural resources such as North Sea oil. </small></div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
          institutions capable of implementing a
          recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
          basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
          implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
          heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
          nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
          all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
          are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
          rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
          unimproved condition.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
          terms of economic efficiency is
          founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
          human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
          does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
          revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
          government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
          frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
          as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
          sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
          greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
          productivity.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
          the amount of tax that is due
          cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
          taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
          They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
          are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
          fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
          worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
          resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
          levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
          And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
          the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
          more detail these social justice
          and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
          for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
          potential objections are without merit. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It has sometimes been alleged that
          if site value rentals were
          taxed, the owners of sites would simply pass the taxes on to the
          users of sites. Such assertions generally come from a serious
          misunderstanding of economics. An economic understanding of payments
          for the use of land presumes that negotiations between owners of land
          and potential users, over the terms on which land is to be used, are
          conducted on the basis of each side doing as well for itself
          financially as its position permits. Owners rent land for the most
          they can get, and if one potential user is not prepared to pay what
          the land is worth, then the owner will find someone else who is
          prepared to pay that much. There are, nevertheless, two ways in which
          site value rating could result in higher payments for the use of
          land.</small></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small> One way is that there could be individuals who rent land
          for amounts less than what the market will bear. If there are such
          individuals, they would be able to raise the rents they charged, to at
          least some extent, when they were required to pay site value ratings. </small></li>
            <li><small>The second way in which higher payments for the use of
          land could come about from site value rating is that if site value
          rating is accompanied by reductions in other taxes, as it ought to be,
          then these tax reductions would make land more valuable. Where this
          occurred, rents paid for the use of land would rise. But this does not
          constitute "passing a tax on." There is no guarantee that the amounts
          by which rental values would rise would correspond to the site value
          ratings. And in any case, if land were taxed according to its full
          rental value, all of what owners of land now collect in rents would be
          collected by the government. ... <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html"><span

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We do not propose a tax upon land,
          as people who misapprehend us
          constantly say. We do not propose a tax upon land; we propose a tax
          upon land values, or what in the terminology of political economy is
          termed rent; that is to say, the value which attaches to land
          irrespective of any improvements &#8212; in or on it; that value which
          attaches to land, not by reason of anything that the user or improver
          of land does &#8212; not by reason of any individual exertion of labour,
          but by reason of the growth and improvement of the community. A tax
          that will take up what John Stuart Mill called the unearned
          increment; that is to say, that increment of wealth which comes to
          the owner of land, not as a user; that comes whether he be a resident
          or an absentee; whether he be engaged in the active business of life;
          whether he be an idiot and whether he be a child; that growth of
          value that we have seen in our own times so astonishingly great in
          this city; that has made sand lots, lying in the same condition that
          they were thousands of years ago, worth enormous sums, without anyone
          putting any exertion of labour or any expenditure of capital upon
          them. </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now, the distinction between a
          tax on land and a tax on land
          values may at first seem an idle one, but it is a most important one.
          A tax on land that is to say, a tax upon all land &#8212; would
          ultimately become a condition to the use of land; would therefore
          fall upon labour, would increase prices, and be borne by the general
          community. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But a tax on land values
          cannot fall on all land, because
          all land is not of value; it can only fall on valuable land, and on
          valuable land in proportion to its value; therefore, it can no more
          become a tax on labour than can a tax upon the value of special
          privileges of any kind. It can merely take from the individual, not
          the earnings of the individual, but that premium which, as society
          grows and improves, attaches to the use of land of superior
          quality.&nbsp; </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"

        <p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_Merits_SVT.html">The Merits of
          Site Value Taxation</a></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To a land economist, the land
          value and any building value must be
          regarded separately: each has its own economic dynamic. As to the land
          component, one must understand that the value of that site is due not
          to how the owner uses it but rather due to the activity of the whole
          neighborhood or even the region. Any value which a land parcel accrues
          above the cost of its creation is due to the accretion of what
          economists call economic rent. The word rent has a very different
          meaning than that used in everyday discourse. Since the community is
          responsible for the rise or fall in the value of a land site, or rather
          of all those in the neighborhood, any increase in the value of that
          location can be reclaimed by that community more than by the
          titleholder alone. Were it not for the accretion of land rent on a
          parcel, all land would have the same market value.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>When one looks at the value of land in any broad way, its value
          will be
          highest at the center and falls as one looks out to the frontier. The
          highest value land, that with the greatest accrued rent, is at the very
          center of the city -- usually where the commercial parcels are located.
          In the spring of 1998, one land parcel (the building was to be razed)
          of less than an acre and split in two pieces in New York City's Times
          Square was sold by Prudential Life to Disney for an estimated $240
          million,<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19</span></small>
          more than the value of all the land and buildings together in the lands
          north of the Mohawk River/Erie Canal in New York State. The highest
          value land is
          typically surrounded by a belt of residential areas, and with farmlands
          starting at the fringe. The more valuable parcels are taxed, the more
          their titleholders will find ways to recover their carrying costs. And
          it cannot affect the behavior of tenants as any change in burden is not
          passed through. In this sense,
          land value taxation fosters clustered development and reverses the
          egregious patterns of sprawl. Jessica Matthews, now with the Council on
          Foreign Relations, recently wrote a syndicated piece observing that, </small></div>
        <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><br>
          In a now familiar sequence, developers reach for the cheapest land, out
          in the cow pastures. Government is left to fill in behind with
          brand-new infrastructure -- roads, sewerage systems and schools -- paid
          for in part by those whose existing roads and schools are left to
          decline. Property values rise in a ring that marches steadily outward

          Because residential development can't meet the public bills, local
          governments compete for commercial investment with tax discounts that
          deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes then rise,
          providing an incentive for new development.

          <small>Taxing high value land parcels encourages their efficient use.
          The
          highest value parcels will then be settled at sufficient density that
          public transportation services become economically viable -- experts
          recognize that it typically takes at least 10-12 households per acre
          for this to happen.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">21</span></small> This
          both relieves dependency upon motor vehicle transportation and enhances
          the livability of communities. Taxing land alone also removes the
          penalty for titleholders who want to improve their properties. Under
          current property tax structures, one is penalized if one adds a garage,
          an extra wing of rooms, or in any way makes an upgrade. This is
          perverse: when people maintain and improve their homes and other
          buildings it is a social and economic benefit.</small></div>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
          <small>Taxing land by its value has many economic advantages. The first
          is
          that it is equitable: those who have title to the most land value will
          pay the most taxes; those who have no land pay no taxes. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Because a tax
          on land alone cannot be passed on to tenants, this means that all those
          households that do not own their own home will pay no taxes.</span>
          Nationally
          only 65 percent of households are homeowners; in New York State, it's
          only 52 percent.<small><span

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
          <small>And since we know that it is typically the wealthier element of
          the
          society that owns there is a certain fairness in this. Of those parcels
          that currently pay taxes on their real property, about half are
          homeowners, and the remainder are commercial, industrial, and
          agricultural titleholders. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Agricultural
          parcels </span>typically have very little market value because their
          location is so remote; they would have little if any tax burden. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Commercial
          parcels</span>, in contrast, are usually sited in very high value
          locations, and therefore would pay the most. A shift of taxes away from
          buildings and onto land alone typically relieves homeowners, and adds
          to the burden of high value parcels (usually in commercial cores) that
          are underused relative to their value -- fully depreciated structures,
          parking lots, drive-in banks, gas stations, fast food services, and so
          on.... <a href="../docs/Batt_Merits_SVT.html"><span

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The one kind of tax where there
          is no deadweight loss whatsoever is
          that imposed upon an base with inelastic supply. Since land and some
          other elements of nature cannot be increased in quantity resulting in a
          completely vertical supply curve, no inefficiency is incurred by such a
          tax. Consider two cases of a tax commonly found worldwide on real
          estate. Because a real property tax is actually two taxes from the
          standpoint of economic dynamics -- the tax on the land component and
          the tax on the improvement component, each is considered here as a
          separate case. In the first case, the tax on the land component alone
          is illustrated. In the other case, the tax on the improvement component
          (i.e. the building) is shown. What happens?</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The tax on land alone is completely capitalized in the market
          value of
          the land parcel and is not passed forward to the tenant. This is
          important, because when the roughly 1/3 of all American households that
          rent rather than own their own homes are removed from the burden of
          property taxation, it has the effect of making the land tax far more
          progressive. Those land parcels that do pay taxes are split between
          residential and non-residential titleholders. Even though the
          residential households are likely to constitute the overwhelming number
          of parcels in the tax base, they are likely to bear only about half the
          taxes paid, the remaining share borne largely by commercial sites.
          Agricultural parcels may in some instances represent a large area of
          land, but it is likely to be of far lower market value and represent
          less than five percent of the revenue paid. The land component of a tax
          on real property then is actually highly progressive. ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Consider now the tax on the <span style="font-style: italic;">improvement
          </span>portion of the property parcel.
          Here, depending upon the slope of the supply curve and the demand
          curve, the tax is likely to be passed forward to a greater or lesser
          extent to the tenant. Very little of it in fact is typically borne by
          the landlord. The existence of the tax on structures incurs a
          depressing effect upon the rate of investment, just like all such taxes
          with more than zero elasticity. And the greater scarcity of sites for
          rent, either commercial or residential, has the impact of driving up
          prices for their use. What is even more significant, as noted earlier,
          is that the shift of taxes off improvements and onto landsites
          encourages the use of those sites to the full extent of their
          locational value, thereby halting and even reversing the centrifugal
          forces of sprawl development. Greater investment in high value
          landsites creates greater density and proximity in the community,
          enhancing the accessibility of those sites to one another and reducing
          the need for transportation mobility.... <a

        <blockquote>
          <p>            The demand for land involves both use values and exchange
            values. People seek land because the housing built on it provides
            shelter
              and security, but they also purchase it as a store of wealth and
              a means of capital appreciation. A particularly important driver
              of real estate prices has been the speculative demand, as investors
              seek capital gains in the property market. In Australia, this has
              been such common and longstanding practice that it has been referred
              to as &#8216;the national hobby&#8217; (Sandercock, 1979). By &#8216;creaming
              off&#8217; a part of this potential capital gain, a higher uniform
              rate of land tax would act as a disincentive to this property speculation,
              and could therefore be expected to exert a downward influence on
              property prices. Georgists have always been emphatic that land
              taxes are different from other taxes in this respect &#8211; they
              depress prices because they reduce demand. So the usual fears that
              a tax will be &#8216;passed on&#8217; to customers (such as housing
              tenants, in this case) do not apply.4 By making land less attractive
              as an item to be purchased in the hope of making capital gains,
              land tax can therefore be an important check on the inflationary
              process. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole

            Parts of the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985
study &#8220;Who Pays New York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><br>
            Analysis of &#8220;Who Pays?&#8221;</p>
          <p>Sufficient time has passed, I think, that I can now freely make
            observations on some work of the Tax Study Commission, particularly
            both since I have more expertise on tax policy and because the Commission's
            work really reflected the views of Professor Pomp and no one else.
            Only one paper touched on the real property tax, and only in a few
            passages. It was originally contracted to University of Missouri
            Professor Donald Phares, and this draft was then rewritten by the
            Commission (i. e., Rick Pomp) to be released as a working paper. &#8220;Who
            Pays New York Taxes?&#8221; is accessible, by those with resources,
            in major libraries at least in New York State. The most recent statistical
            data available at that time was for 1980, and in only three paragraphs
            of the thirty-three pages of text is the real property tax treated
            explicitly. An additional seventy pages have occasional references
            to it, with some rather interesting tables and graphics. All of these,
            however, are somewhat misleading. Were Messrs. Phares and Pomp consciously
            part of the confusion common in dealing with matters of property
            taxation or were they simply unaware of the sleight-of-hand that
            underlies most of the work in this area? My personal view is that
            they were simply not interested in probing more deeply into an area
            that was really beyond the Commission's scope. Still, the authors
            recognized that &#8220;Property taxes are the fiscal mainstay of
            local government. The incidence of the property tax is of substantial
            consequence in evaluating the State's overall tax structure.&#8221;6</p>
          <p>As for their treatment of the New York Local Property Tax, the authors
            first identified seven separate categories of real property: owner-occupied,
            rental, commercial, industrial, public utilities, farmland, and unimproved.
            This is a somewhat unusual classification, different even than those
            universally used in New York State.7 One can see immediately that
            there will necessarily be some overlap &#8211; &#8220;unimproved&#8221; parcels
            can sometimes be assigned in other categories according to their
            zoning. And rental property is commercial, whomever the tenants may
            be, whether households or businesses.</p>
          <p>To their credit, however, the authors devoted considerable attention
            to the issue of tax shifting, which is never an easy subject, including
            a discussion of taxes on real property. They recognized that no shifting
            occurs for vacant parcels and titleholders therefore bear the full
            burden. So also for homeowners. For rental properties they assigned
            50% of the burden to tenants, 25% to corporate stockowners, and 25%
            to real estate owners. For commercial, industrial, farmers, and public
            utility parcels, the shifting was put at 67%. In every instance where
            shifting is recognized, the part never shifted, of course, is the
            land component, and this is implicit in their assumption. These were
            referred to as &#8220;consensus incidence assumptions regarding the
            property tax.&#8221;8</p>
          <p>A third consideration they recognized is the potential for tax exporting
            to other states, more often important for classes other than residential
            property but still significant. It occurs both on account of titleholders
            being out-of-state and also because of what is known as the &#8220;federal
            offset,&#8221; i.e., the deductibility of state and local taxes for
            federal tax itemizing. For all New York State and local taxes taken
            together, they estimated that roughly 10% percent of total revenue
            is exported, but for real property taxes, the total exported is only
            about half that.</p>
          <p>Except in the implicit recognition involved in their analysis of
            shifting, the distinction between land and improvements was opaque.
            This is a remarkable oversight, because improvements typically depreciate
            at the rate of 0.5 to 1.5 percent annually; only land values appreciate.9
            And in view of the fact that assessments in New York localities have
            historically been very infrequent, one can understand how the land
            values are in reality a far higher proportion of parcel value than
            assessments would suggest.10 This means that in a period of seven
            years, for example, a property parcel could easily increase in price
            by 50 percent, far more if recent real estate market history is to
            be illustrative. Moreover real estate prices varied greatly in their
            rates of change during this time span; upstate New York was largely
            stable, but downstate localities experienced huge booms and busts.</p>
          <p>Recognition of this would tend to favor what is known as the &#8220;new
            view&#8221; of property tax incidence, an acceptance of the idea
            that &#8221;the burden of the tax on improvements remains with the
            owners of capital in the form of a lower net return instead of being
            shifted to users of property in the form of higher rents or prices.&#8221;11
            Proponents point out that &#8220;the tax on improvements is essentially
            a nationwide tax on capital . . . [and therefore] its incidence will
            depend on the characteristics of supply and demand for capital nationally
            rather than on a single market.&#8221;12 The effect of this is to
            make the tax &#8221;highly progressive.&#8221;13 Nonetheless, in
            a small footnote, Messrs. Pomp and Phares elected to go with the &#8220;old
            view&#8221; in stating that, &#8220;it seems most appropriate to
            assume that the new view does not apply to the analysis of tax burdens
            within one specific state (underlining in original). Thus, the old
            or traditional view was adhered to in the analysis. . ; that is,
            the excise effect of the tax was considered dominant.&#8221;14 The
            ubiquity of New York's property tax, and that it has over 1,300 local
            assessment and tax districts, may well have escaped their notice.</p>
          <p>This point is significant because the authors took great pains on
            several occasions to emphasize that the New York real property tax
            was the &#8220;most regressive element in the State's tax structure.&#8221;15
            In the Executive Summary, two of the thirteen bullets stressed that &#8221;the
            dominant influence in the tax system is the local real property tax,&#8221; and
            that &#8221;the local property tax is highly regressive, particularly
            the owner-occupied component.&#8221;16</p>
          <p>This was portrayed graphically, along with an accompanying table,
            using fourteen separate tax brackets showing effective tax rates
            ranging in a U, or a &#8220;reverse J curve,&#8221; from a high of
            20.51 percent of income for the lowest group, to 3.37 percent for
            the second to highest group.17 Nowhere in the Report is there an
            indication of what income measure was employed &#8211; Federal Adjusted
            Gross Income or Taxable Income, most likely. But it may also have
            been household income. If so, this could well have excluded significant
            income sources, particularly from those households receiving social
            security income and/or retirement income for New York State or local
            pensioners which is not taxable for state purposes. Whatever, this
            was recognized implicitly in the observation that &#8221;many persons
            are only temporarily in the lowest class ($0 - $4,199 for 1980) because
            of retirement, short-term unemployment, and so forth. If their income
            were measured over a longer period of time, rather than on the basis
            of only one year, they would not fall in the lowest class. Thus,
            the [drastically high effective tax rate] figure for this class .
            . . overstates the true burden on this group.&#8221;18</p>
