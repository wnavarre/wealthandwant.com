  <p>When we think of land, we think of soil and of sites. But in the larger
    sense, Land includes many other kinds of things. And many of these are
    very appropriate
    objects of taxation. Since no individual or corporation or government entity
    can create more of them, these scarce items get bid up. Why should that value
    be subject to privatization? Why should they be sold from one corporation
    to another, as broadcast frequencies and rush hour landing rights at congested
    airports currently are traded? A better way, a just way, would be for the
    holders of those scarce resources to pay the rest of us for the right to
    use them. After that rent is paid, the profits should be theirs to keep,
    their rightful gain (as long as they haven't harmed the environment or others
    in
    the process.</p>
  <p>Did you know that the royalties paid by oil companies today on oil extracted
    from under American soil were set in the 1870s? Do you think that the American
    commons is receiving the amount it should be receiving? How do you think
    that that shareholders of the oil companies are making out in this deal?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p>Any tax on capital has its downside effects, so that taxing savings causes
    people to save less, taxing consumption causes people to buy less, and taxing
    buildings causes people to build less. The result is that economists as well
    as businessmen usually frown upon taxing capital. Another alternative is
    to tax labor, but it is even more widely understood that taxing labor normally
    discourages people from working as much as they would in the absence of a
    tax. From this comes sentiment against taxing labor, even though for want
    of any alternative, people have today commonly come to accept it as a necessity.
    But electing to tax labor, just as for taxing capital, forecloses a discussion
    of the virtues of taxing land &#8212; not necessarily land as earth, but
    rather land as location. Yet land rent is the most attractive tax base of
    all, as rent is not earned; it is windfall income, entirely the result of
    being well situated in any market of scarce natural resources and where community
    demand (rather than one's own efforts) leads to an appreciation of that land's
    price. To be sure many people have learned to position themselves in situations
    where a land's market value is likely to rise &#8212; indeed these people
    come to think of themselves as astute investors. But the fact is that that
    market gain is not of their own doing at all; it is the result of common
    enterprise creating a surplus that comes to settle on land sites. An investment
    in land, in any form it might take, is speculation in greater or lesser degree.</p>
  <p>Land in all its forms is a tax base that also conforms well to all the classic
    principles of sound tax theory as enumerated above. <strong>Land is classically
    taken to mean not just surfaces of the earth but places in time, in space,
    in any
    medium whether it be solid, liquid or gas, and even as a form of light, in
    the electromagnetic spectrum, and in life forms.</strong> One needs to return
    to 19th century classical economic definitions of the factors of production
    to appreciate
    the separate significance of land as it was understood in its manifold forms.
    One should ask how it is that land, so important to 19th century classical
    economic theory, has been given so little attention today in neoclassical
    economics. This is a story only now recovered from the dusty archives of
    academic economic history. Once understood and appreciated, it may be one
    of the greatest, if very silent, political revolutions of world history.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

    all its powers, qualities, and products, except perhaps those portions of
    it which are for the time included in man's body or in his products, and
    which therefore temporarily belong to the categories, man and wealth, passing
    again in their reabsorption by nature into the category, land. &#8212; <em>The

THAT land is only a passive factor in production must be carefully kept in mind.
. . . Land cannot act, it can only be acted upon. . . . Nor is this principle
changed or avoided when we use the word land as expressive of the people who
own land. . . . <br>
  <br>
That the persons whom we call landowners may contribute their labor or their
capital to production is of course true, but that they should contribute to production
as landowners, and by virtue of that ownership, is as ridiculously impossible
as that the belief of a lunatic in his ownership of the moon should be the cause
of her brilliancy. &#8212;<em> The Science of Political Economy </em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe315.html">unabridged:

  <p> I AM writing these pages on the shore of Long Island, where the Bay of
    New York contracts to what is called the Narrows, nearly opposite the point
    where our legalized robbers, the Custom-House officers, board incoming steamers
    to ask strangers to take their first American swear, and where, if false
    oaths really colored the atmosphere the air would be bluer than is the sky
    on this gracious day. I turn from my writing-machine to the window, and drink
    in, with a pleasure that never seems to pall, the glorious panorama. <br>
      <br>
"What do you see?"&nbsp; If in ordinary talk I were asked this, I should of course
say, "I see land and water and sky, ships and houses, and light clouds, and the
sun drawing to its setting over the low green hills of Staten Island and illuminating
all." <br>
      <br>
  But if the question refer to the terms of political economy, I should say, "I
  see land and wealth." Land, which is the natural factor of production; and
  wealth, which is the natural factor so changed by the exertion of the human
  factor, labor, as to fit it for the satisfaction of human desires. For water
  and clouds, sky and sun, and the stars that will appear when the sun is sunk,
  are, in the terminology of political economy, as much land as is the dry surface
  of the earth to which we narrow the meaning of the word in ordinary talk. And
  the window through which I look; the flowers in the garden; the planted trees
  of the orchard; the cow that is browsing beneath them; the Shore Road under
  the window; the vessels that lie at anchor near the bank, and the little pier
  that juts out from it; the trans-Atlantic liner steaming through the channel;
  the crowded pleasure-steamers passing by; the puffing tug with its line of
  mud-scows; the fort and dwellings on the opposite side of the Narrows; the
  lighthouse that will soon begin to cast its far-gleaming eye from Sandy Hook;
  the big wooden elephant of Coney Island; and the graceful sweep of the Brooklyn
  Bridge, that may be discovered from a little higher up; all alike fall into
  the economic term wealth &#8212; land modified by labor so as to afford satisfaction
  to human desires. All in this panorama that was before man came here, and would
  remain were he to go, belongs to the economic category land; while all that
  has been produced by labor belongs to the economic category wealth, so long
  as it retains its quality of ministering to human desire. <br>
      <br>
  But on the hither shore, in view from the window, is a little rectangular piece
  of dry surface, evidently reclaimed from the line of water by filling in with
  rocks and earth. What is that? In ordinary speech it is land, as distinguished
  from water, and I should intelligibly indicate its origin by speaking of it
  as "made land." But in the categories of political economy there is no place
  for such a term as "made land." For the term land refers only and exclusively
  to productive powers derived wholly from nature and not at all from industry,
  and whatever is, and in so far as it is, derived from land by the exertion
  of&nbsp;&nbsp;labor, is wealth. This bit of dry surface raised above the level
  of the water by filling in stones and soil, is, in the economic category, not
  land but wealth. It has land below it and around it, and the material of which
  it is composed has been drawn from land; but in itself it is, in the proper
  speech of political economy, wealth; just as truly as the ships I behold are
  not land but wealth, though they too have land below them and around them and
  are composed of material drawn from land. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

  <li><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Capital </span>is the
      economic term that is most profoundly misunderstood and confused. For the
      term to make sense in any systematic analysis of wealth distribution, we
      must define capital in its classical sense as "wealth which is used to
      aid in further production, instead of being directly consumed." Since production
      is not completed until the product is in the hands of the consumer, products
      on their way to market, or "wealth in the course of exchange," are also
      considered capital.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now,
      the objective of all economic behavior is the satisfaction of human desires. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Human beings always seek to satisfy their
      desires with the least exertion</span>: this self-evident proposition lies
      at the heart of our concepts of economic value and exchange. </span>The
      primary thing needed for satisfaction is, of course, the tangible things,
      made from natural resources, that satisfy human desires and have exchange
      value. Things that meet these four fundamental criteria are termed "wealth".
      But money, bonds, and mortgages are but claims upon and measures of this
      value; they are not the wealth they symbolize.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>A clear understanding of these basic definitions points immediately
  to the primacy of land as an economic factor. Human beings have inescapable
  material needs of food, clothing and shelter. Regardless of how long a chain
  of exchanges they may pass through in a modern economy, these things ultimately
  have their source in the land; they can come from nowhere else. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Human
  beings need land in order to live. But if we must pay rent to a private land "owner" for
  access to the gifts of nature, it amounts to being charged a fee for our very
  right to live. </span><a

      as a Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> classical economists</span> treated land as distinct
        from capital: "land, labor and capital" were the three basic "factors
        of production."&nbsp; They were mutually exclusive.&nbsp; They were comprehensive,
        including all economic agents. Each was also "limitational," meaning
        at least some of each was needed for all economic activity (v.&nbsp; <a

        coherent system, like Humboldt&#8217;s Cosmos, in the spirit of The Enlightenment
        that spawned them both.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-style: italic;">Neo-classical</span> economists
      denied the distinction and undertook to purge land from economese.&nbsp; </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>Many of them, following John B. Clark and Frank Knight, still
          deny the distinction as I explain in <i><a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">The Corruption of Economics</a>, </i>a
          companion volume in this series.&nbsp; </small></li>
      <li><small>Many treat the matter by seizing on and stressing all similarities
          of land and capital, while ignoring all differences.&nbsp; </small></li>
      <li><small>Some invent gray areas that seem to fuse land and capital, present
          them as typical, and quickly move on.&nbsp; </small></li>
      <li><small>Many more simply ignore land, which has the effect of accepting
          the Clark-Knight verdict in practice.&nbsp; </small></li>
      <li><small>Others uneasily finesse and blur the issue by writing "land" in
          quotes, or trivializing its value, or referring vaguely to "quasi-rents" to
          comprehend a broad spectrum of incomes both from land and other factors.</small></li>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What ever possessed the neo-classicals
        to leave such a mess?&nbsp; One needs to know something of their times

        were obsessed with deflecting proposals, strongly supported at the time

      land markets, land policy, and land taxation work well for the general

      <small><b></b>Land is not produced, it was created.&nbsp; It is the world,
      the planet from which man evolved, with the sun that energizes it and the
      orbit that tempers it.&nbsp; Land is a free gift, variously expressed in
      different philosophies as Spaceship Earth, the Big Blue Marble, God's Gift,
      Creation, Gaia, The Promised Land, or nature.&nbsp; Mankind did not create
      The Earth with its space and resources, nor can we add to them.&nbsp; We
      can only acquire them, often by fighting, or rent-seeking, or in<b> </b>other
      counterproductive ways.&nbsp; Man at best improves and develops capacities
      inherent in the free gift.&nbsp; It is disappointing, and should alert
      us and make us suspicious, that economic analysis would ever purge out
      this paramount, self-evident truth.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>"Land" in economics means all natural resources and agents, with
      their sites (locations and extensions in space).&nbsp; Land is not just
      the matter occupying space: it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> space.
      It includes many things not colloquially called land, such as </small></div>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economic land <span
 style="font-style: italic;">excludes</span> many things, too, that are colloquially
        called land.&nbsp; It excludes land-fill, for example, by which many
        cities are extended into shallow waters.&nbsp; The site and seabed are
        properly land; the land-fill is an improvement.&nbsp; There is no "made
        land" in the economic sense: it is reallocated from other uses.&nbsp; Expanding
        cities take farmland from producing food and fiber, much of it for the
        expanding city itself.&nbsp; Filled land in shallow water near cities
        is taken away from anglers and sailors and viewers and ecologists, who
        now routinely&nbsp; organize to prevent it being "made" away with.&nbsp; Drained
        and filled wetlands are taken away from endangered species, as well as
        from their primal role as filters protecting coastal waters from river
        trash and pollutants.&nbsp; Thanks to the myopia and dereliction of economists,
        it has taken militant environmentalists to carry home this truth, developing
        in their struggle to be heard and understood a deep skepticism of economists
        and their "way of thinking." Some economists and environmentalists are
        now coming to terms with each other, after decades of mutual shunning.&nbsp; Too
        many modern economists, however, still use their "way of thinking" to
        seal out important new evidence that doesn't fit the model. </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Capital (K) is that which has been produced but not yet used up.&nbsp; Capital
      is formed by human thrift, forbearance, investment and production.&nbsp; Only
      after mankind forms and makes capital does it bear much likeness to land,
      in that they coexist.&nbsp; Ordinary micro-economics obscures the differences
      because it deals mainly with relations of coexistence, ignoring the continual
      formation and destruction of capital, ignoring time and relations of sequence.&nbsp; Thus
      it excludes from its purview one of the prime differences between land
      and capital.&nbsp; The life of capital, like that of people, is marked
      by major sacraments of birth, growth, aging and death - all missing from
      micro theory. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Economic life is a cavalcade
      in which the birth and death of capital are dated events.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Micro
      deals mainly with how existing resources are allocated at a moment in time,
      not how they originate, grow, flourish, reproduce, age, die, and decompose.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Capital occupies space; land <i>is </i>space.&nbsp; In common micro
      theory, resources and markets come together at a point not just in time
      but in space.&nbsp; Again, it excludes from its purview one of the prime
      qualities of land.<small><span

    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>6.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>It
          is ironic that economists purport or affect to ape the methods of physics,
          when they delete both space and time from their subject.&nbsp; If they
          have borrowed from physics, they have taken the form without the substance.
    </small></small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
        <small>For the reasons given, alone, land and capital are mutually exclusive. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">There
        are, however, nine more, which follow.</span> ... </small><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
      <small><b></b>Land as "site" (location plus extension) does not normally
      wear out, depreciate, spoil, obsolesce, nor get used up by human activities
      incident to occupancy and production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In contrast, capital depreciates from time and use,
      routinely and by nature.</span>&nbsp; After being formed, it must be conserved
      from entropy by continual maintenance, repair, remodeling, safeguarding
      against theft and fire, and so on.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">7</span></small>&nbsp; Like our
      own bodies, it returns to dust; <span style="font-weight: bold;">land is
      the dust to which it returns</span>.&nbsp; Inventories are depleted; moving
      parts wear out; fixed capital depreciates with use and time. ...</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>No one can get more land without others keeping less.&nbsp; One
      can acquire more capital by forming it through saving and investing.&nbsp; One
      can consume more by working more, while others work no less.&nbsp; Land
      is different: it is the most common basis of market power, therefore. &nbsp; ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>When demand grows for land in a specific area or neighborhood, land
      cannot immigrate to meet the higher demand.&nbsp; It is true that land
      elsewhere can be converted to the specific land <span
 style="font-style: italic;">use </span>that is demanded.&nbsp; Some micro theorists
      argue that this makes land as "mobile" as anything else, equating land
      and capital.&nbsp; It dovetails with and reinforces their paradigm centered
      on "the firm," a unit that can add unlimited inputs of all kinds in the
      long run, and among which competition drives all profits to zero.&nbsp; This
      rationalization overlooks the hoary adage of real estate: "value depends
      on three factors, location, location, and location." What happens then
      is<b> </b>not that supply rises to meet higher demand, but ground rent
      rises.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Land is not convertible into capital, nor <i>vice versa.&nbsp; </i>Exchange
      of land for capital has misled many into equating them, but only through
      inadvertence and the fallacy of composition.&nbsp; Exchange is not interchange:
      exchange does not change the quantity of either land or capital.&nbsp; Capital
      is convertible into any other form of capital each time it turns over,
      by using Capital Consumption Allowances, the proceedings of turnover, to
      hire people actually to produce new capital.&nbsp; Capital may also be
      disinvested and consumed, or augmented by new saving and investment.&nbsp; None
      of those is true of land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Land is indispensable to life, hence to economic activity.&nbsp; The
      same is generally true of labor and capital, but less "absolutely".&nbsp; Land
      can exist perfectly well without labor or capital, and support timber and
      wildlife, but labor and capital cannot exist at all without at least some
      land, and often a great deal of land.&nbsp; Substitution is limited.&nbsp; It
      will not do just to have 57 varieties of labor, or of capital.&nbsp; There
      must be at least some land.&nbsp; Remember, land includes space itself,
      and a time-slot in it.&nbsp; It includes air and water, the environment
      and the ecology and all original matter itself.&nbsp; Without land there
      is nothing.<small><span

    without a campsite.&nbsp; Perhaps this is why modern economists have so little
    to say about homelessness.&nbsp; Joblessness they have dismissed as part
    of the vital economic function of "job-seeking," with which they have persuaded
    at least themselves.&nbsp; The next logical step is that the person sleeping
    in the doorway is not really homeless, but just engaged in the vital market
    function of "home-seeking".&nbsp; Rather than seem totally absurd they are
    simply silent, except to stress the "exclusionary principle" of private property

  <small>Land is traditionally subject to a host of legal and customary limits

  about land to be owned.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are easements through, air rights
  over, mineral rights under, and neighbors and zoning all around any parcel
  of land.&nbsp; Changing lot lines is unavoidably a social process, there is
  no other way.</small><br>

  <small>A large share of the more valuable land in cities is held by estates.&nbsp; Public
  and eleemosynary [non-profit] holders are preferentially tax exempt and often
  without any visible motive to economize.&nbsp; Water licenses are held subject
  to "use it or lose it" traditions leading to appalling waste.&nbsp; Broadcasting/telecasting
  licenses are highly political.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; Only a resource with
  the characteristics of land could be subject to such a wide range of non-economic
  pressures.&nbsp;&nbsp; ....</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Amassing land is always done, can only be done, by shrinking the holdings
  of others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt.&nbsp; If A is to have more then B,
  C, D <i>et al. </i>must have less, there is no other way.&nbsp; A can amass
  more capital by saving, creating new capital, leaving B, C, D <i>et al. </i>with
  as much as before.&nbsp; A can increase his labor income by working longer,
  or harder, or smarter, producing more, leaving others with as much as before.&nbsp; He
  and she together can also spawn more children: labor, like capital, is reproducible,
  and indefinitely augmentable.&nbsp; Possessing land, however, means just one
  thing: bumping others.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>In the region of the mind, the thing possessed may be shared by all
  with no diminution to anyone.&nbsp; No one's pleasure In Shakespeare, or Beethoven,
  or understanding physics is any less because at the same time millions of others
  have the same pleasure.&nbsp; Art, letters and science are the common property
  of mankind, open to all who care to acquire them.&nbsp; The creative producer's
  pleasure is in proportion to the number with whom he shares.&nbsp; The gratification
  is from sharing, not excluding.&nbsp; The contrast with landholding is nearly

    <small>Amassing claims on wealth by creating and producing is not, therefore,

    market, but glutting one market increases real demand for the products of
    other markets, and raises the real value of others' incomes by lowering prices.&nbsp; Amassing
    land, however, has to deprive others, both relatively and absolutely.&nbsp; Concentrated
    holding and control of land, therefore, have always been threats to the well-being
    of those left out.</small><br>

  <small>Conversely, the only way the landless, e.g. in South Africa, can get

  because land does not grow.&nbsp; When production and demand grow, land rents
  rise.&nbsp; Of land it is starkly true, "the problem is not production, but

      Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Land,&#8221; in the language of economics, includes all natural resources:
      the three-dimensional space on the surface of the Earth (including space
    in and on water); material land such as minerals, water, and oil; the electromagnetic
      spectrum; wildlife (including wild animals and forests); and satellite
    orbits.</p>
  <p>The most important potential source of public revenue from land is real
    estate sites. The income from land has been called &#8220;ground rent,&#8221; &#8220;economic
      rent,&#8221; or just &#8220;rent.&#8221; The term &#8220;rent&#8221; here
      will refer to the income only from the land, excluding what is paid for
      the use
      of the improvements. The &#8220;economic rent&#8221; with respect to land
      refers to the maximum that a tenant would bid for the use of the site.
      I have called
      this &#8220;geo-rent&#8221; to differentiate it from &#8220;rent&#8221; as
      a payment for any resource or from the actual amount a tenant may pay,
      which could be less than what the market could bear. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Impact on production</strong></p>
  <p>It is widely understood that when something is taxed, we get less of it.
    As discussed above, this reduction in labor, production, and investment is
    called the &#8220;excess burden&#8221; or &#8220;deadweight loss&#8221; of
    taxation. Income taxation discourages work, sales and value-added taxes discourage
    consumption, capital gains taxes discourage investment, and real property
    taxes discourage building and improving property. Those taxes make the asset
    or activity more costly, which then reduces the quantity bought of the thing
    being taxed.</p>
  <p>What makes land different is that its supply is fixed, and it is independent
    of human action. When land value or rent is tapped for public revenue, the
    land does not shrink, flee, or hide.</p>
  <p>Recall the definition above, that land means natural resources. Real estate
    sites consist of the three dimensional space within some boundary of title
    or jurisdiction. We cannot import land to expand the amount of space. There
    can be no land factories to produce more space. Chopping down trees, leveling
    inclined slopes, and draining and filling in water only change the material
    contents of the space, not the extent or location of the space. Building
    taller just makes more space usable; the three-dimensional space does not
    expand. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

                <small>The characteristics of land are well known. </small></div>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <li><small>Land has a fixed supply. The space within some boundary
                  can be neither expanded nor contracted. </small></li>
              <li><small>Land is fixed not only in extent but also in mobility,
                  unlike people, who can migrate, or capital goods, which are
                  more or less mobile. </small></li>
              <li><small>Land cannot be imported. Even in the case of buildings
                  and other permanent structures, they differ from land in that
                  they are created by human enterprise, and in that their creators
                  decide where the structure will be located. </small></li>
              <li><small>Finally, land is not something to be discovered. Once
                  people figured out that the earth was a sphere, and its approximate

                  it is not vital in discovering that the land is out there.

                on Parts of the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who
      Pays New York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>                The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
                what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered
                this more than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps,
                than anyone has since. He recognized full well that the economic
                surplus not expended by human hands or minds in the production
                of capital wealth gravitates to land. Particular land sites come
                to reflect the value of their strategic location for market exchanges
                by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless whether
                those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
                of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate
                with their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than
                a century ago observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in
                their sleep without working, risking or economizing. The increase
                in the value of land, arising as it does from the efforts of
                an entire community, should belong to the community and not to
                the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery
                by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
                situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental
                value is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching
                a market price and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls
                for the recovery in taxes what is the community&#8217;s creation.
                Moreover, the failure to recover the land rent connected to sites
                makes it necessary to tax productive activities in our economy,
                and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known as &#8220;deadweight
              loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
              <p><strong>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor
                  of production not created by human hands or minds, is ours
                  only to use, not
                to buy or sell as a commodity.</strong> In the equally immortal words
                of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The earth belongs in usufruct
                to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common stock for men
                to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a bit
                of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood
                since Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the
                right to use the property of another so long as its value is
                not diminished.&#8221;36 Note also that Jefferson regarded the
                earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not allotted to individuals
                with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to the living&#8221; might
                be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
                who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we
                do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from
                our children.&#8221; The presumption that real property titles
                are acquired legitimately is a claim that does not withstand
                scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin ultimately
                to force or fraud.37</p>
              <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and
                the rent that derives from those sites is due to community enterprise,
                it is not a large logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s
                recovery of that rent should be the proper source of taxation.
                This is the Georgist argument: that the recapture of land rent
                is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source of taxation.38 </p>

                The right to use the frequency spectrum is a scarce resource, whose
                value is derived primarily from the mere existence of the spectrum
                and not from the efforts of those who might be granted use. Thus
                the whole population has equal respectable claims to use. But efficient
                use of the resource requires exclusive assignment of frequencies
                within particular geographical areas. Therefore justice is served
                by requiring those who receive the privilege of use to compensate
              the rest of the population for that privilege. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Spectrum.html">read the whole article</a></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Every community, whatever its political name and extent &#8212; village,
                city, state or province or nation &#8212; has its own normal,
                unfailing income, growing with the growth of the community and
                always adequate
              to meet necessary governmental expenditure.</p>
              <p>To explain: <strong>Every community has an indefeasible original right
                to the land on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified
                properties and advantages of that particular area of the earth's
                surface. To this land in its natural state, undrained, unfenced,
                unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including its waters, its
                contents and its location, every individual in the community (which
                may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right,
                while all the individuals together have a joint right to the value
                for use which society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</strong></p>
              <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the
                not particularly descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic
              Rent.&quot;</p>
              <p> Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece
                  of ground is the largest annual amount voluntarily offered
                for the
                    exclusive use of that ground, or of an equivalent parcel,
                independent of improvements thereon. Every holder or user of
                land pays economic
                    rent, but he now pays most of it to the wrong party. The
                aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
                unit
      is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than
                    sufficient, for the legitimate expenses of the government
                of that unit. As also stated above, the economic rent belongs
                to the community,
                  and not to individual landowners. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read
