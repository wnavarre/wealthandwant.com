  <p>Not only do Georgist reforms allow us
  to keep more of our wages, they also create jobs and increase
  wages.&nbsp; What the employer doesn't have to pay to the landlord
  (because taxes on land are not passed along) and in other taxes, is
  available to pay to employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Georgists share the goal of increasing wages, but would not advocate minimum
    wage or living wage legislation as the way to achieve higher wages.</p>
  <p>When wages rise, who benefits? The answer turns out to be that the key beneficiary
    is the landholder. The fellow with a well-located property to rent can ask
    more for it, and the one with a well-located property to sell can ask more
    for that. He didn't create the wage increase, or work harder himself; he
    may not even live locally. Nonetheless, he is the beneficiary. (Winston Churchill
    spoke to this issue quite eloquently.)</p>
  <p>But this can be disarmed by placing our taxes on land values.</p>
  <p>Think how different things might be had this reform taken place before women
    entered the job market in large numbers. Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren
    Tyagi wrote <em>The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle Class Mothers and Fathers
    Are Going Broke, </em>which documents the extent to which today's young families
    have high fixed costs compared to their parents' generation. (They don't
    &quot;<a href="The_Cat.html">see
    the cat</a>&quot; but they certainly document some important parts of the landscape.)
    Had we as a society shifted toward land value taxation, instead of landholders
    reaping the benefit of increasing work hours and wages, there would be far
    more prosperity among both working couples
    and
    families
    where
    a single
    income
    is supporting
    a family.</p>
  <p>But there is also another layer of relationship between wages and economic
    rent: economic rent tends to consume an increasingly large <em>share</em> of
    productivity. The landlord comes out the winner, and the entrepreneur is
    the risk-taker. Wages don't rise as fast as rents do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Whether we formulate it as an extension of the margin of production, or as
          a carrying of the rent line beyond the margin of production, the influence
          of speculation in land in increasing rent is a great fact which cannot be ignored
          in any complete theory of the distribution of wealth in progressive countries.
          It is the force, evolved by material progress, which tends constantly to increase
          rent in a greater ratio than progress increases production, and thus constantly
          tends, as material progress goes on and productive power increases, to reduce
          wages, not merely relatively, but absolutely.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">The cause which limits speculation in commodities, the tendency of increasing
        price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot limit the speculative advance
        in land values, as land is a fixed quantity, which human agency can neither
        increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless a limit to the price of land,
        in the minimum required by labor and capital as the condition of engaging in
        production. If it were possible continuously to reduce wages until zero were
        reached, it would be possible continuously to increase rent until it swallowed
        up the whole produce. But as wages cannot be permanently reduced below the
        point at which laborers will consent to work and reproduce, nor interest below
        the point at which capital will be devoted to production, there is a limit
        which restrains the speculative advance of rent. Hence speculation cannot have
        the same scope to advance rent in countries where wages and interest are already
        near the minimum, as in countries where they are considerably above it. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/04_Land_spec_wages.htm">read the whole chapter</a></div>

      <p>Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down while
        productive power grows, because land, which is the source of all wealth
        and the field of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate poverty, to
        make wages what justice commands they should be, the full earnings of
        the laborer, we must therefore substitute for the individual ownership
        of land a common ownership.*</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">*By the phrase &quot;common ownership&quot; of land,
            Henry George did not mean that land should be held in common or by
            the State, nor did he propose to interfere with the existing system
            of land tenures. (See Sections 7 and 12, post.) As in this condensation
            much of George's argument necessarily has been omitted, the following
            extracts from his later work &quot;Protection or Free Trade,&quot; chapter
            XXVI, are appended to make his position clear to the present reader.</font></p>

            long as any one else could come in and turn him out of the land in
            which or on which such improvement must be fixed. Thus is it absolutely
            necessary to the proper use and improvement of land that society
            should secure to the user and improver safe possession. ... We can
            leave land now being used in the secure possession of those using
            it. ... on condition that those who hold land shall pay to the community
            a ... rent based on the value of the privilege the individual receives
            from the community in being accorded the exclusive use of this much
            of the common property, and which should have no reference to any
            improvement he has made in or on it, or to any profit due to the
            use of his labor and capital. In this way all would be placed on

                            than balance the higher tax on it, (and this overlooks, for one
                            thing, the discouragement to speculation in land), the reduction
                            or removal of other taxes is all clear gain. It is easier to
                            save in proportion as earnings and commodities are relieved of
                            taxation. It is easier to buy land, because its selling price
                            is lower, if the land is taxed. And although the land, after
                            its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can this tax be
                            fully paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the purchase
                            price, but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on
                            buildings and other improvements and in whatever other taxes
                            are thus rendered unnecessary. H.G.B.</font></p>

      <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon
        the labor market. Competition would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead
        of laborers competing with
                each other for employment, and in their competition cutting down
        wages to the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be
        competing for laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings of
        labor.
        For
                into the labor market would have entered the greatest of all
        competitors for the employment of labor, a competitor whose demand cannot
        be
        satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the demand of labor itself.
        The employers of labor would not have merely to bid against other employers,
        all feeling
                the stimulus of greater trade and increased profits, but against
        the ability of laborers to become their own employers upon the natural
        opportunities

        <div style="text-align: left;">When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land,
                    all landholders are likely to take the alarm, and there will not
                    be wanting appeals to the fears of small farm and homestead owners,
                    who will be told that this is a proposition to rob them of their
                    hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will show that this
                    proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as landholders
                    do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists,
                    or both. And further consideration will show that though the large
                    landholders may lose relatively, yet even in their case there will
                    be an absolute gain. For, the increase in production will be so great
                    that labor and capital will gain very much more than will be lost
                    to private landownership, while in these gains, and in the greater
                    ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the whole community,
                  including the landowners themselves, will share.</div>

                      benefit all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head

                      producers and exchangers of all sorts from the peddler or drayman

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Take, now, the case of the homestead owner -- the mechanic,
                storekeeper, or professional man who has secured himself a house
                and lot, where he lives, and
      which he contemplates with satisfaction as a place from which his family cannot
      be ejected in case of his death. He will not be injured; on the contrary, he
      will be the gainer. The selling value of his lot will diminish -- theoretically
      it will entirely disappear. But its usefulness to him will not disappear. It
      will serve his purpose as well as ever. While, as the value of all other lots
      will diminish or disappear in the same ratio, he retains the same security
      of always having a lot that he had before. That is to say, he is a loser only
      as the man who has bought himself a pair of boots may be said to be a loser
      by a subsequent fall in the price of boots. His boots will be just as useful
      to him, and the next pair of boots he can get cheaper. So, to the homestead
      owner, his lot will be as useful, and should he look forward to getting a larger
      lot, or having his children, as they grow up, get homesteads of their own,
      he will, even in the matter of lots, be the gainer. And in the present, other
      things considered, he will be much the gainer. For though he will have more
      taxes to pay upon his land, he will be released from taxes upon his house and
      improvements, upon his furniture and personal property, upon all that he and
      his family eat, drink and wear, while his earnings will be largely increased
      by the rise of wages, the constant employment, and the increased briskness
      of trade. His only loss will be, if he wants to sell his lot without getting
      another, and this will be a small loss compared with the great gain.... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read

              inquiry is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the
              growth and decay of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated
              recognitions of relation and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions.

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils
              arising from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are
              becoming more and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not
              incidents of progress, but tendencies which must bring progress to a
              halt; that they will not cure themselves, but, on the contrary, must,
              unless their cause is removed, grow greater and greater, until they sweep
              us back into barbarism by the road every previous civilization has trod.
              But it also shows that these evils are not imposed by natural laws; that
              they spring solely from social maladjustments which ignore natural laws,
              and that in removing their cause we shall be giving an enormous impetus

          Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>          Since man can live only on land and from land, since land is the reservoir
            of matter and force from which man&#8217;s body itself is taken,
            and on which he must draw for all that he can produce, does it not
            irresistibly follow that to give the land in ownership to some men
            and to deny to others all right to it is to divide mankind into the
            rich and the poor, the privileged and the helpless? Does it not follow
            that those who have no rights to the use of land can live only by
            selling their power to labor to those who own the land? Does it not
            follow that what the socialists call &#8220;the iron law of wages,&#8221; what
            the political economists term &#8220;the tendency of wages to a minimum,&#8221; must
            take from the landless masses &#8212; the mere laborers, who of themselves
            have no power to use their labor &#8212; all the benefits of any
            possible advance or improvement that does not alter this unjust division
            of land? For having no power to employ themselves, they must, either
            as labor-sellers or as land-renters, compete with one another for
            permission to labor. This competition with one another of men shut
            out from God&#8217;s inexhaustible storehouse has no limit but starvation,
            and must ultimately force wages to their lowest point, the point
            at which life can just be maintained and reproduction carried on.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that all wages must fall to this point, but that
          the wages of that necessarily largest stratum of laborers who have
          only ordinary knowledge, skill and aptitude must so fall. The wages
          of special classes, who are fenced off from the pressure of competition
          by peculiar knowledge, skill or other causes, may remain above that
          ordinary level. Thus, where the ability to read and write is rare its
          possession enables a man to obtain higher wages than the ordinary laborer.
          But as the diffusion of education makes the ability to read and write
          general this advantage is lost. So when a vocation requires special
          training or skill, or is made difficult of access by artificial restrictions,
          the checking of competition tends to keep wages in it at a higher level.
          But as the progress of invention dispenses with peculiar skill, or
          artificial restrictions are broken down, these higher wages sink to
          the ordinary level. And so, it is only so long as they are special
          that such qualities as industry, prudence and thrift can enable the
          ordinary laborer to maintain a condition above that which gives a mere
          living. Where they become general, the law of competition must reduce
          the earnings or savings of such qualities to the general level &#8212; which,
          land being monopolized and labor helpless, can be only that at which
          the next lowest point is the cessation of life. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
        <p>I have already referred generally to the defects that attach to all
          socialistic remedies for the evil condition of labor, but respect for
          your Holiness dictates that I should speak specifically, even though
          briefly, of the remedies proposed or suggested by you.</p>
        <p>Of these, the widest and strongest are that the state should restrict
          the hours of labor, the employment of women and children, the unsanitary
          conditions of workshops, etc. Yet how little may in this way be accomplished.</p>
        <p>A strong, absolute ruler might hope by such regulations to alleviate
          the conditions of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our times is
          toward democracy, and democratic states are necessarily weaker in paternalism,
          while in the industrial slavery, growing out of private ownership of
          land, that prevails in Christendom today, it is not the master who
          forces the slave to labor, but the slave who urges the master to let
          him labor. Thus the greatest difficulty in enforcing such regulations
          comes from those whom they are intended to benefit. It is not, for
          instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce restrictions
          on child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, prompted by poverty,
          misrepresent the ages of their children even to the masters, and teach
          the children to misrepresent.</p>
        <p>But while in large factories and mines regulations as to hours, ages,
          etc., though subject to evasion and offering opportunities for extortion
          and corruption, may be to some extent enforced, how can they have any
          effect in those far wider branches of industry where the laborer works
          for himself or for small employers?</p>
        <p>All such remedies are of the nature of the remedy for overcrowding
          that is generally prescribed with them &#8212; the restriction under
          penalty of the number who may occupy a room and the demolition of unsanitary
          buildings. Since these measures have no tendency to increase house
          accommodation or to augment ability to pay for it, the overcrowding
          that is forced back in some places goes on in other places and to a
          worse degree. All such remedies begin at the wrong end. They are like
          putting on brake and bit to hold in quietness horses that are being
          lashed into frenzy; they are like trying to stop a locomotive by holding
          its wheels instead of shutting off steam; like attempting to cure smallpox
          by driving back its pustules. Men do not overwork themselves because
          they like it; it is not in the nature of the mother&#8217;s heart to
          send children to work when they ought to be at play; it is not of choice
          that laborers will work under dangerous and unsanitary conditions.
          These things, like overcrowding, come from the sting of poverty. And
          so long as the poverty of which they are the expression is left untouched,
          restrictions such as you indorse can have only partial and evanescent
          results. The cause remaining, repression in one place can only bring
          out its effects in other places, and the task you assign to the state
          is as hopeless as to ask it to lower the level of the ocean by bailing
          out the sea.</p>
        <p><strong>Nor can the state cure poverty by regulating wages. It is as much
          beyond the power of the state to regulate wages as it is to regulate
          the rates of interest. Usury laws have been tried again and again,
          but the only effect they have ever had has been to increase what the
          poorer borrowers must pay, and for the same reasons that all attempts
          to lower by regulation the price of goods have always resulted merely
          in increasing them. The general rate of wages is fixed by the ease
          or difficulty with which labor can obtain access to land, ranging from
          the full earnings of labor, where land is free, to the least on which
          laborers can live and reproduce, where land is fully monopolized. Thus,
          where it has been comparatively easy for laborers to get land, as in
          the United States and in Australasia, wages have been higher than in
          Europe and it has been impossible to get European laborers to work
          there for wages that they would gladly accept at home; while as monopolization
          goes on under the influence of private property in land, wages tend
          to fall, and the social conditions of Europe to appear. Thus, under
          the partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to land, of
          which I have spoken, the many attempts of the British Parliament to
          reduce wages by regulation failed utterly. And so, when the institution
          of private property in land had done its work in England, all attempts
          of Parliament to raise wages proved unavailing. In the beginning of
          this century it was even attempted to increase the earnings of laborers
          by grants in aid of wages. But the only result was to lower commensurately
          what wages employers paid.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The state could maintain wages above the tendency of the market
            (for as I have shown labor deprived of land becomes a commodity),
            only by
          offering employment to all who wish it; or by lending its sanction
          to strikes and supporting them with its funds. Thus it is, that the
          thoroughgoing socialists who want the state to take all industry into
          its hands are much more logical than those timid socialists who propose
          that the state should regulate private industry &#8212; but only a
          little.</strong></p>
        <p>The same hopelessness attends your suggestion that working-people
          should be encouraged by the state in obtaining a share of the land.
          It is evident that by this you mean that, as is now being attempted
          in Ireland, the state shall buy out large landowners in favor of small
          ones, establishing what are known as peasant proprietors. Supposing
          that this can be done even to a considerable extent, what will be accomplished
          save to substitute a larger privileged class for a smaller privileged
          class? What will be done for the still larger class that must remain,
          the laborers of the agricultural districts, the workmen of the towns,
          the proletarians of the cities? Is it not true, as Professor De Laveleye
          says, that in such countries as Belgium, where peasant proprietary
          exists, the tenants, for there still exist tenants, are rack-rented
          with a mercilessness unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that in such
          countries as Belgium the condition of the mere laborer is even worse
          than it is in Great Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if
          the state attempts to buy up land for peasant proprietors will not
          the effect be, what is seen today in Ireland, to increase the market
          value of land and thus make it more difficult for those not so favored,
          and for those who will come after, to get land? How, moreover, on the
          principle which you declare (36), that &#8220;to the state the interests
          of all are equal, whether high or low,&#8221; will you justify state
          aid to one man to buy a bit of land without also insisting on state
          aid to another man to buy a donkey, to another to buy a shop, to another
          to buy the tools and materials of a trade &#8212; state aid in short
          to everybody who may be able to make good use of it or thinks that
          he could? And are you not thus landed in communism &#8212; not the
          communism of the early Christians and of the religious orders, but
          communism that uses the coercive power of the state to take rightful
          property by force from those who have, to give to those who have not?
          For the state has no purse of Fortunatus; the state cannot repeat the
          miracle of the loaves and fishes; all that the state can give, it must
          get by some form or other of the taxing power. And whether it gives
          or lends money, or gives or lends credit, it cannot give to those who
          have not, without taking from those who have.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
        <p>You assume that the labor question is a question between wage-workers
          and their employers. <strong>But working for wages is not the primary
          or exclusive occupation of labor. Primarily men work for themselves
          without the
          intervention of an employer. And the primary source of wages is in
          the earnings of labor, the man who works for himself and consumes his
          own products receiving his wages in the fruits of his labor. Are not
          fishermen, boatmen, cab-drivers, peddlers, working farmers &#8212; all,
          in short, of the many workers who get their wages directly by the sale
          of their services or products without the medium of an employer, as
          much laborers as those who work for the specific wages of an employer?</strong>          In your consideration of remedies you do not seem even to have thought
          of them. Yet in reality the laborers who work for themselves are the
          first to be considered, since what men will be willing to accept from
          employers depends manifestly on what they can get by working for themselves.</p>
        <p>You assume that all employers are rich men, who might raise wages
          much higher were they not so grasping. But is it not the fact that
          the great majority of employers are in reality as much pressed by competition
          as their workmen, many of them constantly on the verge of failure?
          Such employers could not possibly raise the wages they pay, however
          they might wish to, unless all others were compelled to do so. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
        <p>See how fully and how beautifully Christ&#8217;s life on earth illustrated
          this law. Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as
          it is appointed that all should enter it, he lovingly took what in
          the natural order is lovingly rendered, the sustenance, secured by
          labor, that one generation owes to its immediate successors. Arrived
          at maturity, he earned his own subsistence by that common labor in
          which the majority of men must and do earn it. Then passing to a higher &#8212; to
          the very highest &#8212; sphere of labor, he earned his subsistence
          by the teaching of moral and spiritual truths, receiving its material
          wages in the love-offerings of grateful hearers, and not refusing the
          costly spikenard with which Mary anointed his feet. So, when
          he chose his disciples, he did not go to landowners or other monopolists
          who
          live on the labor of others, but to common laboring-men.<strong> And
          when he called them to a higher sphere of labor and sent them out to
          teach
          moral and spiritual truths, he told them to take, without condescension
          on the one hand or sense of degradation on the other, the loving return
            for such labor, saying to them that &#8220;the laborer is worthy of
            his hire,&#8221; thus showing, what we hold, that all labor does
            not consist in what is called manual labor, but that whoever helps
            to add
            to the material, intellectual, moral or spiritual fullness of life

        <p>In assuming that laborers, even ordinary manual laborers, are naturally
          poor, you ignore the fact that labor is the producer of wealth, and
          attribute to the natural law of the Creator an injustice that comes
          from man&#8217;s impious violation of his benevolent intention. In
          the rudest stage of the arts it is possible, where justice prevails,
          for all well men to earn a living. With the labor-saving appliances
          of our time, it should be possible for all to earn much more. And so,
          in saying that poverty is no disgrace, you convey an unreasonable implication.
          For poverty ought to be a disgrace, since in a condition of social
          justice, it would, where unsought from religious motives or unimposed
          by unavoidable misfortune, imply recklessness or laziness. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>

          relations of life, under normal conditions, of principles that in ethics
          are only to be tolerated under extraordinary conditions. You are driven
          to this assertion of false rights by your denial of true rights. The
          natural right which each man has is not that of demanding employment
          or wages from another man; but that of employing himself &#8212; that
          of applying by his own labor to the inexhaustible storehouse which
          the Creator has in the land provided for all men. <strong>Were that storehouse
          open, as by the single tax we would open it, the natural demand for
          labor would keep pace with the supply, the man who sold labor and the
          man who bought it would become free exchangers for mutual advantage,
          and all cause for dispute between workman and employer would be gone.
          For then, all being free to employ themselves, the mere opportunity
          to labor would cease to seem a boon; and since no one would work for
          another for less, all things considered, than he could earn by working
          for himself, wages would necessarily rise to their full value, and
          the relations of workman and employer be regulated by mutual interest
          and convenience.</strong></p>
        <p>This is the only way in which they can be satisfactorily regulated.</p>
        <p>Your Holiness seems to assume that there is some just rate of wages
          that employers ought to be willing to pay and that laborers should
          be content to receive, and to imagine that if this were secured there
          would be an end of strife. This rate you evidently think of as that
          which will give working-men a frugal living, and perhaps enable them

          in the one case as in the other check that interplay that most effectively
          promotes the economical adjustment of productive forces? Why should
          buyers of labor, any more than buyers of commodities, be called on
          to pay higher prices than in a free market they are compelled to pay?
          Why should the sellers of labor be content with anything less than
          in a free market they can obtain? Why should working-men be content
          with frugal fare when the world is so rich? Why should they be satisfied
          with a lifetime of toil and stinting, when the world is so beautiful?
          Why should not they also desire to gratify the higher instincts, the

be demonstrated to be a fundamental error &#8212; the fruitful parent of a long
series of errors, which vitiate most important practical conclusions. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html"> &#8212; Book

          <br>
THE fundamental truth, that in all economic reasoning must be firmly grasped
and never let go, is that society in its most highly developed form is but an
elaboration of society in its rudest beginnings, and that principles obvious
in the simpler relations of men are merely disguised and not abrogated or reversed
by the more intricate relations that result from the division of labor and the
use of complex tools and methods. . . . And so, if we reduce to their lowest
terms all the complex operations of modern production, we see that each individual
who takes part in this infinitely subdivided and intricate network of production
and exchange is really doing what the primeval man did when he climbed the trees
for fruit or followed the receding tide for shellfish &#8212; endeavoring to
obtain from nature by the exertion of his powers the satisfaction of his desires.
If we keep this firmly in mind, if we look upon production as a whole &#8212; as
the co-operation of all embraced in any of its great groups to satisfy the various
desires of each, we plainly see that the reward each obtains for his exertions
comes as truly and as directly from nature as the result of that exertion, as
did that of the first man. <br>
          <br>
To illustrate: In the simplest state of which we can conceive, each man digs
his own bait and catches his own fish. The advantage of the division of labor
soon becomes apparent, and one digs bait while the others fish. Yet evidently
the one who digs bait is in reality doing as much toward the catching of fish
as any of those who actually take the fish. So when the advantages of canoes
are discovered, and instead of all going a-fishing, one stays behind and makes
and repairs canoes, the canoe-maker is in reality devoting his labor to the taking
of fish as much as the actual fishermen, and the fish which he eats at night
when the fishermen come home, are as truly the product of his labor as of theirs.
And thus when the division of labor is fairly inaugurated, and instead of each
attempting to satisfy all of his wants by direct resort to nature, one fishes,
another hunts, a third picks berries, a fourth gathers fruit, a fifth makes tools,
a sixth builds huts, and a seventh prepares clothing &#8212; each one is, to
the extent he exchanges the direct product of his own labor for the direct product
of the labor of others, really applying his own labor to the production of the
things he uses &#8212; is in effect satisfying his particular desires by the
exertion of his particular powers; that is to say, what he receives he in reality
produces. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp011.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp011.html"> &#8212; Book

LABOR always precedes wages. This is as universally true of wages received by
the laborer from an employer as it is of wages taken directly by the laborer
who is his own employee. In the one class of cases as in the other, reward is
conditioned upon exertion. Paid sometimes by the day, oftener by the week or
month, occasionally by the year, and in many branches of production by the piece,
the payment of wages by an employer to an employee always implies the previous
rendering of labor by the employee for the benefit of the employer, for the few
cases in which advance payments are made for personal services are evidently
referable either to charity or to guarantee and purchase. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html"> &#8212; Book

&nbsp; <br>
THE payment of wages always implies the previous rendering of labor. Now, what
does the rendering of labor in production imply? Evidently the production of
wealth, which, if it is to be exchanged or used in production, is capital. Therefore,
the payment of capital in wages pre-supposes a production of capital by the labor
for which the wages are paid. And as the employer generally makes a profit, the
payment of wages is, so far as he is concerned, but the return to the laborer
of a portion of the capital he has received from the labor. So far as the employee
is concerned, it is but the receipt of a portion of the capital his labor has
previously produced. As the value paid in the wages is thus exchanged for a value
brought into being by the labor, how can it be said that wages are drawn from
capital or advanced by capital? As in the exchange of labor for wages the employer
always gets the capital created by the labor before he pays out capital in the
wages, at what point is his capital lessened even temporarily? &#8212;<em> <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html"> &#8212; Book

To recapitulate: The man who works for himself gets his wages in the things he
produces, as he produces them, and exchanges this value into another form whenever
he sells the produce. The man who works for another for stipulated wages in money,
works under a contract of exchange. He also creates his wages as he renders his
labor, but he does not get them except at stated times, in stated amounts and
in a different form. In performing the labor he is advancing in exchange; when
he gets his wages the exchange is completed. During the time he is earning the
wages he is advancing capital to his employer, but at no time, unless wages are
paid before work is done, is the employer advancing capital to him. Whether the
employer who receives this produce in exchange for the wages, immediately re-exchanges
it, or keeps it for awhile, no more alters the character of the transaction than
does the final disposition of the product made by the ultimate receiver, who
may, perhaps, be in another quarter of the globe and at the end of a series of
exchanges numbering hundreds. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html"> &#8212; Book

        <p>THE fundamental principle of human action &#8212; the law that is
          to political economy what the law of gravitation is to physics &#8212; is
          that men seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion. . .
          . Now, under this principle, what, in conditions of freedom, will be
          the terms at which one man can hire others to work for him? Evidently,
          they will be fixed by what the men could make if laboring for themselves.
          The principle which will prevent him from having to give anything above
          this except what is necessary to induce the change, will also prevent
          them from taking less. Did they demand more, the competition of others
          would prevent them from getting employment. Did he offer less, none
          would accept the terms, as they could obtain greater results by working
          for themselves. Thus, although the employer wishes to pay as little
          as possible, and the employee to receive as much as possible, wages
          will be fixed by the value or produce of such labor to the laborers
          themselves. If wages are temporarily carried either above or below
          this line, a tendency to carry them back at once arises. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html"> Book

          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> THE effect of all the circumstances
          which give rise to the differences between wages in different occupations
          may be included as supply and demand, and it is perfectly correct to
          say that the wages in different occupations will vary relatively according
          to differences in the supply and demand of labor &#8212; meaning by
          demand the call which the community as a whole makes for services of
          the particular kind, and by supply the relative amount of labor which,
          under the existing conditions, can be determined to the performance
          of those particular services. But though this is true as to the relative
          differences of wages, when it is said, as is commonly said, that the
          general rate of wages is determined by supply and demand, the words
          are meaningless. For supply and demand are but relative terms. The
          supply of labor can only mean labor offered in exchange for labor,
          or the produce of labor, and the demand for labor can only mean labor
          or the produce of labor offered in exchange for labor. Supply is thus
          demand, and demand supply, and in the whole community, one must be
          coextensive with the other. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html"> Book

THUS, although they may from time to time alter in relation to each other, as
the circumstances which determine relative levels change, yet it is evident that
wages in all strata must ultimately depend upon wages in the lowest and widest
stratum &#8212; the general rate of wages rising or falling as these rise or
fall. <br>
          <br>
Now, the primary and fundamental occupations, upon which, so to speak, all others
are built up, are evidently those which procure wealth directly from nature;
hence the law of wages in them must be the general law of wages. And, as wages
in such occupations clearly depend upon what labor can produce at the lowest
point of natural productiveness to which it is habitually applied; therefore,
wages generally depend upon the margin of cultivation, or, to put it more exactly,
upon the highest point of natural productiveness to which labor is free to apply
itself without the payment of rent. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html"> Book

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">        </span> LABOR may be likened to a man who as he carries home his earnings
        is waylaid by a series of robbers. One demands this much, and another
        that much, but last of all stands one who demands all that is left, save
        just enough to enable the victim to maintain life and come forth next
        day to work. So long as this last robber remains, what will it benefit
        such a man to drive off any or all of the other robbers? <br>
    <br>
Such is the situation of labor today throughout the civilized world. And the
robber that takes all that is left, is private property in land. Improvement,
no matter how great, and reform, no matter how beneficial in itself, cannot help
that class who, deprived of all right to the use of the material elements, have
only the power to labor &#8212; a power as useless in itself as a sail without
wind, a pump without water, or a saddle without a horse. &#8212; <em>Protection

THERE is but one way to remove an evil &#8212; and that is, to remove its cause.
Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>while
productive power grows, because land, which is the source of all wealth and the
field of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate poverty, to make wages what
justice commands they should be, the full earnings of the laborer, we must therefore
substitute for the individual ownership of land a common ownership. Nothing else
will go to the cause of the evil &#8212; in nothing else is there the slightest

        <p>AND will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose
          that lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox
          that treadeth out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift,
          and skill, their natural reward, full and unimpaired? For there is
          to the community also a natural reward. The law of society is, each
          for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep to himself the good
          he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive enterprise,
          besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral advantages
          to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
          the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there
          is a gain to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited
          by the increased supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far
          and wide; the rain which it helps to attract falls not alone on his
          field; and, even to the eye which rests upon it from a distance, it
          brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything else. The building
          of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others besides
          those who get the direct profits. Nature laughs at a miser. He is like
          the squirrel who buries his nuts and refrains from digging them up
          again. Lo! they sprout and grow into trees. In fine linen, steeped
          in costly spices, the mummy is laid away. Thousands and thousands of
          years thereafter, the Bedouin cooks his food by a fire of its encasings,
          it generates the steam by which the traveler is whirled on his way,
          or it passes into far-off lands to gratify the curiosity of another
          race. The bee fills the hollow tree with honey, and along comes the

        <p>CONSIDER the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
          would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing
          with each other for employment, and in their competition cutting down
          wages to the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere
          be competing for laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings
          of labor. For into the labor market would have entered the greatest
          of all competitors for the employment of labor, a competitor whose
          demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the demand
          of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to bid
          against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade
          and increased profits, but against the ability of laborers to become
          their own employers upon the natural opportunities freely opened to
          them by the tax which prevented monopolization. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html"> &#8212; Book

        <p>SHORT-SIGHTED is the philosophy which counts on selfishness as the
          master motive of human action. It is blind to facts of which the world
          is full. It sees not the present, and reads not the past aright. If
          you would move men to action, to what shall you appeal? Not to their
          pockets, but to their patriotism; not to selfishness but to sympathy.
          Self-interest is, as it were, a mechanical force &#8212; potent, it
          is true; capable of large and wide results. But there is in human nature
          what may be likened to a chemical force; which melts and fuses and
          overwhelms; to which nothing seems impossible. "All that a man hath
          will he give for his life" &#8212; that is self-interest. But in loyalty
          to higher impulses men will give even life. <br>
              <br>
It is not selfishness that enriches the annals of every people with heroes and
saints. It is not selfishness that on every page of the world's history; bursts
out in sudden splendor of noble deeds or sheds the soft radiance of benignant
lives. It was not selfishness that turned Gautama's back to his royal home or
bade the Maid of Orleans lift the sword from the altar; that held the Three Hundred
in the Pass of Thermopylae, or gathered into Winkelried's bosom the sheaf of
spears; that chained Vincent de Paul to the bench of the galley, or brought little
starving children during the Indian famine tottering to the relief stations with
yet weaker starvelings in their arms! Call it religion, patriotism, sympathy,
the enthusiasm for humanity, or the love of God &#8212; give it what name you
will; there is yet a force which overcomes and drives out selfishness; a force
which is the electricity of the moral universe; a force beside which all others
are weak. Everywhere that men have lived it has shown its power, and today, as
ever, the world is full of it. To be pitied is the man who has never seen and
never felt it. Look around! among common men and women, amid the care and the
struggle of daily life in the jar of the noisy street and amid the squalor where
want hides &#8212; everywhere, and there is the darkness lighted with the tremulous
play of its lambent flames. He who has not seen it has walked with shut eyes.
He who looks may see, as says Plutarch, that "the soul has a principle of kindness
in itself, and is born to love, as well as to perceive, think, or remember." <br>
              <br>
And this force of forces &#8212; that now goes to waste or assumes perverted
forms &#8212; we may use for the strengthening and building up and ennobling
of society, if we but will, just as we now use physical forces that once seemed
but powers of destruction. All we have to do is but to give it freedom and scope. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html"> &#8212; Book

THE efficiency of labor always increases with the habitual wages of labor &#8212; for
high wages mean increased self-respect, intelligence, hope and energy. Man is
not a machine, that will do so much and no more; he is not an animal, whose powers
may reach thus far and no further. It is mind, not muscle, which is the great
agent of production. The physical power evolved in the human frame is one of
the weakest of forces, but for the human intelligence the resistless currents
of nature flow, and matter becomes plastic to the human will. To increase the
comforts, and leisure, and independence of the masses is to increase their intelligence;
it is to bring the brain to the aid of the hand; it is to engage in the common
work of life the faculty which measures the animalcule and traces the orbits
of the stars!&nbsp; &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp092.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp092.html"> &#8212; Book

        <p><strong><em>b. Normal Effect of Social Progress upon Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
        <p>In the foregoing charts the effect of social growth is ignored, it
          being assumed that the given expenditure of labor force does not become
          more productive.93 Let us now try to illustrate that effect, upon the
          supposition that social growth increases the productive power of the
          given expenditure of labor force as applied to the first closed space,
          to 100; as applied to the second, to 50; as applied to the third, to
          10; as applied to the fourth, to 3, and as applied to the open space,
          to 1. 94 If there were no increased demand for land the chart would
          then be like this: [chart]</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">93. &quot;The effect of increasing population upon
              the distribution of wealth is to increase rent .. . in two ways:
              First, By lowering the margin of cultivation. Second, By bringing
              out in land special capabilities otherwise latent, and by attaching
              special capabilities to particular lands.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am disposed to think that the latter mode,
              to which little attention has been given by political economists,
              is really the more important.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty,
              book iv, ch. iii.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;When we have inquired what it is that marks
              off land from those material things which we regard as products
              of the land, we shall find that the fundamental attribute of land
              is its extension. The right to use a piece of land gives command
              over a certain space &#8212; a certain part of the earth's surface.
              The area of the earth is fixed; the geometric relations in which
              any particular part of it stands to other parts are fixed. Man
              has no control over them; they are wholly unaffected by demand;
              they have no cost of production; there is no supply price at which
              they can be produced.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;The use of a certain area of the earth's surface
              is a primary condition of anything that man can do; it gives him
              room for his own actions, with the enjoyment of the heat and the
              light, the air and the rain which nature assigns to that area;
              and it determines his distance from, and in great measure his relations
              to, other things and other persons. We shall find that it is this
              property of land, which, though as yet insufficient prominence
              has been given to it, is the ultimate cause of the distinction
              which all writers are compelled to make between land and other
              things.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's Prin., book iv, ch. ii, sec. i.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">94. Of course social growth does not go on in this
              regular way; the charts are merely illustrative. They are intended
              to illustrate the universal fact that as any land becomes a center
              of trade or other social relationship its value rises.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Though Rent is now increased, so are Wages. Both benefit by social
          growth. But if we consider the fact that increase in the productive
          power of labor increases demand for land we shall see that the tendency
          of Wages (as a proportion of product if not as an absolute quantity)
          is downward, while that of Rent is upward. 95 And this conclusion is
          confirmed by observation. 96</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">95. &quot;Perhaps it may be well to remind the reader,
              before closing this chapter, of what has been before stated &#8212; that
              I am using the word wages not in the sense of a quantity, but in
              the sense of a proportion. When I say that wages fall as rent rises,
              I do not mean that the quantity of wealth obtained by laborers
              as wages is necessarily less, but that the proportion which it
              bears to the whole produce is necessarily less. The proportion
              may diminish while the quantity remains the same or increases.&quot; &#8212; Progress
              and Poverty, book iii, ch. vi.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">96. The condition illustrated in the last chart
              would be the result of social growth if all land but that which
              was in full use were common land. The discovery of mines, the development
              of cities and towns, and the construction of railroads, the irrigation
              of and places, improvements in government, all the infinite conveniences
              and laborsaving devices that civilization generates, would tend
              to abolish poverty by increasing the compensation of labor, and
              making it impossible for any man to be in involuntary idleness,
              or underpaid, so long as mankind was in want. If demand for land
              increased, Wages would tend to fall as the demand brought lower
              grades of land into use; but they would at the same time tend to
              rise as social growth added new capabilities to the lower grades.
              And it is altogether probable that, while progress would lower
              Wages as a proportion of total product, it would increase them
              as an absolute quantity.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></font></p>

        <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law,
          99 thereby creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon
          society alone, therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has
          provided bountifully, nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility
          for poverty and fear of poverty.</p>

        <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning
          with the white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take
          possession of the best land. But instead of leaving for others what
          they do not themselves need for use, as in the previous illustrations,
          they appropriate the whole space, using only part, but claiming ownership
          of the rest. We may distinguish the used part with red color, and that
          which is appropriated without use with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
        <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than
          is used? Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit
          of future social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our
          system of confiscating Rent from the community that earns it, and giving
          it to land-owners who, as such, earn nothing.100</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago
              a workman in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession
              of it after much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for
              his &quot;find.&quot; But the owner of the land on which the meteorite
              fell claimed the money, and the two went to law about it. After
              an appeal to the highest court of the State, it was finally decided
              that neither by right of discovery, nor by right of labor, could
              the workman have the money, because the title to the meteorite
              was in the man who owned the land upon which it fell.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
          of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
          chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either
          to go upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How
          much will they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for
          use and not to hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents
          the full difference between its productiveness and the productiveness
          of the next best. But if the first-comers, reasoning that the next
          best land will soon be scarce and theirs will then rise in value, refuse
          to sell or to rent at that valuation, the newcomers must resort to
          land of the second grade, though the best be as yet only partly used.
          Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent before it otherwise
          would.</p>
        <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it
          cannot be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by
          the superiority of the best land over that which can be had for nothing,
          and the chart may be made to show it: [chart]</p>
        <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land
          in securing more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor
          force, a rush is made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it
          that it is wanted, but to enable its appropriators to put Rent into
          their own pockets as soon as growing demand for land makes it valuable.101
          We may, for illustration, suppose that all the remainder of the second
          space and the whole of the third are thus appropriated, and note the
          effect: [chart]</p>
        <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there
          is no increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land
          for higher prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like
          owning lots in the moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable.
          But let more land be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a
          different appearance. The new labor must either go to the space that
          yields but 1, or buy or rent from owners of better grades, or hire
          out. The effect would be the same in any case. Nobody for the given
          expenditure of labor force would get more than 1; the surplus of products
          would go to landowners as Rent, either directly in rent payments, or
          indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>

              is, capitalized for the purpose of selling the right to enjoy it,
              and it is to selling value that we usually refer when dealing in

              will be the capitalization of its present or prospective power
              of producing Rent. In fact, much the larger proportion of laud
              that has a selling value is wholly or partly unused, producing
              no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used. This condition

              for it or for its use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual
              sense &#8212; is purely relative. It exists from and is measured
              by the power of obtaining things for things by exchanging them.
              . . Utility is necessary to value, for nothing can be valuable
              unless it has the quality of gratifying some physical or mental
              desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But utility of

              of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having
              some form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable,

              see that with most of the things that have value this difficulty
              or ease of getting them, which determines value, depends on the
              amount of labor which must be expended in producing them ; i.e.,
              bringing them into the place, form and condition in which they
              are desired. . . Value is simply an expression of the labor required

              to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by labor, yet
              land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made on it,
              often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
              facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as
              the rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the
              universal law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced
              by labor, from a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate
              structure and appurtenances of a first-class ocean steamer, is
              resolvable on analysis into an equivalent of the labor required
              to produce such a thing in form and place; while the value of things
              not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible of ownership,
              is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the labor which
              the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed

        <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential
          Rent. Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space,
          but the owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor
          Wages is actually produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
        <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
          with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
          of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space
          above the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a
          system which confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land
          for speculative purposes becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum
          long before they would if land were appropriated only for use.</p>
        <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we
          have as yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume
          as before (page 73), that social growth increases the productive power
          of the given expenditure of labor force to 100 when applied to the
          best land, 50 when applied to the next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the
          next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would not be benefited now, as it
          appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated the appropriation of
          land for use only, although much less land is actually used. The prizes
          which expectation of future social growth dangles before men as the
          rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more than
          ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken
          up in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would
          be crowded out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but
          which in consequence of increased labor power now yields as much as
          the poorest closed space originally yielded, namely, 1 to the given
          expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would then be reduced to the present
          productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>

        <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the

          below 1; but neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive
          power may increase, so long as it pays to hold land for higher values.
          Some laborers would continually be pushed back to land which increased
          productive power would have brought up in productiveness from 0 to
          1, and by perpetual competition for work would so regulate the labor
          market that the given expenditure of labor force, however much it produced,
          could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this tendency would
          persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite increase
          in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
          increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all
          laborers to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it
          over and over again as progress went on and lower and lower grades
          of land were monopolized, until human endurance could go no further.104

              that they do not increase the profits of the farmer or the wages
              of his laborers, but that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition

              of cultivation.&quot; This is true not alone of improvements in

          <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in
              commodities, the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional
              supplies, cannot limit the speculative advance in land values,
              as land is a fixed quantity, which human agency can neither increase
              nor diminish; but there is nevertheless a limit to the price of
              land, in the minimum required by labor and capital as the condition
              of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
              reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
              increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages
              cannot be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers
              will consent to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point
              at which capital will be devoted to production, there is a limit
              which restrains the speculative advance of rent. Hence, speculation
              cannot have the same scope to advance rent in countries where wages
              and interest are already near the minimum, as in countries where
              they are considerably above it. Yet that there is in all progressive
              countries a constant tendency in the speculative advance of rent
              to overpass the limit where production would cease, is, I think,

        <p><em>Q29. Under the single tax could employers cut wages to the starvation
            point?</em><br>
A. No. Under the single tax employers would be constantly bidding for workmen,
instead of workmen constantly bidding for employers as is the case now. It is
the &quot;oversupply&quot; of labor that makes starvation wages possible, and
the single tax would abolish that; not by reducing the supply of labor, the Malthusian
device, but by allowing the effective demand for labor to freely increase.</p>
        <p><em>Q34. Would the single tax benefit the debtor class? If so, how?</em><br>
          A. It would. By abolishing the monopoly of opportunities to work, and
            thus enabling debtors to earn enough, while decently supporting themselves,
            to honestly pay their debts. The debtor class deserves sympathy,
            not because it is in debt, but because it is forced by existing institutions
            to go into debt in order to work, and is then so hampered and harried
            by the same institutions as to make orderly repayment impossible
            and bankruptcy inevitable.</p>

            is no other test.</p>
        <p><em>Q42. Does not the growth of a community increase the value of
            other things as well as of land? For example, does it not add to
            the value of the services of professional men, or of any other business
            that is dependent upon the presence and growth of the community,
            as truly as it does to the value of land?</em><br>
A. Granted that the growth of a community primarily tends to increase profits,
the increased profits tend in turn to attract men there to share them. This intensifies
competition and tends to lower profits. At the same time it increases demand
for land and tends to enhance the value of that. It therefore cannot be said
that the growth of a community finally increases the value of other things as
well as of land. In fact it does not. Appropriate houses in cities are no dearer
than appropriate houses in the country, differences in cost of production being
allowed for. And although some professional men get very high wages in thickly
populated cities, the average comfort of professional men in cities is no higher
than in the country, if as high. Moreover, even if labor values as well as land
values were increased by communal growth, it must never be forgotten that labor
values must always be worked for by the individual, whereas land values are never
worked for by the individual. A lawyer may command enormous fees, but he gets
no fee at all unless he works for it; but when land commands enormous rent the
owner gets it without doing the slightest work. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

        <p><em>Q30. How would the single tax increase wages?</em><br>
          A. By gradually transferring to wages that portion of the current wealth
            that now flows to privilege. In other words, it would widen and deepen
            the channel of wages by enlarging opportunities for labor, and by
            increasing the purchasing power of nominal wages through reduction
            of prices. On the other hand it would narrow the channel of privilege
            by making the man who has a privilege pay for it.</p>
        <p><em>Q31. How can this transfer be effected?</em><br>
          A. By the taxation of privilege.</p>
        <p><em>Q32. How much ultimately may wages be thus increased?</em><br>
          A. Fifty percent would be a low estimate.</p>
        <p><em>Q33. What are fair prices and fair wages?</em><br>
          A. Prices unenhanced by privilege, and wages undiminished by taxation.</p>
        <p><em>Q58. What expected result of the single tax needs studious emphasis?</em><br>
          A. That it would unlock the land to labor at its present value for
            use, instead of locking out labor from the land by a prohibitive
            price based upon the future value for use. ... <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">While he was working at the case, too, there
      happened one of those trivial incidents that turn out to be important in
      setting the course of one&#8217;s
            life. He heard an old printer say that in a new country wages are always
            high, while in an old country they are always low. George was struck
            by this remark and on thinking it over, he saw that it was true. Wages
            were certainly higher in the United States than in Europe, and he remembered
            that they were higher in Australia than in England. More than this, they
            were higher in the newer parts than in the older parts of the same country &#8212; higher
            in Oregon and California, for instance, than in New York and Pennsylvania.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">George used to say that this was the first
      little puzzle in political economy that ever came his way. He did not give
      it any thought until
              long after; in fact, he says he did not begin to think intently
      on any economic subject until conditions in California turned his mind
      that
              way. When finally he did so, however, the old printer&#8217;s words
              came back to him as a roadmark in his search for the cause of industrial
              depressions,
              and the cause of inequality in the distribution of wealth. ... </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">So it went. Every turn of public affairs brought
      up the old haunting questions. Even here in California he was now seeing
      symptoms of the
            same inequality that had oppressed him in New York. &#8220;Bonanza kings&#8221; were
            coming to the front, and four ex-shopkeepers of Sacramento, Stanford,
            Crocker, Huntington, and Hopkins, were laying up immense fortunes
            out of the Central Pacific. The <a href="Railroads.html">railway</a> was
            bringing in population and commodities, which everybody thought was a
            good thing all round, yet wages were going down, exactly as the old printer
            in Philadelphia had said, and the masses were growing worse off instead
            of better.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">About this matter of wages, George had had
      other testimony besides the old printer&#8217;s. On his way to Oregon a dozen years before, he fell
            in with a lot of miners who were talking about the Chinese, and ventured
            to ask what harm the Chinese were doing as long as they worked only the
            cheap diggings. &#8220;No harm now,&#8221; one of the miners said, &#8220;but
            wages will not always be as high as they are today in California. <a href="Population_Growth.html">As
            the country grows, as people come in, wages will go down</a>, and
            some day or other white people will be glad to get those diggings
            that the
            Chinamen are working.&#8221; George said that this idea, coming on top
            of what the printer had said, made a great impression on him &#8212; the
            idea that &#8220;<a href="Progress.html">as the country grew
            in all that we are hoping that it might grow</a>, the condition of
            those who had to work for their living must become, not better, but
            worse.&#8221; Yet
            in the short space of a dozen years this was precisely what was taking
            place before his own eyes.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Still, though his two great questions became
      more and more pressing, he could not answer them. His thought was still
      inchoate. He went around
            and around his ultimate answer, like somebody fumbling after something
            on a table in the dark, often actually touching it without being
      aware that it was what he was after. Finally it came to him in a burst
      of true
            Cromwellian or Pauline drama out of &#8220;the commonplace reply of a
            passing teamster to a commonplace question.&#8221; One day in 1871
            he went for a horseback ride, and as he stopped to rest his horse
            on a rise
            overlooking San Francisco Bay &#8212;</div>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">&#8220;I asked a passing teamster, for want of something better to
                say, what land was worth there. He pointed to some cows grazing so
                far off that they looked like mice, and said, &#8217;I don&#8217;t
                know exactly, but there is a man over there who will sell some land
                for a thousand dollars an acre.&#8217; Like a flash it came over
                me that there was the reason of advancing poverty with advancing
                wealth. <a href="Population_Growth.html">With
                the growth of population</a>, land grows in value, and the men
                who work it must pay more for the privilege.&#8221;</div>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Yes, there it was. Why had wages suddenly shot up so high in California
            in 1849 that cooks in the restaurants of San Francisco got $500 a month?
            The reason now was simple and clear. It was because the placer mines
            were found on <a href="Land_Common_Property.html">land that
            did not belong to anybody</a>. Any one could go to them and work them
            without having to pay an owner for the privilege. If the lands had been
            owned by somebody, it would have been land-values instead of wages that
            would have so suddenly shot up.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Exactly this was what had taken place on these
      grazing lands overlooking San Francisco Bay. The Central Pacific meant
      to make its terminus at
            Oakland, the increased population would need the land around Oakland
            to settle on, and land values had jumped up to a thousand dollars
      an acre. Naturally, then, George reasoned, the more public improvements
            there were, the better the transportation facilities, the larger
      the
            population, the more industry and commerce &#8212; the more of everything
            that makes for &#8220;prosperity&#8221; &#8212; the more would land
            values tend to rise, and the more would wages and interest tend to
            fall.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">George rode home thoughtful, translating the
      teamster&#8217;s commonplace
            reply into the technical terms of economics. He reasoned that there
      are <a href="Three-Factor_Economics.html">three
            factors in the production of wealth</a>, and only three: natural
            resources, labor, and capital. When natural resources are unappropriated,
            obviously
            the whole yield of production is divided into wages, which go to
            labor, and interest, which goes to capital. But when they are appropriated,
            production has to carry a third charge &#8212; <a href="../themes/Rent.html">rent</a>.
            Moreover, wages and interest, when there is no rent, are regulated
            strictly by free competition; but rent is a monopoly-charge, and
            hence is always &#8220;all
            the traffic will bear.&#8221;</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Well, then, since <a href="Natural_Resources.html">natural
              resource values</a> are purely social in their origin, created
              by the community, should not rent go to the community rather than
              to the Individual? <a href="Untaxing.html">Why
              tax industry and enterprise at all</a> &#8212; why not just charge
              rent? There would be no need to interfere with the private ownership
              of natural resources. Let a man own all of them he can get his
              hands on, and make as much out of them as he may, untaxed; but
              let him pay
              the community their annual rental value, determined simply by what
              other people would be willing to pay for the use of the same holdings.
              George could see justification for wages and interest, on the ground
              of natural right; and for private ownership of natural resources,
              on the ground of public policy; but he could see none for the private
              appropriation of economic rent. In his view it was sheer <a href="Theft.html">theft</a>.
              If he was right, then it also followed that as long as economic
              rent remains unconfiscated, <a href="Piracy.html">the taxation
              of industry and enterprise is pure highwaymanry</a>, especially <a href="../themes/Tariffs.html">tariff</a> taxation,
              for this virtually delegates the government&#8217;s taxing power
              to private persons. ...<a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">read the

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><font size="-1">3. THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH</font></strong></p>
        <p>The chart on the following page displays the fundamental principle
          of Production, which we considered at the beginning, and also the fundamental
          principle of Distribution, which is yet to be considered. In the development
          of the latter will be found the explanation of the divorce in the civilized
          state of Labor from Land: [chart]</p>
        <p> This chart reminds us that Labor (human exertion), by application
          to Land (natural materials and forces external to man), produces Wealth
          (the generic term for all those things that tend to satisfy the material
          Wants of man), and so tends to abolish poverty. No man's poverty can
          be abolished in any other way, unless it be by gifts, or vulgar robbery,
          or legalized spoils.</p>
        <p>The chart shows also that Wealth distributes ultimately in Wages 82
          (a fund made up of the aggregate of the earnings of individual laborers),
          which corresponds to Labor; and Rent 83 (a fund made up of the aggregate
          premiums for specially desirable locations), which corresponds to Land.84</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">82. &quot;What is paid for labor of any kind is
              called wages. We are apt to speak of the payment given to the common
              day laborer only as wages; and we give finer names to the payments
              which are made for some other kinds of services. Thus we speak
              of the doctor's or the lawyer's fee; of the judge's salary; of
              the teacher's income; of the merchant's profit; of the banker's
              interest, and of the professor's emoluments. They are all in reality
              only payments for labor of different kinds, or for different results
              of labor, &#8212; that is, they are all wages.&quot; &#8212; Dick's
              Outlines, p. 23</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;Wages is what goes to pay for all the trouble
              of labor.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's Primer, sec. 39</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;His [the manager's] share is called the wages
              of superintendence, and although usually much larger than the share
              of a common laborer, it is really wages of the same nature.&quot; &#8212; Id.,
              sec. 41.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;The common meaning of the word wages is the
              compensation paid to a hired person for manual labor. But in political
              economy the word wages has a much wider meaning, and includes all
              returns for exertion. For, as political economists explain, the
              three agents or factors in production are land, labor, and capital,
              and that part of the produce which goes to the second of these
              factors is styled by them wages. . . It is important to keep this
              in mind. For in the standard economic works this sense of the term
              wages is recognized with greater or less clearness only to be subsequently
              ignored.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book i, ck. ii.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">83. Rent &quot;is what is paid for the use of a
              natural agent, whether land, or beds of minerals, or rivers, or
              lakes. The rent of a house or factory is, therefore, not all rent
              in our meaning of the word.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's Primer, sec.
              40.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;The term rent in its economic sense . . .
              differs in meaning from the word rent as commonly used. In some
              respects this economic meaning is narrower than the common meaning;
              in other respects it is wider.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;It is narrower in this: In common speech,
              we apply the word rent to payments for the use of buildings, machinery,
              fixtures, etc., as well as to payments for the use of land or other
              natural capabilities; and in speaking of the rent of a house or
              the rent of a farm, we do not separate the price for the use of
              the improvements from the price for the use of the bare land. But
              in the economic meaning of rent, payments for the use of any of
              the products of human exertion are excluded, and of the lumped
              payments for the use of houses, farms, etc., only that part is
              rent which constitutes the consideration for the use of the land &#8212; that
              part paid for the use of buildings or other improvements being
              properly interest, as it is a consideration for the use of capital.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;It is wider in this: In common speech we only
              speak of rent when owner and user are distinct persons. But in
              the economic sense there is also rent where the same person is
              both owner and user. Where owner and user are thus the same person,
              whatever part of his income he might obtain by letting the land
              to another is rent, while the return for his labor and capital
              are that part of his income which they would yield him did he hire
              instead of owning the land. Rent is also expressed in a selling
              price. When land is purchased, the payment which is made for the
              ownership, or right to perpetual use, is rent commuted or capitalized.
              If I buy land for a small price and hold it until I can sell it
              for a large price, I have become rich, not by wages for my labor
              or by interest upon my capital, but by the increase of rent.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;Rent, in short, is the share in the wealth
              produced which the exclusive right to the use of natural capabilities
              gives to the owner. Wherever land has an exchange value there is
              rent in the economic meaning of the term. Wherever land having
              a value is used, either by owner or hirer, there is rent actual;
              wherever it is not used, but still has a value, there is rent potential.
              It is this capacity of yielding rent which gives value to land.
              Until its ownership will confer some advantage, land has no value.&quot; &#8212; Progress
              and Poverty, book iii, chap ii</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">84. &quot;The primary division of wealth in distribution
              is dual, not tripartite. Capital is but a form of labor, and its
              distinction from labor is in reality but a subdivision, just as
              the division of labor into skilled and unskilled would be. In our
              examination we have reached the same point as would have been attained
              had we simply treated capital as a form of labor, and sought the
              law which divides the produce between rent and wages; that is to
              say, between the possessors of the two factors, natural substances
              and powers, and human exertion &#8212; which two factors by their
              union produce all wealth.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book

              of house building. But economic Rent is not compensation for anything;
              it is simply the premiums for advantages of location.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></font></p>

        <p><em>Q25. What good would the single tax do to the poor? and how?</em><br>
A. By constantly keeping the demand for labor above the supply it would enable
  them to abolish their poverty.</p>
        <p><em>Q27. Would working people, whose savings are in savings banks or insurance
          companies which own land or have mortgages upon land, lose by the shrinkage
          in land values?</em><br>
          A. Not if the companies were managed intelligently. Well managed companies
          would shift their investments as they observed the persistent decline
          of land values. They would do it even as soon as conditions appeared
          which would naturally cause land values to shrink. But working people
          could well afford to give all their savings for the permanent employment
          and high wages that the single tax would bring about. It is not working
          people but idle people who would lose anything by the single tax.</p>

                                when the facts are that a larger and larger proportion of women and
                                children are forced to toil.</span> Why, I am told that, even here in

                                factories. In Detroit, according to the report of the Michigan Bureau
                                of Labour Statistics, one half of the children of school age do not
                                go to school. In New Jersey, the report made to the legislature
                                discloses an amount of misery and ignorance that is appalling.
                                Children are growing up there, compelled to monotonous toil when they
                                ought to be at play, children who do not know how to play; children
                                who have been so long accustomed to work that they have become used
                                to it; children growing up in such ignorance that they do not know
                                what country New Jersey is in, that they never heard of George
                                Washington, that some of them think Europe is in New York.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Such facts
                                are appalling; they mean that the very foundations of the Republic
                                are being sapped. The dangerous man is not the man who tries to
                                excite discontent; the dangerous man is the man who says that all is
                                as it ought to be. </span>Such a state of things cannot continue; such
                                tendencies as we see at work here cannot go on without bringing at

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We talk about over-production.
                                How can there be such a thing as
                                over-production while people want? All these things that are said to
                                be over-produced are desired by many people. Why do they not get
                                them? They do not get them because they have not the means to buy
                                them; not that they do not want them. Why have not they the means to
                                buy them? They earn too little. When the great masses of men have to
                                work for an average of $1.40 a day, it is no wonder that great
          quantities of goods cannot be sold. </small></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now why is it that men have to
                                work for such low wages? Because
                                if they were to demand higher wages there are plenty of unemployed
                                men ready to step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed
                                men who compel that fierce competition that drives wages down to the
                                point of bare subsistence. Why is it that there are men who cannot
                                get employment? Did you ever think what a strange thing it is that
                                men cannot find employment? Adam had no difficulty in finding
                                employment; neither had Robinson Crusoe; the finding of employment
          was the last thing that troubled them. </small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If men cannot find an employer,
                                why cannot they employ
                                themselves? Simply because they are shut out from the element on
                                which human labour can alone be exerted. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Men are compelled to compete
                                with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been
                                robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves; because
                                they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
                                paving some other human creature for the privilege.&nbsp; </span>...<a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html"> <span

                                can employ themselves wherever the natural opportunities for
          employment are not shut up from them.</small></div>

                                given by their Creator, to demand opportunity to employ themselves.
                                And whenever that right is acknowledged, whenever the people who want
                                to go to work can find natural opportunities to work upon, then there
                                will be as much competition among employers who are anxious to get
                                people to work for them, as there will be among people who are

                                relations to the world in which he is placed are such &#8211; that is to say,
                                the immutable laws of God are such that it is beyond the power of human
                                ingenuity to devise any way by which the evils born of the injustice

          opening to all the bounty that God has provided for all! </small></div>

                                taken, and on which he must draw for all that he can produce &#8211; does it
                                not irresistibly follow that to give the land in ownership to some men
                                and to deny to others all right to it is to divide mankind into the
          rich and the poor, the privileged and the helpless?</small></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Does it not follow that those
                                who have no rights to the use of
          land can live only by selling their labor to those who own the land? </small></div>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Does it not follow that what the

                                of wages,&#8221; what the political economists term &#8220;the tendency of wages to
                                a minimum,&#8221; must take from the landless mass of mere laborers &#8211; who of
                                themselves have no power to use their labor &#8211; the benefits of any
          advance or improvement that does not alter this unjust division of land?</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Having
                                no Power to employ themselves, they must, either as labor-sellers or
                                land-renters, compete with one another for permission
                                to labor; <span style="font-weight: bold;">and this competition with
                                one another of men shut out from
                                God&#8217;s inexhaustible storehouse, must ultimately force wages to their
          lowest point, the point at which life can just be maintained.</span></small></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is not to say that all
                                wages must fall to this point, but
                                that the wages of that necessarily largest stratum of laborers who
                                have only ordinary knowledge, skill, and aptitude, must so fall. The
                                wages of special classes, who are fenced off from the pressure of
                                competition by peculiar knowledge, skill, or other causes, may remain
          above that ordinary level.</small></div>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus,
                                where the ability to read and write is rare its
                                possession enables a man to obtain higher wages than the ordinary
                                laborer. But as the diffusion of education makes the ability to read
                                and write general, this advantage is lost. So, when a vocation requires
                                special training or skill, or is made difficult of access by artificial
                                restrictions, the checking of competition tends to keep wages in it at
                                a higher level. But as the progress of invention dispenses with
                                peculiar skill, or artificial restrictions are broken dawn, these
                                higher wages sink to the ordinary level. And so, it is only so long as
                                they are special that such qualities as industry, prudence, and thrift
                                can enable the ordinary laborer to maintain a condition above that
                                which gives a mere living. Where they become general, the law of
                                competition must eventually reduce the earnings or savings of such
          qualities to the general level.</small></p>

                                being necessary to life and labor, where private

                                landless class, there is no possible invention or improvement, whether
                                it be industrial, social, or moral, which, so long as it does not
                                affect the ownership of land can prevent poverty or relieve the general

                                regulate the rates of interest. Usury laws have been tried again and
                                again, but the only effect they have ever had has been to increase what
                                the poorer borrowers must pay, and for the same reasons that all
                                attempts to lower by regulation the price of goods have always resulted
          merely in increasing their price.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The general rate of wages is fixed
                                by the ease or difficulty

                                That of applying his own labor to the inexhaustible storehouse which

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is often assumed that there is

                                content to receive; and it is imagined that if this were secured there
                                would be an end of strife. This rate is thought of as that which will
                                give workingmen a frugal living, and perhaps enable them by hard work
          and strict economy to lay by a little something.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But how can a just rate of wages
                                be fixed without the

        <div style="text-align: left;"><B>The answer of the current political economy is, that wages are fixed by
          the ratio between the number of laborers and the amount of capital devoted
          to the employment of labor, and constantly tend to the lowest amount on which
          laborers will consent to live and reproduce, because the increase in the
          number of laborers tends naturally to follow and overtake any increase in
          capital. </B>The increase of the divisor being thus held in check only by

        <div style="text-align: left;">In current thought this doctrine holds all but undisputed sway. It bears the
          indorsement of the very highest names among the cultivators of political economy,
          and though there have been attacks upon it, they are generally more formal
          than real.* It is assumed by Buckle as the basis of his generalizations of
          universal history. It is taught in all, or nearly all, the great English and
          American universities, and is laid down in textbooks which aim at leading the
          masses to reason correctly upon practical affairs, while it seems to harmonize
          with the new philosophy, which, having in a few years all but conquered the

          <p><FONT SIZE="-2">* This seems to me true of Mr. Thornton's objections,
              for while he denies the existence of a predetermined wage fund, consisting
              of a portion of capital set apart for the purchase of labor, he yet holds
              (which is the essential thing) that wages are drawn from capital, and that
              increase or decrease of capital is increase or decrease of the fund available
              for the payment of wages. The most vital attack upon the wage fund doctrine
              of which I know is that of Professor Francis A. Walker ("The Wages Question",
              New York, 1876), yet he admits that wages are in large part advanced from
              capital - which, so far as it goes, is all that the stanchest supporter
              of the wage fund theory could claim while he fully accepts the Malthusian
              theory. Thus his practical conclusions in nowise differ from those reached
              by expounders of the current theory.</FONT></p>

        <div style="text-align: left;">Thus entrenched in the upper regions of thought, it is in cruder form even
          more firmly rooted in what may be styled the lower. <B>What gives to the fallacies
          of protection such a tenacious hold, in spite of their evident inconsistencies
          and absurdities, is the idea that the sum to be distributed in wages is in
          each community a fixed one, which the competition of "foreign labor" must still
          further subdivide. </B>The same idea underlies most of the theories which aim
          at the abolition of interest and the restriction of competition, as the means
          whereby the share of the laborer in the general wealth can be increased; and
          it crops out in every direction among those who are not thoughtful enough to
          have any theories, as may be seen in the columns of newspapers and the debates
          of legislative bodies.</div>

    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>And yet, widely accepted and deeply rooted as it is, it seems to me that <B>this
        theory does not tally with obvious facts.</B> For, if wages depend upon the
        ratio between the amount of labor seeking employment and the amount of capital
        devoted to its employment, the relative scarcity or abundance of one factor
        must mean the relative abundance or scarcity of the other. Thus, capital
        must be relatively abundant where wages are high, and relatively scarce where
        wages are low. Now, as the capital used in paying wages must largely consist
        of the capital constantly seeking investment, the current rate of interest
        must be the measure of its relative abundance or scarcity. So, if it be true
        that wages depend upon the ratio between the amount of labor seeking employment
        and the capital devoted to its employment, then high wages, the mark of the
        relative scarcity of labor, must be accompanied by low interest, the mark
        of the relative abundance of capital, and reversely, low wages must be accompanied
        by high interest.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>This is not the fact, but the contrary. Eliminating
        from interest the element of insurance, and regarding only interest proper,
        or the return for the use
        of capital, is it not a general truth that interest is high where and
        when wages are high, and low where and when wages are low? Both wages
        and interest
        have been higher in the United States than in England, in the Pacific
        than in the Atlantic States. ...</p>
      <p>Now, this broad, general fact, that wages are higher in new countries,
        where capital is relatively scarce, than in old countries, where capital
        is relatively abundant, is too glaring to be ignored. And although very
        lightly touched upon, it is noticed by the expounders of the current
      political economy. ...<a href="HG/PP/02_b1_c1_current_doctrine_wages.htm">read

  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;"> As used in common discourse &quot;<strong>wages</strong>&quot; means
            a compensation paid to a hired person for his services; and we speak of
            one man &quot;working for wages,&quot; in contradistinction to another
            who is &quot;working for himself.&quot; The use of the term is still
            further narrowed by the habit of applying it solely to compensation
            paid for manual
            labor. We do not speak of the wages of professional men, managers
            or clerks, but of their fees, commissions, or salaries. Thus the
            common meaning of
            the word wages is the compensation paid to a hired person for manual
            labor. <strong>But
            in political economy the word wages has a much wider meaning, and includes
            all returns for exertion.</strong> For, as political economists explain,
            the three agents or factors in production are land, labor, and capital,
            and that part of the produce which goes to the second of these factors
          is by them styled wages.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">Thus the term <strong>labor</strong> includes all human exertion
            in the production of wealth, and wages, being that part of the produce
            which goes to labor, includes all reward for such exertion. There is, therefore,
            in the politicoeconomic sense of the term wages no distinction as to the
            kind of labor, or as to whether its reward is received through an employer
            or not, but wages means the return received for the exertion of labor,
            as distinguished from the return received for the use of capital, and the
            return received by the landholder for the use of land. The man who cultivates
            the soil for himself receives his wages in its produce, just as if he uses
            his own capital and owns his own land, he may also receive interest and
            rent; the hunter's wages are the game he kills; the fisherman's wages are
            the fish he takes. The gold washed out by the self-employing gold digger
            is as much his wages as the money paid to the hired coal miner by the purchaser
            of his labor,<font size="-1"><strong><em>1</em></strong></font> and,
            as Adam Smith shows, the high profits of retail storekeepers are
            in large part wages, being the recompense of their labor and not
            of
            their capital. In short, whatever is received as the result or reward
            of exertion is &quot;wages.&quot;</div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;"> This is all it is now necessary to note
        as to &quot;wages,&quot; but
            it is important to keep this in mind. For in the standard economic
        works this sense of the term wages is recognized with greater or less
        clearness
            only to be subsequently ignored. ... <a href="HG/PP/03_b1_c2_meaning_of_the_terms.htm">read the entire

                By far the most important is the mode in which the land is distributed.
                Wherever there is a free soil, labor maintains its value. Wherever
                the soil is in the hands of a few proprietors, or tied up by
                entails, labor necessarily undergoes depreciation. In fact, it
                is the disposition of the land that determines the value of labor.
                If men could get the land to labor on, they would manufacture
                only for a remuneration that afforded more profit than God has
                attached to the cultivation of the earth. Where they cannot get
                the land to labor on, they are starved into working for a bare
                subsistence.&quot; [Patrick Edward DOVE, Theory of Human Progression,

          Today </a></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A central feature of the British
            classical school was the
            classification of productive resources into three "factors of
            production" - labor, land, and capital. Most classical economists had
            conceived of these in terms of three great social classes (the
            workers, the landed aristocracy, and the capitalists). George, on the
            other hand, identified them as functional categories, distinguished
            by the conditions under which the factors are made available for
          production.</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a competitive economy, the
            earnings of the factors of
            production measure their separate contributions to the value of the
            product. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Payments for the use of
            labor are called wages</span>; payments for
            land are called rent; the income of capital is interest. In George's
            terms, the distress of the working classes had to do with a
            persistently low level of real wages.<span style="font-weight: bold;">
"Why," he asked, "in spite of
            increase in productive power, do wages tend to a minimum which will
          give but a bare living?"</span></small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The book proceeds
            systematically. First, George explores the
            prevailing scholarly and popular explanations, which relied
            principally on the famous population theory of Malthus, in
            combination with the "wage fund" theory of British political economy.
            Together these theories implied that the aggregate income of labor
            depends upon the amount of capital devoted to the payment of wages.
            An increase in wages required an increase in the amount of capital
            per worker. However, any rise in living standards above mere
            subsistence motivated workers to marry younger and bear more
            children, until population growth caused capital per worker - and,
            therefore, wages - to recede again.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To George, the Malthusian
            analysis was abhorrent: It asserted that
            no institutional reform could fundamentally alter the pattern of
            income distribution, and that charitable support for the needy only
            compounded the problem - by lowering death rates and raising birth
            rates. Fortunately, he found this theory of wages to be theoretically
            flawed on several grounds.</span> He also found it to be incompatible
            with
            empirical facts, based on historical case studies from Ireland,
            China, India, the United States and elsewhere. Today, most
            development economists agree with George that famine and mass poverty
            have more to do with faulty human institutions than with the
          limitations of nature.<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George emphasized that unequal
            distribution is itself wasteful of
          wealth.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Unemployment and underemployment
            of labor mean that energy and
            intelligence go untapped. For those who find work, he said, high
            wages stimulate creativity, invention, and improvement, while low
            wages encourage carelessness. Inadequate education of the poor
            multiplies the loss. There are the damages done by poverty-related
            vice and crime, and the substantial costs of protecting society
            against them. There is the burden upon the wealthy of providing
            welfare support for the very poor - or risking social upheaval if
            they do not. Moreover, said George, social institutions by which some
            prosper at others' expense cause talent and resources to be diverted
            from productive enterprise to unproductive conflict, as individuals
            find that competing for political advantage can be more lucrative
          than competing for market success.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In short, an unjust system of
            privileges and entitlements tends to
            cause misallocation of resources, macroeconomic instability and
            stagnation, political corruption, and social conflict that ultimately
          may threaten whole civilizations.</small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>George's central contribution
            was to show that the distinction

            <small>When we say that the appropriate recipient of rent is the public
            treasury, it should be understood that this is not in addition to
            existing sources of public revenue, but rather instead of existing

          return to land. This is the reason that fees for the use of land and

          source of government revenue.</small></li>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While one might call such fees

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Characteristics of Land
            </b></small><br>
            <small>Land, in an economic sense, is defined as the entire material
            universe outside of people themselves and the products of people. It
            includes all natural resources, materials, airwaves, as well as the
            ground. All air, soil, minerals and water is included in the
            definition of land. Everything that is freely supplied by nature, and
            not made by man, is categorized as land.</small>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land holds a unique and pivotal
            position in social, political,
            environmental and economic theory. Land supports all life and stands
            at the center of human culture and institutions. All people, at all
            times, must make use of land. Land has no cost of production. It is
            nature's gift to mankind, which enables life to continue and
          prosper.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land's uniqueness stems from its
            fixed supply and immobility. Land
            cannot be manufactured or reproduced. Land is required directly or
            indirectly in the production of all goods and services. Land is our
          most basic resource and the source of all wealth.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price paid
            annually for the exclusive right (a
            monopoly) to use a certain location, piece of land or other natural
            resource.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> People receive wages for
            work, capital receives interest
            for investment, and land receives rent for the exclusive use of a
            location.</span> Equity and efficiency require that the local general
            public, who created land value, should be paid for the exclusive use
          of a land site. That Payment is in the form of a land tax.</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When considering world-wide
            economics, most people think that land
            rent contributes only a small insignificant portion of value. But as
            societies progress, land has become the predominant force in
            determining the progress or poverty of all people within a community.
            Land in major or cities is so costly that people are forced to move
            further away and travel great distances in order to get to work and
            social attractions. In the more developed countries of the world,
          land rent represents more than 40% of gross annual production.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since land is fixed in supply, as
            more land is demanded by people
            the rent will increase proportionally. Demand is the sole determinant
            of land rent. Changes in land rent and land taxes have no impact on
            the supply of land, because the land supply is fixed and cannot be
            significantly expanded. Labor and capital are variable in supply. A
            higher price for commodities causes more labor and capital to make
            itself available. Labor and capital are rewarded for their work. A
            high price is an incentive to work harder and longer, while a low
          price is not an incentive to work harder and longer.&nbsp; </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><small></small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <p><small>If only a small amount of land
            rent remained to be capitalized
            after land taxes were collected, land could have a lower market
            value. It would, however, continue to have the same rental or
            productive value to the community.&nbsp;</small></p>
            <p>      <small>Not only is land rent a
              potentially important source of public
              revenue, the tax on land is a means of limiting excessive speculation
              in land prices. This would ensure that the equal opportunity to be
              productive would be available to all citizens. With limited money to
              invest, people could invest in productive equipment and wages, rather
              than in high land prices which produce no additional tangible
            wealth.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...  </span></p>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Adam Smith, in The Wealth of
            Nations, suggested that any "tax"
            should be a charge for services which benefit all people and are more
            efficiently performed by a single cooperative effort. He postulated
            four principles of taxation which any source of revenue should
          meet:</small></p>
        <blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Light on the
            production of wealth, and does not impede
            or reduce production; <br>
            2. Cheap to collect, requiring few collectors, and easy to
            understand; <br>
            3. Certain; can't be avoided, little opportunity for corruption,
            and provides adequate revenue; <br>
            4. Equitable and fair, payment for benefits received, impartial,
          and just. </small></blockquote>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Collecting public revenue from
            land rent is the only revenue
          source, or "tax", that meets these criteria. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While the major argument for
            raising public revenue from land rent
            and natural resources is because it is equitable and fair, it is also
            the most efficient method of raising the revenue which is needed for
            public facilities and services. Land is visible, can't be hidden and
            its valuation is less intrusive than valuations of income and sales.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
            Taxes on labor and capital cause people to consider alternative
            options, including working with less effort, which produces less real
            goods. For example, a tax on wages will reduce after-tax net wages
            and weaken the incentive to work. A person might be willing to work
            hard for a wage of $20 per hour, but decide to drop out if the taxes
            take $8 and the net wage is only $12 per hour. </span>Economists claim
            that
            present taxes account for a 25% loss in production in the United
            States. Production and consumption would be greatly improved if
            public revenue came primarily from land rather than a wage tax. The
            same would occur when buildings and machinery are taxed. The tax on
            building reduces the quantity and quality of buildings produced. A
            tax on sales, commerce or value added reduces consumption, production
            and net wealth. Sales tax evasion in the United States has exceeded
          30% in recent years.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As new inventions and more
            efficient ways of producing goods are
            discovered, people's economic well-being is not improved, because
            they have lost access to land and must pay both rent and taxes. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)</span>
            Instead of rent being used to provide community services, capital and
          wages must be depleted, which obstructs private enterprise.</small></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><small></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent potentially
            an important source of public
            revenue, collecting all of it would ensure that the equal opportunity
            to be productive would be available to all citizens. People could
            fund useful buildings, equipment and wages, rather than having to buy
            land at inflated prices. Many countries, including the United States,
            were started on the premise of using land rent to fund public
            services. Many countries suffer economic loss because they no longer
          collect the market rent of land.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The value of land can be estimated
            with an acceptable accuracy, at
            a cost which is very small compared to the revenue to be obtained. A
            proper system of assessment and taxation of land can provide for the
            proper economic use of the land. A land site should be available to
            the user who can make the highest and best use of the site and
            maximize the site benefits for all people. A land tax can provide a
            major source of public revenue which the local governing body could
            use for the benefit of all people. A land tax can prevent the
            dispossession of our children, the future producers in the society.
            Justice requires that land values, which are created by society and
            nature, be made available for public improvements. This is the
            responsibility of good government.<a

            Our nation was founded on the idea that we are all created equal,

            every person, and beyond that sphere our obligation to respect the
            rights of others. This Bill is concerned with the economic aspects of
          these rights and obligations.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Article 1</b>: Each person has
            the

            amount of the compensation that their employers agree to pay them.

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
            primary cause of the enormous and
            growing wealth gap is that the land and natural resources of the earth
            are treated as if they are mere market commodities from which a few are
            allowed to reap massive private profits or hold land and resources out
            of use in anticipation of future profits. </span>Henry George, the
            great 19th century American political economist and social philosopher,
            proposed a solution to a problem that too few understood at the time
            and too few understand today. Early Christian teachings drew upon deep
            wisdom teachings of the Jubilee justice tradition when they addressed
            this problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is the Land
            Problem.</span></small><br>
            <br>
            <small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
            Land
            Problem takes two primary forms: land price escalation and concentrated
            land ownership.</span> </small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small>
        </div>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As our system of economic
          development proceeds, land values rise faster than wages increase,
          until inevitably the price paid for access to land consumes increasing
          amounts of a worker's wages. In classical economics, this dilemma is
          called the "law of rent" and has been mostly ignored by mainstream
          economists. The predictability of the "law of rent" - that land values
          will continually rise - fuels frenzies of land speculation and the
          inevitable bust that follows the boom.</span> A recent <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>cover story informs us
          that there are big gains and huge risks in housing speculation in about
          30 predominantly coastal markets that encompass 100 million people.
          Since 2000, home prices in New York, Washington, and Boston have surged
          56% to 61%. Prices jumped 58% in Miami and Los Angeles and 76% in San
          Diego where the median home price county-wide is $582,000. The gap
          between home prices and fundamentals like job growth and incomes is
          greater than ever.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></small></small></li>
            <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The second form of the
          Land Problem is the
          fact that in most countries, including the United States, a small
          minority of people own and control a disproportionately large amount of
          land and natural resources.</span> Data suggests that about 3% of the
          population owns 95% of the privately held land in the US. Less than 600
          companies control 22% of our private land, a land mass the size of
          Spain. Those same companies land interests worldwide comprise a total
          area larger than that of Europe - almost 2 billion acres....&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We've just seen how returns from
            land are, by nature, monopolistic and,
            by rights, should be returned to the community. But how do we calculate
            this amount?</small><br>
            <br>
            <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHO GETS THE COCONUTS?</span></small><br>
            <small>It's perhaps best illustrated by the Robinson Crusoe scenario,
            where he
            finds himself alone on a desert island. Rob naturally settles on the
            best available land which, for argument's sake, can produce 20 coconuts
            per acre per month. Along comes Man Friday, who gets the second-best
            land producing 18 coconuts per acre. This best, freely-available land
            of Friday is called the marginal land and, as we'll see, determines
            both the level of wages and that of rent.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>For how much could Rob rent out his land - 2 coconuts or 20
            coconuts
            per acre? Friday would only be prepared to pay 2, because he can
            already get 18 from his. So here's our first definition, that of the
            Law of Rent: The application of labour and capital equipment being
            equal, the rent of land is determined by the difference between the
            value of its produce and that of the least productive land in use. So
            if Man Saturday comes along (the next day?!) and finds that the best
            available land can only produce 15 coconuts per acre, Rob could rent
            his land out to Saturday for 5 coconuts per acre, and Friday for 2.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What then determines the level
            of wages?</span>
            When Friday came along and could work land yielding 18 coconuts per
            acre in a month, then he wouldn't accept wages offered by Rob for less
            than 18 coconuts. But when Saturday arrived, suddenly Friday could only
            command 15 per month, because Rob knows that the going rate (that
            applicable to Saturday at the margin) is only 15. So here we have the
            Law of Wages, which is the corollary of the law of rent: Wages are the
            reward that labour can obtain on marginal land, i.e. the most
            productive land available to it without paying rent.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>Of course it all gets more complicated by technology, trade
            unions,
            immigration, the existence of a pool of unemployed, personal
            preferences, levels of education etc., but these strong underlying laws
            always hold. But let's now tie up the factors of production. Rent is
            the return to land, wages are the return to labour, and interest is the
            return to capital. The law of interest can be stated thus: Interest is
            the return that the use of capital equipment can obtain on marginal
            land, i.e. the most productive land available to it without paying rent.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">PROGRESS AND POVERTY, SIDE BY
            SIDE</span></small><br>
            <small>So here's the alarming paradox of progress marching side by side
            with
            poverty. Those who have grabbed the best land get richer and richer
            (from increasing rent) while the tenants and wage-earners get poorer
            and poorer for having to accept lower and lower wages as the margin is
            pushed out to less productive land). Henry George, in his classic <a
 href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>
            drove home this point, but took about 600 pages to deal with all the
            complications and fine details not examined here. It's no wonder that
            the unmasking of this great paradox - the title of his book - hit the
            19th century world like a great revelation. And it's no wonder that
            vested interests, through the neoclassical economics that they
            fostered, knew they had to shut him up. And, by successfully silencing
            him, it's no wonder that, despite all efforts, increasing and ever more
            alarming disparities of wealth are the norm world-wide.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>But, anyway, how many coconut-basketsful of LVT should we
            collect?
            Chuck away all those calculators, guys, for the answer is simple: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Collect the rent, the whole rent, and
            nothing but the rent.</span>
            Assuming that everyone has to do the same amount of work to produce
            their differing yields of coconuts, when Friday came along then we'd
            collect 2 coconuts per acre from Rob. This would leave 18 coconuts in
            each of their hands, and 2 coconuts of rent or LVT collected. When
            Saturday arrived we'd collect 5 from Rob and 3 from Friday, which would
            leave 15 coconuts in everyone's hands and 8 coconuts of rent collected.
            Result: everybody effectively shares equally in the bounty of Our One
            Earth, and we have a natural, non-punitive form of revenue raising with
            which to fund infrastructure.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>We've already seen how speculators can presently hold on to idle
            parcels of land, waiting for unearned increases in their value to
            accrue to them. But here's another curse of land speculation: by
            locking up productive land, it forces newcomers out to less productive
            land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">By "pushing back the margin", <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the evil of speculation
            simultaneously raises rents and lowers wages. </span>LVT makes it
            impossible
            for speculators to enjoy unearned income.&nbsp; ... </span></small><small><span

            Some of the benefit of abating existing taxes will lodge in higher
            after-tax wage rates, rather than higher rents.</span> For the present
            and near future, however, the supply of labor in Russia is highly
            elastic because so many potential workers are now unemployed, or
            underemployed, or occupied in crime. In this condition, raising demand
            for labor will raise payrolls by raising the number of good jobs, more
            than by raising wage rates. On balance, therefore, this effect on jobs
            will create new rents, more than it cuts into old ones. After Russia
            shall have achieved full employment, wage rates may rise and cut into
            the surplus of land rents, but if this should then create a new kind of
            problem (which I doubt), it is more pleasant, and easier to solve, than

        </big>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>High land price guides investors
        to prefer kinds of capital that
        substitute for land.&nbsp; Although capital cannot be converted into
        land, it can substitute for land, and does so when rents and land
        prices
        are high.&nbsp; John Stuart Mill long ago pointed out that the
        structure
        and character of capital is determined by the level of rents and
        wages.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19&nbsp;</span>
        Such substitution is an integral part of the
        equilibrating function of markets; the human race could never have
        attained its present numbers and density without it.&nbsp; High wages
        evoke labor-saving capital; high rents evoke land-saving capital.&nbsp;
        It is useful to carry this farther, and recognize five kinds of
        substitutive capital evoked by high rents and land prices:</small><br>

        <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>a.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-saving

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Tip O'Neil, the former Speaker
        of the US Congress, is oft-quoted that
"All politics is local politics." One might say the same of market
        power. Some lands are sold or leased with covenants against
        competition, as Gimbel's Department Store holds a covenant on a lot
        adjoining its parent store on 3rd Street and Wisconsin Avenue,
        Milwaukee.&nbsp; Such anticompetitive arrangements, however blatant,
        are
        intra-state, and apparently immune from sanctions under US Federal
        anti-trust laws.&nbsp; Scholars of industrial organization, many of
        them
        doing outstanding work otherwise, pay these grass-roots matters little
        heed.&nbsp; Researchers and activists concentrate on commodity markets
        at
        national and world levels -- the ones subject to Federal sanctions,
        such as they are.&nbsp; They could probably find more severe and
        blatant
        market failure in local land markets.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Bargaining power increases with the number of options one
        has.&nbsp; A large
        landowner with a chain of holdings in different jurisdictions is
        positioned to bargain, to play off one against the other.&nbsp; Thus,
        the
        Disney Corporation, 1991-93, considered rebuilding and expanding
        Disneyland at its current site in Anaheim, or in Long Beach where it
        had tenure over another suitable site.&nbsp; Using this leverage it won
        concessions from both cities, "finally" choosing to expand in
        Anaheim.&nbsp;
        It has yet to do so, however, and nothing is really final.&nbsp; Disney
        has
        many other sites around the world.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Likewise, land is a basis for
        oligopsony power in local labor markets. A city's labor pool is often
        faced with a local employers' association whose membership is limited
        by the amount of industrial land within reach of the labor pool.&nbsp;</span>
        Migrant farm labor is faced with statewide employers' associations who
        have the advantages of limited numbers, wealth, ancient roots and
        stability.&nbsp; Labor unions that organize a local plant are faced
        with the
        threat of the "runaway shop", or merely reallocating work among plants,
        when the employer owns plants elsewhere.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Custom has dulled us to it, but a corporation is a pool of
        separate
        individual landowners bargaining in concert.&nbsp; A century ago,
        corporations and limited liability were viewed with suspicion and
        apprehension.&nbsp; Today, hundreds and thousands of separate
        landowners
        pool their corporate strength against labor, as a matter of
        course.&nbsp;
        Some employees bargain through unions, but not as a matter of course,
        and hardly ever with international options.&nbsp; In the US, less than
        20%
        of the labor force is unionized, yet many, probably most economists
        treat labor as the only threatening monopoly.&nbsp; They see
        corporations as
        benign; a prime cause carried by many economists today is to eliminate
        the corporate income tax completely.&nbsp; Would we saw such support
        for
        eliminating the payroll tax, the most obvious cause of unemployment.</small><small><a

        You might say this would be a blessing for the farmers who were
        now more free of these property taxes. </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>However, it didn't work out that way. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The mean acres per farm (the
        average, that is) had remained fairly constant for 65 years
        (1870-1935) at about 155 acres</span>, despite two major industrial
        merger movements, including the steel
        industry. <span style="font-weight: bold;">After 1935 the mean value
        took off and had tripled to 462
        acres by 1987. As the number of farms were falling, national population
        was on the rise.
        In 1900 there was one farm per 11 Americans; in 1987 there was one
        farm per 113 persons.&nbsp;
        </span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        <small>Farms became unaffordable for folks starting at the bottom of

        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Real wage rates, meanwhile
        since 1955, have not risen as fast as
        real land prices, and they haven't risen at all since 1975. </span>This
        has
        raised the labor-price of land (the number of days/years a person must
        work at the average wage

        or what examples you select, you
        will see that every form of enterprise, every step in material
        progress, is only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed
        the cream off for himself. and everywhere today the man or the public
        body that wishes to put land to its highest use is forced to pay a
        preliminary fine in land values to the man who is putting it to an
        in- ferior use, and in some cases to no use at all. All comes back to
        the land value, and its owner for the time being is able to levy his
        toll upon all other forms of wealth and upon every form of
        industry.</small></p>

        some cases the whole --
        of every benefit which is
        laboriously acquired by the community is represented in the land
        value, and finds its way automatically into the landlord's pocket.

        of workmen's trains, or a lowering of fares, or a new invention, or
        any other public convenience affords a benefit to the workers in any
        particular district, it becomes easier for them to live, and
        therefore the landlord and the ground landlord, one on top of the
        other, are able to charge them more for the privilege of living
        there.</small></li>

        was a toll-bar on a bridge across
        the Thames, and all the working people who lived on the south side of
        the river had to pay a daily toll of one penny for going and
        returning from their work. The spectacle of these poor people thus
        mulcted of so large a proportion of their earnings appealed to the
        public conscience; an agitation was set on foot, municipal
        authorities were roused, and at the cost of the ratepayers the bridge
        was freed and the toll removed. All those people who used the bridge
        were saved sixpence a week. Within a very short period from that time
        the
        rents on the south side of the river were found to have advanced by
        aboutsixpence a week, or the amount of the toll which had been
        remitted.

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>VII. Economic Growth</b></small></div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Recognition of the equal rights
        of all to natural opportunities,
        through land value taxation and its extension to charges for the use
        of other resources, is not only just and efficient, but has the
        capacity to make a major contribution to economic growth. This occurs
        through a variety of paths.</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The most important path is that
        public collection of the value of
        exclusive use of natural opportunities provides revenue that makes it
        possible to remove taxes from the earnings of labor and capital. When
        people are taxed less, they earn more. Using data that emerged from
        changes in U.S. tax rates, Feldstein has estimated that the
        elasticity of earnings with respect to the fraction of income not
        taken at the margin by federal taxes is at least 1.0 (and more for
        workers in higher tax
        brackets).<font size="-1"><small><b><i>6</i></b></small></font> When
        the entity that
        removes a tax on labor is less than global, this action also attract
        labor to the region.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When taxes are removed from
        capital, the effect is even more
        powerful, as long as the entity removing the tax is less than global.
        Capital is extremely mobile in response to regional changes in net
        returns. It is highly counterproductive for any locality or nation to
        tax capital, because there will be virtually no effect on the return
        to capital after taxes. Capital will merely be driven from the taxed
        region until the return after taxes matches what can be obtained
        elsewhere. If the whole world removes taxes from capital, the
        resulting increase in the rate of return to capital will increase the
        rate of saving, but the adjustment will occur over some years.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxing land has an additional
        effect that increases the stock of
        capital. A tax on land represents a redistribution from living adults
        to the young and unborn, who will now be born with rights to land.
        Unless there is a perfectly offsetting reduction in the desire to
        accumulate assets to transfer to the next generation, this
        redistribution will induce the living, who now have fewer assets, to
        accumulate at a more rapid rate than they would otherwise do. That
        is, saving and capital accumulation will increase.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxing land also increases the
        efficiency with which land is used.
        This occurs through three paths.</small></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <li><small>First, a tax on land reduces the return to land
        speculation, and therefore reduces the quantity of land speculation. </small></li>
          <li><small>Second, as taxes on land are capitalized into the selling
        price of land, the result is the substitution of a recurring cost (the
        annual tax) for a one-time cost (the purchase price). This makes land
        relatively more attractive to bidders with high discount rates and
        relatively less attractive to bidders with low discount rates. To the
        extent that the former are more entrepreneurial and the latter more
        passive investors, land will tend to flow into the hands of persons who
        will choose to use it more intensively. </small></li>
          <li><small>The third path by which a tax on land increases the
        efficiency with which land is used is that, for those who are using
        land inefficiently, it substitutes an explicit cost (the tax) for an
        implicit one (the income foregone by inefficient use). </small></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Psychologically, explicit costs
        tend to be more effective in
        motivating efficient behavior than implicit ones.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>VIII. An Estimate
        of the Magnitudes of the Consequences of Taxing Land</b></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For all of the above reasons, the
        substitution of tax on land for
        taxes on labor and capital will increase the efficiency of an
        economy. To estimate the magnitudes of these consequences, one needs
        a model of the economy. Consider the following model. There is a
        three-factor CES (constant elasticity of substitution) production
        function:</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Q = (aT&agrave; + bL&agrave; +
        cK&agrave;)(1/&agrave;). (1)</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>where Q is output, T is the
        quantity of land, L is the quantity of
        labor, K is the quantity of capital, a, b and c are coefficients, and
&agrave; is related to the elasticity of substitution, &aring;, by
&agrave; = 1 - 1/&aring;. Land has a completely fixed supply. Labor
        is assumed to have an elasticity of supply of 0.8 (adjusting
        Feldstein's number for the fact that he was considering only federal
        income taxes. Capital is assumed to be supplied perfectly
        elastically. Taking the ratio of compensation of employees to Net
        Domestic Product in National Income and Product Accounts, I assume
        that labor receives two thirds of output. Somewhat arbitrarily, I
        assume that the remaining third is divided equally between land and
        capital. I estimate that the marginal tax rate on labor is 43% (28%
        for the federal income tax, 12% for the combination of state income
        taxes indirect taxes, and 3% for the Medicare tax--I treat social
        security as having benefits equal to its costs, and therefore not a
        tax.) I estimate the marginal tax rate on land and capital at 50%
        (28% for the federal income tax, 12% for the combination of state
        income taxes and indirect taxes, plus 10% for profits taxes). The
        elasticity of substitution is a parameter that I am very unsure of.
        But Feldstein has estimated that the marginal welfare cost of
        taxation is 1.65, and I get that result with a &aring; of 0.68, so I
        assume that &aring; = 0.68.</small></p>

        parameters such as the ones
        named and determines what would happen (in a comparative static

        of the rent of land were taxed. Here are the results:

        Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
        Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <p><small>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes.
        In a
        market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
        four factors of production: </small></p>
        <ul>
          <li><small>the rent of land, </small></li>
          <li><small>the wages of labor, </small></li>
          <li><small>the interest received from owning capital, and </small></li>
          <li><small>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
        investments and organizing production). </small></li>
        </ul>
        <p><small>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy
        must
        either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
        entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
        that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</small></p>
        <p><small>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does
        so at
        the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
        to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
        that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
        reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
        springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
        Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
        attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
        city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
        entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
        that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
        interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
        market forces.</small></p>
        <p><small>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
        earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
        away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
        interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
        have the option of moving away. </small></p>
        <p><small>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the
        rent
        of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
        sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
        opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
        for the costs that their actions impose on others.</small></p>
        <p><small>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for
        revenue
        to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
        entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
        collected publicly without discouraging growth.</small></p>
        <p><small>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
        urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
        rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
        and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are.<strong> ... 
        </strong></small></p>
        <small>... Every activity that is
        continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
        Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
        rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
        pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
        </small>
        <p><small>Thus the rental value of land is a natural first source of
        financing for local public expenditures.</small></p>
        <p><small>Making the rental value of land a principal source of local
        public
        revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
        equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
        on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.
        
</small></p>
        <ul>
          <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of the rental value
        of land is the gift of nature</span>--the fertility
        of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
        of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
        be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
        than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
        it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
        spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</small></li>
          <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second part of the
        rental value of land comes from the provision
        of public services.</span> The local agencies that provide these
        services
        can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
        results from their activities.</small></li>
          <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A third part of the
        rental value of any particular site arises
        from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
        site. </span>Social collection of this part of the rental value of
        land is
        particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
        private activities according to how much they increase the rental
        value of land.</small></li>
        </ul>
        <p><small>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of
        land
        has two parts. </small></p>
        <ul>
          <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> First, the rental value
        of land has the rare quality of being a source of public revenue that
        does not discourage productive activity. </span>If people are taxed
        according to their labor earnings, they can be expected to work less,
        and to tend to move from the places that tax them. If people are taxed
        on their investments and savings, they can be expected to save and
        invest less, and to find it attractive to put their savings and
        investments in other places where they will not be taxed as much. But
        when the rental value of land is collected, no one will reduce the
        amount of land in existence, and no one will move his land elsewhere.
        Thus social collection of the rent of land does not reduce the
        productivity of an economy in the way that most other sources of public
        revenue do.</small></li>
          <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second part of the
        efficiency argument is that social collection of the rent of land tends
        to make land more available to those who want to start new enterprises</span>.
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
        not collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to
        ignore the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better
        use of it. </span>On the other hand, if those who have rights to land
        are required to make annual payments equal to the market value of the
        rights they hold, then these continuing payments will induce people to
        ask themselves regularly whether they ought to release the land to
        someone who can make better use of it.</small></li>
        </ul>
        <p><small>To achieve the potential efficiency of public revenue from
        land,
        it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
        just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
        The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
        that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
        should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
        can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
        their neighbors are being charged.</small></p>
        <p><small>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
        privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
        according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
        it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
        passing out titles to the current users of land. </small></p>
        <p><small>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
        generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
        And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
        land.</small></p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>The
        efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
        finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
        revenue as well:</small></p>
        <blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
        as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
        radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
          <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
        payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
        revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
          <small> </small>
          <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
        pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
        estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
        on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
        cost.</small></p>
          <small> </small>
          <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
        value of surrounding land.</small></p>
          <small> </small>
          <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
        crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
        others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
        is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
        handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
        that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
          <small> </small>
          <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
        which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
          <small> </small>
          <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
        electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
        make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
        is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
        he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
        increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
        covered by user charges.</small></p>
          <small> </small>
          <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
        at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
        tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
        to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
        pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
        may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
        it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
        identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
        purposes.</small></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
        of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
        collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
        excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
        basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
        finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
        additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
        all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
        paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
        tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
        disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
        most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
        <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
        the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
        moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
        of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
        corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
        higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
        higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
        complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
        to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
        partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
        provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
        receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
        for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
        investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
        a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
        change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
        all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
        corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
        either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
        be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
        Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
        attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
        government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
        collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
        <p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
        features. 
        </small></p>
        <ul>
          <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
        that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
        competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
        of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
        this feature. 
            </small></li>
          <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
        is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
        person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
        pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
        surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
        other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
        publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
        reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
        development. 
            </small></li>
        </ul>
        <small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
        attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
        raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
        its land.</small> <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

        A surfeit of jobs, the consequence of recovering rents, goes nicely
        with the flagship goal of a life of leisure, the consequence of sharing
        rents. Further, when jobs seek people instead of vice versa, not only
        can workers hold out for higher wages &#8211; as in the tech industries in
        the 1990s &#8211; but they also gain the leverage to metamorphose

        labor leverage to negotiate not just higher wages, but also co-manage,

        Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
        stay rich, some of us can develop
        land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
        especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
        they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
        city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
        than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
        resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
        not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
        -- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
        designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
        our civilization, and our
        eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
        decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
        our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
        to the
        public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
        that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
        and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
        and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
        favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and
        automobile.<strong>... </strong></small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the
        public, governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
        values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
        economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
        stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Going
        beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
        pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
        Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
        benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
        playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
        taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as

        <small>Collecting rent for
        government-granted privileges would not only raise trillions but also
        whittle corporations down to a competitive size, less hazardous to
        democracy. </small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides charging what privileges
        are worth, government should also
        replace license with responsibility ("internalize the
        externalities"). To temper the temptation to use lands both fragile
        and valuable, society could impose surcharges - an Ecology Security
        Deposit, Restoration Insurance, Emission Permits, and fines when
        users exceed standards. To minimize all these charges, producers
        would seek sustainable alternatives. Getting and sharing rent from
        land titles is the centerpiece of this geonomic revenue reform. Each
        phase of such a revenue shift motivates sustainable choices in its
        own way. </small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><b>1. Get the rent. </b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Having
        to pay over rent to community makes speculation not worth the bother.</span>
        So owners use their land and resources more efficiently. Using some
        land more intensely means using other land not at all. Plus, intense
        use augments the housing stock, lowering the housing cost. Pittsburgh,
        while taxing land six times more than buildings, enjoyed the most
        affordable housing of any major US city. More residents are owner
        occupants who choose to improve their homes, plugging heat leaks, etc. </small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><b>2. De-tax wages and
        interest.</b> Removing such taxes while collecting rent moves
        investment funds in the opposite direction, from extraction and
        speculation into advancing physical capital and hyper-training labor.
        The resultant investment shift would accelerate techno-progress,
        helping us get more from less. </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><b>3. De-subsidize
        favored producers.</b> Besides giving lobbyists a reason to contemplate
        a career change, abolishing subsidies would force producers to cut
        waste, to call on all the tools and techniques extolled by Amory Lovins
        and other green industrialists. </small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><b>4. Pay out the rent.</b>
        Getting money for nothing, would people still pursue mindless
        consumption of goodies or switch to mindful consumption of leisure? The
        pressure to consume stuff for prestige should be lessened by the
        increased equality in society. <span

        equal to

        <p>Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Geoist_Crusoe.html">A
        Geoist Robinson Crusoe Story
        </a></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, Robinson G.
        Crusoe was the only survivor of a ship
        that sunk. He floated on a piece of wood to an unpopulated island.
        Robinson was an absolute geoist. He believed with his mind, heart, and
        soul that everyone should have an equal share of land rent.</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since he was the only person on
        this island, it was all his. He
        surveyed the island and found that the only crop available for
        cultivation was alfalfa sprouts. The land was divided into 5 grades
        that could grow 8, 6, 4, 2, and zero bushels of alfalfa sprouts per
        month. There was one acre each for 8, 6, and 4, and 100 acres of
        2-bushel land. For 8 hours per day of labor, he could work 4 acres. So
        he could grow, per month, 8+6+4+2 = 20 bushels of alfalfa sprouts, much
        more than enough to feed on.<br>
        <br>
        One day another survivor of a sunken ship floated to the island. His
        name was Friday George. Friday was a boring talker and kept chattering
        about trivialities, which greatly irritated Robinson. "I possess the
        whole island. You may only have this rocky area," said Robinson. ...</small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Robinson realized that it did
        not matter which lands he possessed. He
        could possess better land, but so long as the rent is split equally, if
        the wage rate is equal, their income will not be affected. Lawyers say
        that possession is nine tenths of the law, but the law of rent says,
        possession does not matter.</small><br>
        <small>
        </small><br>
        <small>
        If the rent is split equally, those who possess land and want to
        maximize their income will possess only that amount that maximizes
        income for all. If they possess too much land, they would drive wages
        down and rents up, leaving less for the possessors. So it does not
        matter who owns what land, if the rent is equally split. ... <a

        Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Underprivileged
        or Rights-Deprived?</a><br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Poor folk are often labeled
"underprivileged" and richer folk are called "privileged." For example,
        there is a book titled "<span style="font-style: italic;">One Nation,
        Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All</span>."
        But "privileged" and "underprivileged" are confused and misleading
        expressions. If you think the poor are "underprivileged," then you
        don't really understand poverty.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>
        What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law." A
        privilege is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit
        given only to some people only because they have power or are favored
        by those with power. If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom
        of expression, or if everyone may obtain an item such as a passport
        with the same rules applying to all, then it is not a privilege but a
        right.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>
        Whether a rich person is "privileged" depends on how he got the
        money.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>
        So if a person is poor, it is not because he is lacking in special
        protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually poor
        because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
        world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources,
        keeping some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived
        of their earnings from labor.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>
        Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to employers
        and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less
        employment. Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of
        goods has the same effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability
        taxes, and payroll taxes that increase the tax wedge. On top of that,
        there are minimum-wage laws that prevent the least productive workers
        from getting hired. There are permits, zoning, and other rules and
        costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>
        Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and labor,
        and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have
        little or no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance.
        To call them "underprivileged" is a lie. The rights-deprived poor do
        not need privileges. They just need government to stop interfering with
        their right to work and save!</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers
        and those
        who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay
        extra to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed.
        These people lack privileges which others have. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The proper remedy is
        not to expand privileges, but to eliminate all governmental privileges.
        That is why libertarians and geoists alike have the motto: "Equal
        rights for all; privileges for none!"</span></small><br>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Picture an unpopulated island
        where we're going to produce one
        good, corn, and there are eleven grades of land. On the best land, we
        can grow ten bushels of corn per week; the second land grows nine
        bushels, and so on to the worst land that grows zero bushels. We'll
        ignore capital goods at first. The first settlers go the best land.
        While there is free ten-bushel land, rent is zero, so wages are 10.
        When the 10-bushel land is all settled, immigrants go to the 9-bushel
        land. </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Wages in the 9-bushel land equal
        9 while free land is available.
        What then are wages in the 10-bushel land? They must also be 9, since
        labor is mobile. If you offer less, nobody will come, and if you
        offer a bit more than 9, everybody in the 9-bushel land will want to
        work for you. Competition among workers makes wages the same all over
        (we assume all workers are alike). So that extra bushel in the
        10-bushel land, after paying 9 for labor, is rent. </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That border line where the best
        free land is being settled is
        called the "margin of production." When the margin moves to the
        8-bushel land, wages drop to 8. Rent is now 1 on the 9-bushel land and
        2 on the 10-bushel land. Do you see what the trend is? As the margin
        moves to less productive lands, wages are going down and rent is
        going up. We can also now see that wages are determined at the margin
        of production. That is the "law of wages." The wage at the margin
        sets the wage for all lands. The production in the better lands left
        after paying wages goes to rent. That is the "law of rent." If you
        understand the law of wages and the law of rent, you see the cat! To
        complete our cat story, suppose folks can get land to rent and sell
        for higher prices later rather than using it now. This land
        speculation will hog up lands and make the margin move further out
        than without speculation, lowering wages and raising rent even more.
        </small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now we have good news and bad
        news. The good news is that when we
        put in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">capital goods</span>
        we first left out from the example above,
        the tools and technology increase the productivity of all the lands.
        If production doubles, rent doubles, and wages go up. Wages won't
        double, because workers have to pay for the tools, but even if wages
        go up 50 percent, that's good news, and why industrialized economies
        have a high standard of living. Also, high skills enable educated
        workers to have a wage premium above the basic wage level. <strong>The bad
        news is that the technology enables us to extend the margin to less
        productive land, which lowers wages again. So there is this constant
        race between technology raising wages and lower margins reducing
        wages. </strong></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It's bad enough that a low margin
        sets the wage level at the
        poverty level, especially in countries with low technology and low
        skills. Government then taxes away a large chunk of those wages,
        which hurts those workers with higher wages. The result is a highly
        unequal distribution of income. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Workers have the low wage set at
        the
        margin and reduced further by taxes, while the owners of land get all
        the extra production as rent, but pay less in taxes because of tax
        breaks to landowners.</span> (Capital-goods returns boil down to wages
        and
        rents, because capital goods are ultimately produced using land and
        labor.) </small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Behold the cat! The margin at
        the least productive land sets low
        wages, and the rest goes to rent, resulting in inequality, with
        poverty for low-skilled workers.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> If we
        see the cat, the remedy is
        also clear: stop taxing workers, and let everybody share the rent.</span>

        The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
        (Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a>
        (1881)&nbsp;<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Land Values intended by
        Providence for Public Purposes.</b></small>
        <br>
        <small>I have already observed that the chief peculiarity of the land
        of
        a country was that its value was never stationary, that it was always
        progressive and rising, that in fact it increased in a direct ratio
        with the growth of the population and the advancing progress of the
        industry of the nation.</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would seem as if Providence had
        destined the land to serve as a
        large economical reservoir, to catch, to collect and preserve the
        overflowing streams of wealth that are constantly escaping from the
        great public industrial works that are always going on in communities
        that are progressive and prosperous.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides the permanent improvements
        that are made in the land
        itself, and which increase its productiveness and value, there are
        other industrial works not carried out on the land itself, but on its
        surroundings and in its vicinity, and which enhance its value very
        considerably. A new road is made for the accommodation of a district;
        a new bridge is thrown across a river or a stream to make two
        important localities accessible to each other; a new railway passes
        close by and connects it with certain large and important centres of
        industry; a new factory or a new mill is erected, or a new town is
        built in the neighbourhood.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Industrial works like these add
        very materially to the value of
        all the land in their vicinity. It is a well-known fact that a new
        railway has in several instances doubled the value of the land
        through which it passed, in consequence of the increased facilities
        it had afforded for the sale of its agricultural products.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In every state of society, which
        is progressive and improving,
        such industrial works are continually going on, and hence the value
        of the land is rising also everywhere. But its value rises enormously
        with the enlarged growth of the population of a nation, and with the
        increased productiveness of its industry. </small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Wages Do Not Keep Pace.</b></small>
        <br>
        <small>The United Kingdom furnishes an example that is singularly
        illustrative of this fact. Says Mr. Cairnes: <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">"A given exertion of
        British labour and capital will now produce in a great many
        directions five, ten or twenty times, in some instances perhaps a
        hundred times the result which an equal exertion would have produced
        a hundred years ago.</span> It is not probable that industry is, in any
        direction whatever, less productive now than it was then; <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">yet the
        rate of wages, as measured by the real well-being of the labourer,
        has certainly not advanced in anything like a corresponding degree;
        while it may be doubted if the rate of profit has advanced at all</span>."
        A
        given amount, then, of British capital and labour is now ten or
        twenty times more effective than a hundred years ago, while, on the
        other hand, the quantity of such effective labour and capital now
        engaged in British industrial production is perhaps twenty times
        larger now than formerly.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landlords Sow Not, But They
        Reap. .... 
        </b></small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Great National Property
        Which Landlords Are Permitted to
        Appropriate. ...</b></small><br>
        <small>... Those who hold the ownership of the land hold also the
        ownership
        of all the accessions of value it receives from all quarters. This
        increase in the value of their property cost no sacrifice, demanded
        no painful effort of labour. Even while they slept their rent rolls
        went on increasing and multiplying.</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The value continually imparted to
        the land by the industrial
        exertions of the community, in the construction of harbours and
        bridges, in the making of new roads and railways, in the erection of
        new factories, mills and houses, etc., has all gone with the land,
        has all been confiscated and appropriated by the owners of the
        soil.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Cairnes feels sorely
        perplexed to account for some of
        the anomalous results of this appropriation. He says: "A bale of
        cloth, a machine, a house, owes its value to the labour expended upon
        it, and belongs to the person who expends or employs the labour; a
        piece of land owes its value, so far as its value is affected by the
        causes I am now considering, not to the labour expended on the land,
        but that expended on something else -- the labour expended in making
        a railroad or in building houses in an adjoining town; and the value
        thus added to the land belongs not to the persons who have made the
        railroads or built the houses, but to someone who may not have been
        aware that these operations were being carried on -- nay, who perhaps
        has exerted all his efforts to prevent their being carried on. How
        many landlords have their rent rolls doubled by railways made in
        their despite!"</small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Professor's Unwitting
        Testimony</b></small>
        <br>
        <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It never occurred to
        Mr. Cairnes that he had here given, quite
        unconsciously to himself, an unanswerable argument, </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">ex absurdo</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">, to
        prove the injustice of the appropriation of the land.</span> If the
        land had
        not been confiscated no such absurd or unjust result could have
        followed. The value imparted by labour to the land, exactly like "the
        bale of cloth, the house or the machine," would belong to the persons
        who expended or employed that labour, that is to say, to the public,
        by whose industrial exertions it had been created.</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Lastly, the vast accessions of
        value which the land is constantly
        receiving from the proceeds of that "self-imposed tax" which the
        nation levies on itself in the high prices it pays for the "raw
        products of the soil," together with the increased productiveness of
        the soil itself, go all, as Mr. Cairnes is forced to confess,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
"neither to profits nor to wages nor to the public at large, but to
        swell a fund ever growing, even while its proprietors sleep -- to the
        rent roll of the owner of the soil."</span>&nbsp;
        </small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Private Property in
        Land
        the Real Robber of Labour.</b></small></div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus the appropriation of God's
        gifts in the land led naturally,
        and as a matter of course, to the appropriation of an enormous amount
        of the wages and earnings of the nation, which, in the designs of
        Providence, kept constantly dropping into the land, accumulating on
        the land, and adding to the value of the land, not for the enrichment
        of the landlords, but for the support of the public burdens of the
        State.</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Now a system of Land Tenure which
        thus despoils the people of a
        nation of a vast amount of their earnings, which transfers a valuable
        property which they have created by patient, painful and selfdenying
        efforts of their labour, to a class who do not labour at all, and
        make no sacrifices whatever, can, I think, be fairly characterised as
        a system of national spoliation. </span>The hardworking, industrious
        masses
        of the nation are taxed twice, and for an enormous amount each time.
        <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">They are
        taxed first for the benefit of the owners of the soil, to
        supply them with all the comforts, enjoyments and luxuries which they
        desire, and are taxed again to the amount of eighty millions annually
        for the government and defence of the country.</span></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With two such enormous drains on
        the productive industry and
        labour of the country, I cannot share in the astonishment which Mr.
        Cairnes feels at finding that, notwithstanding the increased
        productiveness of British industry, "the rate of wages, as measured
        by the real well-being of the labourer," has not improved to any
        material extent, "while it may be doubted whether the rate of profit
        has advanced at all."</small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Both Capital and Labour are
        Exploited.</b></small>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Both capitalists and
        operatives, therefore, are intensely
        disappointed and supremely dissatisfied with these disheartening
        results, and mutually reproach each other with fraud and foul dealing
        in the division of their common earnings. </span>Their mutual
        misunderstandings and rival claims to a larger share than they
        actually receive have given rise to "lockouts" on the one side and
"strikes" on the other; to combinations of capitalists among the
        employers and "Trade Unions" among the labourers. Thus their mutual
        relations, which ought to be of the friendliest character, have at
        last settled down into the permanent form of an insane internecine
        war, which inflicts irreparable injury on the common interests of
        both.</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
        never occurs to either side that a third party could possibly
        be liable to blame.</span> I think I have shown that neither party has
        received, or at all events can retain for his own use and enjoyment,
        its fair share of their common earnings. The existing system of Land
        Tenure, like a great national thief, robs both parties of an enormous
        amount of their earnings for the benefit of a class who do not labour
        at all.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As the operatives complain the
        louder, so the case they make
        against the capitalists seem really the weaker and the worse founded
        of the two. Mr. Cairnes, with many others, proved to evidence that
        unless in rare and exceptional cases it is perfectly impossible for
        the capitalist to withhold from the operatives their fair share in
        their common earnings.</small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Higher Money Wages but Lower
        Purchasing Power.</b></small>
        <br>
        <small>Does it therefore follow that the strong, widespread and
        permanent
        feeling of discontent which prevail among the labourers is the result
        of fancy or imagination, having no solid foundation whatever in
        fact?</small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Undoubtedly this feeling proves
        the labourers to have substantial
        grievances, although I think they have failed to trace them to the
        causes that have really produced them. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
        money wage of the English
        operative is now considerably higher than in any past period of
        English history. But if his money wage is now high, the price of the
        raw products of the soil, that is to say, of the necessaries and
        comforts of life, is vastly higher still.</span></small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A given amount of money will not
        now procure for him the same
        quantity of food and of the other necessaries of life as formerly. In
        purchasing the raw products of the soil, he must pay not only for the
        necessaries and comforts of life which he enjoys himself, but also
        for the comforts and luxuries which go to the enjoyment of the owners
        of the soil. The price, therefore, of the raw products is a payment
        and a tax; a payment for what he consumes himself, and a tax for what
        is consumed by others.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then again, a vast margin of the
        earnings of the English people is
        expended in direct and indirect taxation. The public burdens of every
        nation fall mainly on the vast masses of that nation, and the
        operatives of England are the vast masses of the English nation.</small></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the English operatives could
        only retain for their own use and
        benefit the vast sums which, under the existing system of Land
        Tenure, go on the one hand to the owners of the soil, and the sums
        that an economical system of taxation would save for them on the
        other, their material comforts and enjoyments would be multiplied a
        hundred fold. Under the existing state of things their condition is
        utterly incapable of any improvement in the future.&nbsp; <a

        myself.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
        <small>
        Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes me. I reflect that there is no
        unoccupied land in the neighbourhood, so that if my laborers were
        free they would still have to look to me for work somehow.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
        <small>
        Most of them think they would like to have a piece of land and
        work it for themselves, and be their own masters.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
        <small> "But," softly I observe, "you are going too fast. Your
        proposals
        about the tools and seed and your maintenance are all right enough,
        but the land, you remember, belongs to me. You cannot expect me to
        give you your liberty and my own land for nothing. That would not be
        reasonable, would it?"&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
        <small>
        Still I am ready to do what I promised &#8212; "to employ as many
        as I may require, on such terms as we may mutually and independently
        agree."&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
        <small>
        So they all set to at the old work at the old place, and on the
        old terms, only a little differently administered; that is, that
        whereas I formerly supplied them with food, clothes, etc., direct
        from my stores, I now give them a weekly wage representing the value
        of those articles, which they will henceforth have to buy for
        themselves.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>

        advantage, and their children compelled to attend these schools. The
        service I get, too, being now voluntarily rendered (or apparently so)
        is much improved in quality. In short, the arrangement pays me better

        the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
        character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
        benevolence. I am a "large employer of labour," to whom the whole
        country, and the labourer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
        say, "See the power of capital! These poor labourers, having no
        capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
        far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
        for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
        them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
        country, and his own fortune together."</small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
        Whereas it is not my capital that does any of these things.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
        <small>
        But now another thought strikes me. Instead of paying an overseer
        to work these men for me, I will make him pay me for the privilege of
        doing it. I will let the land as it stands to him or to another
&#8212; to whomsoever will give the most for the billet. He shall be
        called my tenant instead of my overseer, but the things he shall do
        for me are essentially the same, only done by contract instead of for
        yearly pay.&nbsp;<strong> .... </strong></small><strong><br>
        </strong><small><br>
        For a moderate reduction in my profits, then &#8212; a reduction
        equal to the tenant's narrow margin of profit &#8212; I have all the
        toil and worry of management taken off my hands, and the risk too,
        for be the season good or bad, the rent is bound to be forthcoming,
        and I can sell him up to the last rag if he fails of the full amount,
        no matter for what reason; and my rent takes precedence of all other
        debts.<strong> ... </strong></small><strong>
        </strong>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If wages are forced down it is not
        I that do it; it is that greedy
        and merciless man the employer (my tenant) who does it. I am a lofty
        and superior being, dwelling apart and above such sordid
        considerations. I would never dream of grinding these poor labourers,
        not I! I have nothing to do with them at all; <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">I only want my rent --
        and
        get it. </span><b>Like the lillies of the field, I toil not, neither
        do I
        spin, and yet (so kind is Providence!) my daily bread (well buttered)
        comes to me of itself. </b>Nay, people bid against each other for the
        privilege of finding it for me; and no one seems to realise that the
        comfortable income that falls to me like the refreshing dew is dew
        indeed; but it is the dew of sweat wrung from the labourers' toil. It
        is the fruit of their labour which they ought to have; which they
        would have if I did not take it from them.</small></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
        This sketch illustrates the fact that chattel slavery is not the
        only nor even the worst form of bondage. When the use of the earth
&#8212; the sole source of our daily bread &#8212; is denied unless one
        pays a fellow creature for permission to use it, people are bereft of
        economic freedom. The only way to regain that freedom is to collect
        the rent of land instead of taxes for the public domain.
        </small></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, labour leaders
        in the USA, the UK and Australia
        understood these facts. The labour movements of those countries were
        filled with people who fought for the principles of 'the single tax'
        on land at the turn of the twentieth century. But since then, it has
        been ridiculed, and they have gradually yielded to the forces of
        privilege and power &#8212; captives of the current hegemony &#8212;
        daring no longer to come to grips with this fundamental question,
        lest they, too, become ridiculed.</small></p>

        Henry George: <a href="../HG/how_to_help_the_unemployed.html">How
        to Help the Unemployed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1894)<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Yet why is it that men able
        to work and willing to work cannot
        find work?&nbsp; ..</small><br>
        <br>
        <small> For the question of the unemployed is
        but a more than usually acute phase of the great labor question -- a
        question of the distribution of wealth. Now, given any wrong, no
        matter what, that affects the distribution of wealth, and it follows
        that the leading class must be averse to any examination or question
        of it. For, since wealth is power, the leading class is necessarily
        dominated by those who profit or imagine they profit by injustice in
        the distribution of wealth. Hence, the very indisposition to ask the
        cause of evils so great as to arouse and startle the whole community
        is but proof that they spring from some wide and deep injustice. ... </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>... So that, whether we begin at the right or the
        wrong end, any analysis brings us at last to the conclusion that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the
        opportunities of finding employment and the rate of all wages depend
        ultimately upon the freedom of access to land; the price that labor
        must pay for its use....</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
        <br>
        <small>... Today, as the last census reports show, the majority of
        American
        farmers are rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the first form
        of tenancy; and the great majority of our people are landless men,
        without right to employ their own labor and without stake in the land
        they still foolishly speak of as their country. This is the reason why
        the army of the unemployed has appeared among us, why by pauperism has
        already become chronic, and why in the tramp we have in more dangerous
        type the proletarian of ancient Rome.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>These recurring spasms of business stagnation; these long-drawn
        periods
        of industrial depression, common to the civilized world, do not come
        from our treatment of money; are not caused and are not to be cured by
        changes of tariffs. Protection is a robbery of labor, and what is
        called free trade would give some temporary relief, but speculation in
        land would only set in the stronger, and at last labor and capital
        would again resist, by partial cessation, the blackmail demanded for
        their employment in production, and the same round would be run again. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">There
        is but one remedy, and that is what is now known as the single-tax --
        the abolition of all taxes upon labor and capital, and of all taxes
        upon their processes and products, and the taking of economic rent, the
        unearned increment which now goes to the mere appropriator, for the
        payment of public expenses. </span>Charity can merely demoralize and
        pauperize, while that indirect form of charity, the attempt to
        artificially "make work" by increasing public expenses and by charity
        woodyards and sewing-rooms, is still more dangerous. If, in this sense,
        work is to be made, it can be made more quickly by dynamite and
        kerosene.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>But there is no need for charity; no need for "making work." All
        that
        is needed is to remove the restrictions that prevent the natural demand
        for the products of work from availing itself of the natural supply.
        Remove them today, and every unemployed man in the country could find
        for himself employment tomorrow, and his "effective demand" for the
        things he desires would infuse new life into every subdivision of
        business and industry, even that of the dentist, the preacher, the
        magazine writer, or the actor.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>The country is suffering from "scarcity of employment." But let
        anyone
        to-day attempt to employ his own labor or that of others, whether in
        making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, or in erecting a
        factory, and he will at once meet the speculator to demand of him an
        unnatural price for the land he must use, and the tax-gatherer to fine
        him for his act in employing labor as if he had committed a crime. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The
        common-sense way to cure "scarcity of employment" is to take taxes off
        the products and processes of employment and to impose in their stead
        the tax that would end speculation in land.</span></small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But, it will be said, this is
        not
        quick enough. On the contrary, it is quicker than anything else. Even
        the public recognition of its need, by but a part of the intelligence
        and influence that is now devoted to charity appeals and schemes, would
        have such an effect upon the speculative price of land as to at once
        set labor and capital to work. </span><span

        being a low ceiling on Georgist
        taxation applied locally. Henry <span style="font-weight: bold;">George
        recognized that the power
        elite of landowner/employers use Malthus' doctrine to oppose raising
        wages</span> -- it would just spawn an invasion of new brats into the
        work
        force, they said, bringing wage rates back down to bare subsistence. To
        make his points, George had to refute Malthus. George's view
        mostly prevailed, with exceptions, until fairly recent times.
        Neo-classical economists even hijacked it, with a reverse spin, to
        trivialize land values. Whatever we may think of Malthus today,
        there is no doubt that the fear of population increments from outside
        the taxing polity now plays the role that George ascribed to
        Malthusianism, and plays it with devastating effect.<strong> ...

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Public spending should feature
"Citizen Dividends." These are
        social dividends limited to citizens, thus discouraging free or
        illegal immigration that would dilute the dividends and erode their
        voter support. (The degree, pace, and conditions of legal
        immigration is an issue to treat separately.) Dividends take many
        forms other than outright per head cash grants. The G.I. Bill was a
        splendid example. Social Security payments are another. School
        equalization payments based on a.d.a. are another. A state or
        province cannot easily restrict benefits to its old time citizens, as
        Zobel showed -- but a nation can.

        </div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist policy removes the many
        big tax wedges between worker and
        employer, and employer and customer, and worker and consumable goods.
        Thus labor can cost the employer less, while the worker gets more
        disposable income after-tax. Many economists inveigh against the
        minimum wage, claiming it overprices labor. It is a matter of
        suspicion that they are then silent on the deadly effects of the
        payroll tax, which affects workers at all levels. Sales taxes, too,
        cut into real wages, yet many of these same economists would raise
        sales taxes and introduce VAT. President and Mrs. Clinton now speak
        seriously of raising payroll taxes even more, to finance the new
        health plan.</small></div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a high elasticity of
        demand for labor. This may be
        observed in farming, for example, where landowners have avoided union
        wage rates simply by shifting their land from fresh fruits and
        vegetables to labor-sparing uses like small grains or cotton.
        Conversely, removing the payroll tax burden will move owners to shift
        land back into labor-using enterprises.<span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a

        Wage</a><br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a proposal in San Francisco,
            California, to establish a minimum wage of $11 per hour for companies that
            provide services or lease land from the city. Those who favor this argue
            that the high cost of living in San Francisco warrants requiring this wage
            floor so that those workers can afford housing and other living expenses.
            ... </small><br>
          <br>
          <small><a href="../docs/Churchill_TPL.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If many workers in the city were to receive a net
        increase in wages, this extra money would be a pot of gold for their landlords.</span></a> </small></div>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <li><small>Those landlords not under rent control would be able to raise the
              rents of their low-income tenants, since if the tenant could afford to
              live there before the raise, he can also afford it if the higher rent brings
          him back to the same after-rent income. </small></li>
          <li><small>Those tenants in rent-controlled apartments would get a double subsidy,
              rent and wages, increasing the inequality between those with privileges
          and those who were not lucky enough to get the government grants.</small></li>
        </ul>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">So the effect of local "living wage" laws
              are generally higher taxes, higher rents and fewer services for the residents,
              greater inequality, and not that much improvement in the well-being of
              the poorest workers and of the city community.</span> The superficial appeal
              of this programs that only treats the effects of poverty dissolves when
              subjected to economic analysis.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The fundamental reason why the least-able workers have low wages is
          that their labor has a low productivity and that a large chunk of their wage
          is taken away by taxes. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The best remedy is to deal with the root cause of
          the problem: change the school system to raise the educational level of the
          students, and stop taxing wages when earned or spent. Shift the tax base from
          wages to land rent.</span> These reforms would raise the pure market wages
          of the least able workers. Then employers would willingly pay the higher wages
          because the workers are worth it.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Living_Wage.html">Read
