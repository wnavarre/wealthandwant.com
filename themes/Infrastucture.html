Or does it make sense to pay for infrastructure by taxing land value? This website
        argues that the legitimate way to pay for infrastructure spending is
        by taxing land value. If we tax land value fully, and that still isn't
        enough to pay for all the infrastructure we feel it appropriate to build
        and maintain, then, yes, it may be desirable to supplement taxes on land

  <p>Think, too, about the effects of building infrastructure in other countries.
    Who benefits? All the residents? Mostly those who own their own homes and

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  <p>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</p>
  <p>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
    of what some have to sell and others must buy.</p>
  <p>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
    it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</p>
  <p>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
    sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
    and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to
    do.</p>
  <p>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
    thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest
    division of wealth.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
    of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
    octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
    duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
    on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
    the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
    be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
    need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
    deem a right one?</p>
  <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
    the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
    scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
    price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
    they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
    thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
    others.</p>
  <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
    of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
  <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
    are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
    that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
    the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
    effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
    buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
    gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
    of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
    sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
    it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
    of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
    instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
    of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
  <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
    show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
    intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
  <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
    a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
    the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
    of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
    in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
    of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
    reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
    always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
    user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
    pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
    the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
    or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
    to be a user.</p>
  <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
    of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
    what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
    to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
    community as a whole.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
        are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
        what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
        from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
        for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
        be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
        in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
        will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
        as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
        determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
        the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
        increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
        cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
        or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
        in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
        recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
        cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
        Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
          by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
          and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
          can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
      2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
      particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
      by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
      for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
      3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
      in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
      social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
      withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
        be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
        the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
        land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
        because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
        economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
        were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
        since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
        of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
        receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
        demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
        to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
        were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
        for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
        merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
    of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
    to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
    impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
    it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
    by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
    artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
    that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
    most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
    enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
    temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
    innocent.</p>
  <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
    needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
    of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
    nourishment of the babe.</p>
  <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
    the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
    but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
    But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
    necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
    begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
    more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
    time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
    The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
    since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
    steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
    centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
    Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
    of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
    due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
    cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
    streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
    health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
    of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
    the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
    improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
    law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
    anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
    values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
  <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
    and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
    If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
    with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
    the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
    us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
    that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
  <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one thing
    that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue of which
    all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general improvements
    of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the
    dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
    Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
    is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it
    not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
    while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with the
    advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each member
    of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from
    his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen
    relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
    the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
    the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
    should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater
    equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
    an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>But worse perhaps than all else is the way in which this substituting of
    vague injunctions to charity for the clear-cut demands of justice opens an
    easy means for the professed teachers of the Christian religion of all branches
    and communions to placate Mammon while persuading themselves that they are
    serving God. Had the English clergy not subordinated the teaching of justice
    to the teaching of charity &#8212; to go no further in illustrating a principle
    of which the whole history of Christendom from Constantine&#8217;s time to
    our own is witness &#8212; the Tudor tyranny would never have arisen, and
    the separation of the church been averted; had the clergy of France never
    substituted charity for justice, the monstrous iniquities of the ancient
    r&eacute;gime would never have brought the horrors of the Great Revolution;
    and in my own country had those who should have preached justice not satisfied
    themselves with preaching kindness, chattel slavery could never have demanded
    the holocaust of our civil war.</p>
  <p>No, your Holiness; as faith without works is dead, as men cannot give to
    God his due while denying to their fellows the rights be gave them, so charity
    unsupported by justice can do nothing to solve the problem of the existing
    condition of labor. Though the rich were to &#8220;bestow all their goods
    to feed the poor and give their bodies to be burned,&#8221; poverty would
    continue while property in land continues.</p>
  <p>Take the case of the rich man today who is honestly desirous of devoting
    his wealth to the improvement of the condition of labor. What can he do?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bestow his wealth on those who need it? He may help some who deserve
      it, but will not improve general conditions. And against the good he may
      do will be the danger of doing harm.</li>
    <li> Build churches? Under the shadow of churches poverty festers and the
      vice that is born of it breeds.</li>
    <li> Build schools and colleges? Save as it may lead men to see the iniquity
      of private property in land, increased education can effect nothing for
      mere laborers, for as education is diffused the wages of education sink.</li>
    <li> Establish hospitals? Why, already it seems to laborers that there are
      too many seeking work, and to save and prolong life is to add to the pressure.</li>
    <li> Build model tenements? Unless he cheapens house accommodations he but

      he brings more to seek employment and cheapens wages.</li>
    <li> Institute laboratories, scientific schools, workshops for physical experiments?
      He but stimulates invention and discovery, the very forces that, acting
      on a society based on private property in land, are crushing labor as between
      the upper and the nether millstone.</li>
    <li> Promote emigration from places where wages are low to places where they
      are somewhat higher? If he does, even those whom he at first helps to emigrate
      will soon turn on him to demand that such emigration shall be stopped as
      reducing their wages.</li>
    <li> Give away what land he may have, or refuse to take rent for it, or let
      it at lower rents than the market price? He will simply make new landowners
      or partial landowners; he may make some individuals the richer, but he
      will do nothing to improve the general condition of labor.</li>
    <li> <strong>Or, bethinking himself of those public-spirited citizens of
        classic times who spent great sums in improving their native cities,
        shall he try
      to beautify the city of his birth or adoption? Let him widen and straighten
      narrow and crooked streets, let him build parks and erect fountains, let
      him open tramways and bring in railroads, or in any way make beautiful
      and attractive his chosen city, and what will be the result? Must it not
      be that those who appropriate God&#8217;s bounty will take his also? Will
      it not be that the value of land will go up, and that the net result of
      his benefactions will be an increase of rents and a bounty to landowners?
      Why, even the mere announcement that he is going to do such things will
      start speculation and send up the value of land by leaps and bounds.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>What, then, can the rich man do to improve the condition of labor?</p>
  <p>He can do nothing at all except to use his strength for the abolition of
    the great primary wrong that robs men of their birthright. The justice of
    God laughs at the attempts of men to substitute anything else for it. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[08] In the rude beginning, each family produces its own food, makes its
    own clothes, builds its own house, and, when it moves, furnishes its own
    transportation. Compare with this independence the intricate interdependence
    of the denizens of a modern city. They may supply themselves with greater
    certainty, and in much greater variety and abundance, than the savage; but
    it is by the cooperation of thousands. Even the water they drink, and the
    artificial light they use, are brought to them by elaborate machinery, requiring
    the constant labor and watchfulness of many men. They may travel at a speed
    incredible to the savage; but in doing so resign life and limb to the care
    of others. A broken rail, a drunken engineer, a careless switchman, may hurl
    them to eternity. And the power of applying labor to the satisfaction of
    desire passes, in the same way, beyond the direct control of the individual.
    The laborer becomes but part of a great machine, which may at any time be
    paralyzed by causes beyond his power, or even his foresight. Thus does the
    well-being of each become more and more dependent upon the well-being of
    all &#8212; the individual more and more subordinate to society.</p>
  <p>[11] In a simpler state master and man, neighbor and neighbor, know each
    other, and there is that touch of the elbow which, in times of danger, enables
    society to rally. But present tendencies are to the loss of this. In London,
    dwellers in one house do not know those in the next; the tenants of adjoining
    rooms are utter strangers to each other. Let civil conflict break or paralyze
    the authority that preserves order and the vast population would become a
    terror-stricken mob, without point of rally or principle of cohesion, and
    your London would be sacked and burned by an army of thieves. London is only
    the greatest of great cities. What is true of London is true of New York,
    and in the same measure true of the many cities whose hundreds of thousands
    are steadily growing toward millions. These vast aggregations of humanity,
    where he who seeks isolation may find it more truly than in the desert; where
    wealth and poverty touch and jostle; where one revels and another starves
    within a few feet of each other, yet separated by as great a gulf as that
    fixed between Dives in Hell and Lazarus in Abraham's bosom &#8212; they are
    centers and types of our civilization. Let jar or shock dislocate the complex
    and delicate organization, let the policeman's club be thrown down or wrested
    from him, and the fountains of the great deep are opened, and quicker than
    ever before chaos comes again. Strong as it may seem, our civilization is
    evolving destructive forces. Not desert and forest, but city slums and country
    roadsides are nursing the barbarians who may be to the new what Hun and Vandal
    were to the old.</p>
  <p>[18] The evils that begin to appear spring from the fact that the application
    of intelligence to social affairs has not kept pace with the application
    of intelligence to individual needs and material ends. Natural science strides
    forward, but political science lags. With all our progress in the arts which
    produce wealth, we have made no progress in securing its equitable distribution.
    Knowledge has vastly increased; industry and commerce have been revolutionized;
    but whether free trade or protection is best for a nation we are not yet
    agreed. We have brought machinery to a pitch of perfection that, fifty years
    ago, could not have been imagined; but, in the presence of political corruption,
    we seem as helpless as idiots. The East River bridge is a crowning triumph
    of mechanical skill; but to get it built a leading citizen of Brooklyn had
    to carry to New York sixty thousand dollars in a carpet bag to bribe New
    York aldermen. The human soul that thought out the great bridge is prisoned
    in a crazed and broken body that lies bedfast, and could watch it grow only
    by peering through a telescope. Nevertheless, the weight of the immense mass
    is estimated and adjusted for every inch. But the skill of the engineer could
    not prevent condemned wire being smuggled into the cable. <a href="../HG/SP/SP01_Increasing_Importance_of_Social_Questions.htm">...

look or what examples you select, you will
see that every form of enterprise, every step in material progress, is
only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the cream off for
himself, and everywhere today the man or the public body who wishes to
put land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land
values to the man who is putting it to an inferior use, and in some
cases to no use at all. All comes back to the land value, and its owner
for the time being is able to levy his toll upon all other forms of
wealth and upon every form of industry. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A portion, in some cases the whole, of
every benefit which is laboriously acquired by the community is
represented in the land value, and finds its way automatically into the
landlord's pocket.</span> If there is a rise in wages, rents are able
to move forward, because the workers can afford to pay a little more.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If the opening of a new railway or a
new tramway or the institution of
an improved service of workmen's trains or a lowering of fares or a new
invention or any other public convenience affords a benefit to the

and therefore the landlord and the ground landlord, one on top of the
other, are able to charge them more for the privilege of living there.</span></small><br>

  <li><small>Some years ago in London there was a<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> tollbar on a bridge across the
Thames</span>, and all the working people who lived on the south side
of the
river had to pay a daily toll of one penny for going and returning from
their work. The spectacle of these poor people thus mulcted on so large
a proportion of their earnings appealed to the public conscience, an
agitation was set on foot, municipal authorities were roused, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">at
the cost of the ratepayers the bridge was freed and the toll removed. </span>All
those people who used the bridge were saved sixpence a
week. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Within
a very short period from that time the rents on the south side of the
river were found to have advanced</span> by about sixpence a week, or
the
amount of the toll which had been remitted. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>And a friend of mine was
telling me the other day that in the parish of Southwark about L350 a
year, roughly speaking, was given away in doles of bread by charitable
people in connection with one of the churches, and as a consequence of
this the competition for small houses, but more particularly for
single-roomed tenements, is, we are told, so great that rents are
considerably higher than in the neighbouring district. All goes back to
the land, and the landowner, who in many cases, in most cases, is a
worthy person utterly unconscious of the character of the methods by
which he is enriched, is enabled with resistless strength to absorb to
himself a share of almost every public and every private benefit,
however important or however pitiful those benefits may be.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Now let the Manchester Ship Canal tell its tale about the land. It has
a story to tell which is just as simple and just as pregnant as its
story about Free Trade. When it was resolved to build the Canal, the
first thing that had to be done was to buy the land. Before the
resolution to build the Canal was taken, the land on which the Canal
flows -- or perhaps I should say 'stands' -- was, in the main,
agricultural land, paying rates on an assessment from 30s. to L2 an
acre. I am told that 4,495 acres of land purchased fell within that
description out of something under 5,000 purchased altogether.
Immediately after the decision, the 4,495 acres were sold for L777,000
sterling -- or an average of L172 an acre -- that is to say, five or
six times the agricultural value of the land and the value on which it
had been rated for public purposes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now what had the landowner done
for
the community; what enterprise had he shown; what service had he
rendered; what capital had he risked in order that he should gain this
enormous multiplication of the value of his property! I will tell you
in one word what he had done. Can you guess it! Nothing.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>But it was not only the owners of the land that was needed for
making
the Canal, who were automatically enriched. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All the
surrounding land
either having a frontage on the Canal or access to it rose and rose
rapidly, and splendidly, in value. By the stroke of a fairy wand,
without toil, without risk, without even a half-hour's thought many
landowners in Salford, Eccles, Stretford, Irlam, Warrington Runcorn,
etc., found themselves in possession of property which had trebled,
quadrupled, quintupled in value.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from the high prices which were paid, there was a heavy
bill for
compensation, severance, disturbance, and injurious affection where no
land was taken -- injurious affection, namely, raising the land not
taken many times in value -- all this was added to the dead-weight cost
of construction. All this was a burden on those whose labour skill, and
capital created this great public work. Much of this land today is
still rated at ordinary agricultural value, and in order to make sure
that no injustice is done, in order to make quite certain that these
landowners are not injured by our system of government, half their
rates are, under the Agricultural Rates Act, paid back to them. The
balance is made up by you. The land is still rising in value, and with
every day's work that every man in this neighbourhood does and with
every addition to the prosperity of Manchester and improvement of this
great city, the land is further enhanced in value. ... <a

  the land does or would command for use per annum if offered in open market
  -- the annual value of the exclusive use in control of a given area of land,

    command of, facilities for commerce and communication with the world -- an
    artificial value created primarily through public expenditure of taxes. For
    the sake of brevity, the substance of this definition may be conveniently
    expressed as the value of &quot;proximity.&quot; It is ordinarily measured
    by interest on investment plus taxes.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it's difficult for people to understand the meaning of "rent" as
    an economic concept. One way I&nbsp;have of explaining it doesn't use the
    word rent. I just use a little analogy.</p>
  <p>I'm from Crete, Nebraska. It's a small town of 5,000 people.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose a man comes to Crete, and he wants to start a business. He needs
      a building, but first he needs a piece of ground to build this new building
      on. So he looks up a real estate agent, describes what he wants, and the
      real estate agent shows him a parcel that's just right for his needs. The
      man asks the agent, "All right, now how much money do you want for this
      land?" The agent says, "It's worth $50,000." The man says, "Why is it worth
      $50,000?" And the real estate agent points out that "The school is good,
      the roads are good, the police department is good, the rescue crew is good
      and very fast, and business is good here." </p>
    <p>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a fair price. I'll
      take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school people, and the road people,
      and the police department? To whom do I pay the $50,000?" And the real
      estate agent says, "Oh no. You don't pay it to them. You pay it to the
      person who owned the land before."</p>
    <p>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads, and the police,
      and the other good things?" And the real estate agent says, "<i>If</i> you
      build, then you'll pay for them again."</p>
    <p>The buyer then asks, &quot;And what will the previous owner do for me
      for my $50,000?&quot;&nbsp; The real estate man answers, &quot;Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing
      at all!&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One consequence of levying
additional taxes on land is that it
becomes possible to lower taxes on other things. One of the things

Lowering taxes on improvements makes the present value of land
development very much less costly, and hence is likely to accelerate
development although it would be possible to construct cases in which
the effect of lowering taxes on improvements would be to postpone
development. Whether it retards or accelerates development, the
lowering of taxes on improvements results in more intensive
development when development occurs. The possibility of promoting
more intensive development by reducing or eliminating taxes on
improvements is an important beneficial effect of an increase in
taxes on land.</small></p>

Services to land such as sewers, water and electricity are used most
effectively when they are priced at marginal cost. The costs of these
services, however, are generally such that the sum of marginal costs
will not cover total costs. Land taxes have the potential to provide
a fund to cover the difference between total costs and the sum of
marginal costs. If land taxes are so used, the reductions in the

<small>VI. Conclusion: A greater perspective</small><br>
<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small>While, at first sight, the prospect of
sprawling cities with lots of open space and possible greenery might be
appealing from an environmental perspective, a closer examination
should lead to a different conclusion. The inducement to collect
windfall profits (resulting from the failure of society to apply LVT)
encourages some landholders to withhold vacant land from the market and
forces new development to "<span style="font-weight: bold;">leapfrog</span>"
this land and move further out.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hence there is an unnecessary outlay
in roads, pipelines, power
supplies and other infrastructure which must service a greater area.
</span>Commuting journeys, similarly, must now consume greater
resources.
Financially inducing land to be put to its optimal use is not
"flogging" the land, but is rather ensuring land is carefully used and
that we only exploit as much as we properly need.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But LVT has much more to contribute to the question of
low-impact urban
function, in the form of affordable and efficient public transport and
other desirable infrastructure. The principle reason why public
transport options are presently so limited is because the
taxpayer-funded investment in this and other forms of infrastructure
effectively disappears, in an almost unseen manner, into the "Black
Hole" of landowners' pockets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>That is, <span style="font-weight: bold;">not only is the
resulting
compact cityscape more amenable to the provision of public transport
(not to mention walking and riding), but LVT makes the investment in
such infrastructure affordable because the resulting enhanced land
values are "recycled" back into public coffers.</span> The extension of
<span style="font-weight: bold;">London's Jubilee line</span>
underground network, which opened in 1999, provides a good case in
point of how desirable infrastructure can be self-funding if land
values are recaptured. An independent study was performed which
assessed the increase in land values extending to 800 yards from each
of the 10 stations. The accumulated gain (to private landowners) was
estimated to be around &pound;13 billion, courtesy of the &pound;3.5
billion of
taxpayers funds it took to build the line!&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<br>
<small>"Construction" is usually added, but construction per se is
innocent and should not bear the onus.&nbsp; It is rather grading, the
destruction that precedes construction on new lands, that denudes land
and allows runoff and blowing.&nbsp; Filling can be noxious, too, when
it takes wetlands that otherwise help filter runoff before it hits
shellfish beds and beaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>So nice a distinction may seem picky, but it is heavy with
policy meaning.&nbsp; The Sears Tower and the Empire State Building
probably caused less runoff than any modern cookie&#8209;cutter
subdivision.&nbsp; We can have needed construction without grading and
filling by renewing and infilling our cities instead of promoting more
urban sprawl.&nbsp; Milwaukee in the last 20 years has lost 20% of its
population.&nbsp; Buildings are boarded up and land lies vacant while
dozers and scrapers tear up new land upstream of it.&nbsp; At least
one&#8209;third of Milwaukee, perhaps more, could and should be renewed
forthwith, obviating much of the random lateral expansion onto new land
whose runoff now causes so much grief down here.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>Within agriculture it is common to hear that tillage is the
problem; the solution, evidently, is grazing.&nbsp; On some lands that
is true, but the generalization is not.&nbsp; On other more fragile
lands, grazing causes runoff.&nbsp; Not for nothing are sheep called
"woolly maggots," and the Arab called the father, rather than the son
of the desert.&nbsp; Exploitive high-grading grazing, leaving weeds to
take over the range, is another form of pollution &#8212; biological
pollution, depleting the gene pool.&nbsp; As with all land problems,
"where" and "when" are as important as "what."&nbsp; "A place for
everything, and everything in its place," the slogan of land economics,
is the proper watchword.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>We sometimes hear that good organic manure is the answer.&nbsp;
But on feedlots, too much of a good thing becomes a nonpoint
pollutant.&nbsp; Cities in the upper Santa Ana River basin must provide
tertiary sewage treatment, but the largest concentration of dairy
cattle in the world, in the Chino basin, drains into the same
waters.&nbsp; Next time you visit Disneyland if the water reminds you
of Wisconsin, there may be a reason.&nbsp; (Chino, ironically, is in an
agricultural preserve, to enhance the environment.)&nbsp; These
feedlots also overlie what might be one of our most usable aquifers, in
a region in sorest need of water storage.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>Cities like Milwaukee are painted as victims of nonpoint
pollution, but within cities the great anomaly is that the output of
sanitary sewers is monitored and treated while that of storm sewers is
not.&nbsp; A few blocks from this meeting in downtown Milwaukee you can
see coal and salt stored in the open, draining directly into the Harbor
with each rain.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>In Riverside, the local scatological whimsy is "Flush your
toilets, Orange County needs the water."&nbsp; It relieves the local
inferiority complex, but actually that water gets tertiary
treatment.&nbsp; It is our storm runoff that's dirty.&nbsp; Some cities
of course have only one set of sewers, but that creates problems of its
own which Milwaukee knows well.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>In Riverside we have also poisoned many of our own water wells
with toxic percolation from farm and industry wastes which, since they
are inside our expansive city limits, we cannot blame on others; but
which our prudent city fathers prefer not to identify too
closely.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small><a style="font-weight: bold;"

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><font size="3"><small>What's won or lost is a value generated by
society. That is,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> land rises in value </span></small></font></small><small><font size="3"><small></small></font></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where a new resource is
discovered (during a gold rush, more money is made by land developers
than by prospectors), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where population grows (see the Sun
Belt and
verdant Northwest), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where technology advances (witness
the land values
in the various Silicon Valleys, Forests, etc), 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">where
infrastructure
expands (e.g., near a new road or sewer), and </span>    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>where society cooperates
(e.g., in communities that organize street fairs, neighborhood watches,
etc). 
    </small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="3"><small>These
factors driving land value are not improvements made by
lone owners but by the entire community. The closest correlation to
land value is density and no one person creates that. Hence the site
value levy merely puts public values in the public treasury for public
benefit, as untaxing homes, sales, and income leaves
privately-generated values in private pockets. ... </small></font></small><br>
<br>
<small><font size="3"><small>The failed policy that the PTS would
replace
is the present property tax. This is actually two taxes in one, one on
land and another on improvements. The tax on improvements penalizes
owners for improving. This negative incentive does its greatest damage
at the margin, where profit is slim. There, rather than pay a higher
tax, owners let buildings dilapidate into slums. The lack of much tax
on land keeps overhead on speculators affordable. This negative
incentive lets owners under-utilize prime sites, even withhold them
from use entirely. Kept from prime sites, development sprawls outward.</small></font></small><br>
<small><font size="3"><small></small></font></small><br>
<small><font size="3"><small>Sprawl inflates the values of suburban and
rural land. Leap-frog
development raises a few spikes in a land value map that soon pull up
values everywhere, increasing the property tax burden of owners of
previously developed sites, unless the tax is capped. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The resultant
sprawl also raises enormously the cost of extending infrastructure and
makes auto-dependency a given.</span></small></font></small><br>
<small><font size="3"><small></small></font></small><br>
<small><font size="3"><small>The PTS reverses all these negative
consequences. </small></font></small><small><font size="3"><small></small></font></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than burden
construction, taxing only land spares it. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than spread
development (hooking us on cars), taxing land concentrates it
(providing a market for mass transit). 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than inflate land price,
a land tax squashes it. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than enrich the owners of
prime sites or
itself, a land-taxing government could rebate some collected site rent
as a dividend, perhaps in the form of a Housing Voucher, making home
ownership inflation-proof.</small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="3"><small>A big
problem needs a big solution which in turn needs a

<p>The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a> (1881)&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Land Values intended by
Providence for Public Purposes.</b>
</small><br>
<small>I have already observed that the chief peculiarity of the land
of
a country was that its value was never stationary, that it was always
progressive and rising, that in fact it increased in a direct ratio
with the growth of the population and the advancing progress of the
industry of the nation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would seem as if Providence had
destined the land to serve as a
large economical reservoir, to catch, to collect and preserve the
overflowing streams of wealth that are constantly escaping from the
great public industrial works that are always going on in communities
that are progressive and prosperous.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides the permanent improvements
that are made in the land
itself, and which increase its productiveness and value, there are
other industrial works not carried out on the land itself, but on its
surroundings and in its vicinity, and which enhance its value very
considerably. A new road is made for the accommodation of a district;
a new bridge is thrown across a river or a stream to make two
important localities accessible to each other; a new railway passes
close by and connects it with certain large and important centres of
industry; a new factory or a new mill is erected, or a new town is
built in the neighbourhood.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Industrial works like these add
very materially to the value of
all the land in their vicinity. It is a well-known fact that a new
railway has in several instances doubled the value of the land
through which it passed, in consequence of the increased facilities
it had afforded for the sale of its agricultural products.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In every state of society, which
is progressive and improving,
such industrial works are continually going on, and hence the value
of the land is rising also everywhere. But its value rises enormously
with the enlarged growth of the population of a nation, and with the
increased productiveness of its industry. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Great National Property
Which Landlords Are Permitted to
Appropriate.</b>
</small><br>
<small>But now the great national property which Providence has
destined
for the support of the public burdens of society has been diverted
from its original purpose to minister to the wants, the necessities,
and perhaps the extravagance of a class. The explanation of this
extraordinary act of national spoliation will be found in the fact
that hitherto this class could just do as it pleased; the government
of the country lay for centuries exclusively in its hands, and
despite the combined influence of "English radicalism" and "Irish
obstructionism" it is practically in its hands still. The enormous
value, then, thus superadded to the land from the two sources just
indicated passes directly with the land itself into the hands of
those who own it.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those who hold the ownership of
the land hold also the ownership
of all the accessions of value it receives from all quarters. This
increase in the value of their property cost no sacrifice, demanded
no painful effort of labour. Even while they slept their rent rolls
went on increasing and multiplying.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The value continually imparted to
the land by the industrial
exertions of the community, in the construction of harbours and
bridges, in the making of new roads and railways, in the erection of
new factories, mills and houses, etc., has all gone with the land,
has all been confiscated and appropriated by the owners of the
soil.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Cairnes feels sorely
perplexed to account for some of
the anomalous results of this appropriation. He says: "A bale of
cloth, a machine, a house, owes its value to the labour expended upon
it, and belongs to the person who expends or employs the labour; a
piece of land owes its value, so far as its value is affected by the
causes I am now considering, not to the labour expended on the land,
but that expended on something else -- the labour expended in making
a railroad or in building houses in an adjoining town; and the value
thus added to the land belongs not to the persons who have made the
railroads or built the houses, but to someone who may not have been
aware that these operations were being carried on -- nay, who perhaps
has exerted all his efforts to prevent their being carried on. How
many landlords have their rent rolls doubled by railways made in
their despite!"</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Professor's Unwitting
Testimony</b>
</small><br>
<small>It never occurred to Mr. Cairnes that he had here given, quite
unconsciously to himself, an unanswerable argument, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ex absurdo</span>, to
prove the injustice of the appropriation of the land. If the land had
not been confiscated no such absurd or unjust result could have
followed. The value imparted by labour to the land, exactly like "the
bale of cloth, the house or the machine," would belong to the persons
who expended or employed that labour, that is to say, to the public,
by whose industrial exertions it had been created.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Lastly, the vast accessions of
value which the land is constantly
receiving from the proceeds of that "self-imposed tax" which the
nation levies on itself in the high prices it pays for the "raw
products of the soil," together with the increased productiveness of
the soil itself, go all, as Mr. Cairnes is forced to confess,
"neither to profits nor to wages nor to the public at large, but to
swell a fund ever growing, even while its proprietors sleep -- to the
rent roll of the owner of the soil."<a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html"><span

Kingsfield in the long-running TV series, The Paper Chase, later became
the pitchman for Smith Barney. In that advertisement, his tag line was
"We make money the old-fashioned way -- we earn it."</small><br>
<br>
<small>That we should earn our money rather than live off the efforts
of
others seems a simple enough moral tenet. But it seems to have lost its
cogency in contemporary economic thought. More than a century ago John
Stuart Mill noted that</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Landlords
grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold
title.</span><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(1)
</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Today, on the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
unearned surplus which classical
economists called rent</span> attaches to monopoly titles -- largely
the
scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(2)</span></small> The
surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
rightful entitlement.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Where does economic rent most
tend to lodge? In the center of cities
where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
personal or market exchanges. </span>The land value in New York City
is higher
than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an
obsolete power plant, not have to be razed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(3)</span></small> Land
values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend also
to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
areas. Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in the
United States illustrate the point. <strong>...</strong> </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>...</strong> capital investments affect the
market value of
locational sites by conveying rent to those in any way benefitting from
the service. That rent accruing to proximate sites and can easily
recaptured to pay off the debt service of project construction.
Typically rent collection is ignored, however, left instead in the
hands of titleholders whose sites are serviced by the infrastructure
investment. This drives speculation in land, with all the negative
effects it brings both economically and politically. In fact the rent
created by capital investment in transportation can be enormous. <span

of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He realized that

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Land Rent</strong></p>
  <p> From the standpoint of an economic geographer and for some land economists,
      land rent is simply capitalized transportation cost. Land rent is the surplus
      generated by social activity on or in the vicinity of locational sites that
      accrues to titleholders of those parcels. Whether or not it is recaptured by
      public policy, rent is a natural factor deriving from the intensive use of
      natural capital. One must return to nineteenth-century classical economics
      to appreciate the importance of economic rent or land rent; neoclassical economic
      frameworks have largely discarded it.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font> More
      intensive use of high-value land sites leads to site configurations that
      are less dependent on transportation services. Land rent is highest where
      the greatest
      traffic and market exchanges occur, that being at the center of large conurbations.
      Comparing land values of urban property parcels, the highest land rent
      in the urban cores and traffic junctures are analogous to the contours
      of land elevations.
      Mountain peaks gradually slope down to valleys and flatland regions and
      continue outward until at distant points &#8212; perhaps at the poles of the earth &#8212; land
      sites have no market value at all.</p>
  <p>The differentials in land values are profound, even more than most people
      realize. In 1995, in the small city of Ithaca, New York, the highest quintile
      of land had a value of over $56,000 per acre in the downtown center, whereas
      the lowest quintile only a mile away falls to less than $3,000.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Large
      city centers have far higher site prices. Even in Polk County, Iowa (which
      includes Des Moines), in the middle of cornfields where I did a study two years
      ago, the highest urban value land site was $31.3 million per acre, which quickly
      declined to about $20,000 per acre only about a mile away. In the spring of
      1998, one land parcel (the building was to be razed) of less than an acre in
      New York City's Times Square and split in two pieces by Broadway was sold by
      Prudential Life to Disney for roughly $240 million.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15]</em></strong></font> To
      take another instance, a nine-acre tract on the East River in New York City
      occupied by an obsolete power plant was purchased by Mort Zuckerman to build
      high-rise condominiums two years ago. The sale price was in the neighborhood
      of $680 million and would have been higher were it not for some enormous costs
      associated with the demolition of the old structures.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[16]</em></strong></font> It
      should be noted that the overwhelming proportion of land value is in cities;
      relatively speaking, the site values of peripheral lands, typically used for
      agriculture and timber growth, are negligible. Land values are high in urban
      areas because, over time, rent accrues to a site. Each improvement in proximity
      to a property parcel enhances the value of all other parcels. This makes even
      unimproved sites attractive objects for speculation, particularly when land
      sites surrounding it are to be improved by adding either transportation service
      or new structures. One nine-mile stretch of interstate highway in Albany, New
      York, costing $125 million to construct, has yielded $3.8 billion in increased
      land values (constant dollars) within just two miles of its corridor in the
      forty years of its existence.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17]</em></strong></font> This
      is a thirty-fold return in a time span typically used for bond repayment! The
      Washington Metro created increments in land value along much of the 101-mile
      system completed by 1980 that easily exceeded $3.5 billion, compared with the
      $2.7 billion of federal funds invested in Metro up until that time.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[18]</em></strong></font> Any
      major building construction project, private or public, will have a similar
      effect on adjacent land sites. Differentials in land value can have a profound
      effect on decisions made by titleholders, either positively by inducing appropriate
      development in urban cores or negatively by giving monopoly titleholders power
      to hold sites out of use for long-term speculative gain. Such decisions of
      course determine the character of urban configurations and society as well.... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <div align="left"><small>The efficiency that is entailed in using the rent
      of land to finance public activities applies to certain other sources of
      public revenue as well:</small>
      <blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
          as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
          radio and TV broadcasts. </small> </blockquote>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources.
        Such payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
        revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small> </p>
    <p align="left"><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise
        that pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
        estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
        on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
        cost.</small> </p>
    <p align="left"><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
        value of surrounding land.</small> </p>
    <p align="left"><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking
        in crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities
        for others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that
        it is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be handled
        sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent that
        they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small> </p>
    <p align="left"><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of
        alcohol, which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small> </p>
    <p align="left"><small><strong>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
        electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
        make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
        is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
        he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they increase
        publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not covered
        by user charges.</strong></small><strong> </strong></p>
    <p align="left"><small><strong>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements
          to land, at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
          tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
          to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements).
          He pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes
          to may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax
          is that it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment,
          and to identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
          purposes.</strong></small></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
        of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be collected
        even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any excess can
        be returned to the population on an equal per capita basis. </span>If
        these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to finance necessary
        public expenditures, then the least damaging additional tax would probably
        be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on all residents. If some residents
        are regarded to be incapable of paying such a tax, then the next most
        efficient tax is a proportional tax on income up to some specified amount.
        Then there is no disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax
        limit. The next most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
  <p align="left"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not
        to tax the profits of corporations</span>. Capital moves from where it
        is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate of return is earned
        everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing corporations they will invest
        more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be higher, and the rent of land, collected
        by the government, will be higher. The least damaging tax on corporations
        is one that provides a complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over
        of tax credits to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the
        government a partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
        provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
        receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive for
        entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when investment is
        expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such a tax requires
        that everyone believe that the tax rate will never change. Thus it is
        best not to tax the profits of corporations at all. If the people of
        St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of corporations, then they
        should invest directly in the corporations, either privately or publicly.
        The residents of St. Petersburg would be best served by refraining from
        taxing the profits of corporations. Creating a place where profits are
        not taxed can be expected to attract so much capital that the resulting
        rises in wages and in government-collected rents will more than offset
        what might have been collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
  <p align="left"><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one
      of two features. </small></p>
  <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is that
          it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among competing
          potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use of the frequency
          spectrum and for depleting natural resources share this feature. <br>
      </small></li>
      <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is that
          of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the person who
          pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on pollution, taxes on
          other activities that reduce the value of surrounding land, taxes on
          imposing congestion and other costs on other residents of the city,
          charges for the marginal cost of publicly provided services, and a
          self-assessed tax on property, reflecting the hindrance to future growth
          represented by existing development. </small></li>
    </ul>
    <small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to attract capital
    rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth, raising the wages of its
    citizens and the publicly-collected rent of its land.</small> ...<a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

    Land Value Taxation to Problems of Environmental Protection, Congestion,
    Efficient Resource Use, Population, and Economic Growth</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land value taxation is usually thought of as a possible source of revenue
    for local governments. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But the ethical principle
    that supports it is most coherent when the principal is applied on a global
    basis: All persons in the world have equal rights to natural opportunities.
    This does not mean that all persons in the world have equal rights to all
    land rent. To the extent that the rent of land arises as a result of the
    provision
    of infrastructure, that rent is the natural income of the polity that provided
    the infrastructure, and the logical source for financing it. What all persons
    in the
  world have equal rights to is the "pre-development" rental value of land, the
  rental value that land would have to the potential developer of a new community
  if there were no community and no
  infrastructure. </span>To motivate the application of land value taxation to
  other areas of economic life, I will assume that there is a global agreement
  that, because all persons have equal rights to natural opportunities, there
  will be transfers among nations to equalize per capita pre-development rent.
  The principle
  behind this agreement is
  then extended to other issues. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">read

    Land Value Taxation</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Consider a system of states and localities in which both state and local governments
    finance their activities by taxing every parcel of land in their jurisdictions,
    according to the rental value that the parcel would have if it were unimproved.
    Suppose that a state government placed a tax of 10% on the value that land
    would have if it were unimproved, and suppose that there was a local project
    that would cost $95,000 per year and raise the rental value of local land by
    $100,000 per year. The project would be socially beneficial, and if there were
    no national tax on the rental value of land, the local government would find
    that undertaking the project would improve the welfare of its citizens. However,
    one effect of the project would be to increase by $10,000 (10% of $100,000)
    the amount of money that the citizens of the locality were required to pay
    to the state government. Therefore it would not be in their interest to undertake
    the project. Thus taxation of the rental value of land by both states and localities
  does not promote efficiency in a federal system. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Revenue_Sharing.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> George saw land as a community resource provided by nature, to which every
    human being had an equal right. He argued that, since land was fixed in supply,
    the system of private land ownership allowed the wealthy few to enjoy exclusive
    rights to land and its benefits, while alienating the poorer majority from
    land ownership and forcing them to pay rent to landowners in order to access
    this necessary resource. Moreover, the collection of rents by landowners
    allowed them to increase their wealth without contributing to the productive
    efforts of society. As the population grew, so too did the demand for land,
    forcing rents and land values ever higher. <strong>In addition, increases
    in land value resulting from publicly-funded developments, such as roads
    and public transport systems, unduly benefited landowners at the expense
    of the community.</strong> Such unearned gains from landownership encouraged
    speculation in land, pushing prices even higher, while exposing the economy
    to the risks of speculative &#8216;booms&#8217; and &#8216;busts&#8217;. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Indeed, one could say that the term &#8216;tax&#8217; is a misnomer because
    what is really involved is value created by the community being retained
    by the community rather than being appropriated by private landholders. For
    example, <strong>under current arrangements landowners receive &#8216;windfall&#8217; gains
    when the market value of their land rises as a result of publicly provided
    infrastructure being built nearby, or when local government zoning decisions
    reclassify their land as appropriate for further development. In this way,
    individual landowners stand to reap huge benefits at the expense of community-generated
    processes.</strong> Such arrangements create an odd incentive: allowing landholders
    to appropriate the unearned wealth generated by rising land values, thereby
    rewarding this unproductive activity, while taxing productive endeavour.
    The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217;, by contrast, would eliminate
    such perverse incentives and thereby more effectively align private and public
    interests in the use of society&#8217;s resources. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read
