<blockquote>
  <p>As we think about what America is trying to do in Iraq, it is worth thinking
      about who it is that is going to reap the benefits of the oil under Iraqi sand.
      Should it be a few Iraqis? Should it be a few American corporations and their
      shareholders?  Should it be all  the people who live in the districts where
      the oil is pumped? Should it be all the people of Iraq? Who should decide?</p>
  <p>Similarly, when America invests in rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure, who benefits?
      Is it accurate to say that everyone who lives in the areas served benefits,
      or is there another, more precise, answer to that question? Does the answer
      to that question depend on whether the homeownership rate is 10%, 50% or 90%?
      Does the answer to that question depend on whether 10% of businesses are conducted
      on properties owned by those who operate them, 50% or 90%? </p>
  <p>In America, urban land is a very valuable resource, often more valuable than
      land that can be mined for its natural resources. Who should benefit from increases
      in its value? Who should be able to privatize the rent on urban land, be it
      Iraq's or America's? Is is acceptable for individuals to pocket the land value
      if they are local residents? Is it acceptable for individuals to pocket the
      land value if they are foreigners? Is it acceptable for corporations to pocket
      the land value? Does it matter whether those corporations' shareholders are
      locals or foreigners?</p>
  <p>Is there a handy alternative to the value of land or natural resources being
      privatized? Absolutely! Shift taxes off work, off trade (sales), and off
    buildings, and instead place the tax burden on land and on natural resources.
    We won't
      use any less of either one, but instead of a few individuals pocketing
    something they didn't create, all of us will benefit &#8212; equally. And
    we'll all benefit from a healthier economy. </p>
  <p>Alaska's approach, to invest a portion of the oil proceeds for the future
      for the people of Alaska, is a sound one. Alaska already has low taxes, because
      much of the cost of state government is coming from oil revenues. And with
      powerful representatives in the Senate who see that Federal money is spent
      in ways that benefit Alaska's property owners, Alaskans tend to be in a good
      situation.</p>

  <p><small>... This equitable and

  approach to securing the human right to the earth.</small></p>
  <p>    <small>One of the best examples of the beneficial results of an ethic
    of koinonia in natural resources is to be found in the state of <a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/themes/Alaska.html">Alaska</a> where an "earth rights" constitution
    gives ownership of the oil and other natural resources of the state to the
    citizens of Alaska on an
    equal basis. The Alaska Permanent Fund invests the state's oil resource
    rents, the interest from which funds cash dividend payments directly to
    all adults and children resident in the state at least one year.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The Permanent Fund ended fiscal year 2004 on June 30 with a 14.1
    percent return and a total value of more than $27.4 billion, according
    to currently available Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation figures. More
    than $24,000 per person have been distributed to citizens of Alaska
    since 1982. Note that Alaska is the only state in the US wherein the
    wealth gap has decreased during recent decades.<small><span

    <br>
    <small>The Alaska Permanent Fund is an innovative and important model
    of
    resource rents for citizen dividends, but with worldwide oil production
    nearing peak, it is the opinion of this writer that oil resource rents
    had best be directed to the development of renewable energy
    technologies. The electromagnetic spectrum, geo-orbital zones, and
    surface land values would be a more appropriate source of rent
    distribution as citizen dividend payments.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Had the land problem been addressed in the south after the Civil

DIVIDENDS AND OIL RESOURCE RENTS</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Abstract:</b> Citizens of
Alaska have been receiving
individual dividend checks from an oil rent trust fund since 1982.
Norway&sup1;s citizens receive substantial social services and invest
oil rents in a permanent fund for the future. Nigeria has yet to
establish a similar fund for its oil revenue stream. This paper
explores the oil rent institutions of Alaska, Norway and Nigeria with
a focus on these questions: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are citizen dividends from oil rent funds
currently or potentially a source of substantial basic income? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are
oil rent funds the best source for citizen dividends or should CDs be
based on other types of resource rents?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The paper recommends full use
of information and communication
technologies for transparency in extractive resource industries,
that resource rent from non-renewable resources should be invested in
socially and environmentally responsible ways and primarily in the
needed transition to renewable energy based economies, and that oil
and other non-renewable resource rent funds should transition towards
capturing substantial resource rents from surface land site values
(ground rent) and other permanent and sustainable sources of rent for
possible distribution of citizen dividends. <a href="../docs/Hartzok_citdivs_oil.html">read the whole article</a><br>

early on set out to limit its social dividend to citizens with five

this provision a barrier to interstate migration, and struck it down.

<blockquote>
    <p>The efficiency of the competitive equilibrium requires that the sharing
      of the pre-development rental value of land (that part of the rental value
      of land that is not accounted for by local public goods) and the value
      of other natural opportunities be unaffected by migration or political
      competition.
      If the distribution of the returns to natural opportunities depends on
      where people live or on political competition, then efficiency will fall
      because
      of inefficient location decisions and rent seeking losses. For example,
      if the returns to oil in Alaska are divided among the people who live in
      Alaska,
      then people will move to Alaska inefficiently to share in the bounty. If
      the distribution of the returns to natural opportunities depends on political
      competition, then there will be rent-seeking losses from such competition.
      A non-exploitive and reasonably efficient local public sector is thus possible
      through
  competition among communities. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read

  <p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington and the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>, argued that, while some forms
        of wealth are produced by human activity, and are rightly the property of
        the producers (or those who have obtained them from the previous owners by
        voluntary gift or exchange), land and natural resources are bestowed by God
        on the human race, and that every one of the N inhabitants of the earth has
        a claim to 1/Nth of the coal beds, 1/Nth of the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines,
        and 1/Nth of the fertile soil. God wills a society where everyone may sit
        in peace under his own vine and his own fig tree.</p>
    <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of
        land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
        of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
        Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the
        use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty
        years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary
        owner.</p>
    <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
        of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
        expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
        owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
        a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here I
        am anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
        in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
    <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
        of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements
      on it, practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not the
      original
        sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose to hold
      his &quot;fair
        share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay a land tax about equal
        to his dividend check, and so would break even. By 1/Nth of the land
        is meant
        land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the value of all the land in the
        country.</p>
    <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
        as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to hold
        more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would prefer
        to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check representing
        the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
    <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
        at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough to
        feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and 1/Nth
        of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population. A family
        of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend checks will
        enable them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied to that
        land is enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of course, they
        may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably, but the situation
        from which we start is one in which everyone has his own plot of ground from
        which to wrest a living by the strength of his own back, and any deviation
        from this is the result of voluntary exchanges agreed to by the parties directly
        involved, who judge themselves to be better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
    <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is extremely
        conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic ideas
      about land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles
      or gold
        or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking countries
        uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal property
        (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite
        of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
        means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the people.
        Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
        term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that
        the landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
        for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to
        property
        other than land, although complications arise when there are buildings
        on the land that is being seized.</p>
    <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
      support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
      Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
      Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
      F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized
      by Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and
      the Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight
      of the Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of the
      proposals of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton
      Friedman</a>, 1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco Modigliani,
      1985; James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
      S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
    <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
        cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
        tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is
      about to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value of the land
        and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure you that real
        estate assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice to make
        the two assessments
        separately, and a parcel of land in the business district of a large
        city very often has a different owner from the building on it.) Many
        cities have
        moved to a system of taxing land more heavily than improvements, and
        most have been pleased with the results, finding that landholders are
        more likely
        to use their land productively -- to their own benefit and that of the
        public -- if their taxes do not automatically go up when they improve
        their land
        by constructing or maintaining buildings on it.</p>
    <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
        proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental and
        reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results of
        a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the difference
        in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other proposals of
        the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me absolute dictator
        of the world so that I can supervise the distribution, and if it doesn't
        work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that absolute dictators
        seldom resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

      3.0 &#8212; Chapter 3: The Limits of Government (pages 33-48)</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Limits of Public Ownership</p>
    <p>Because of historical circumstances, America has a long tradition of public
      land ownership. When Europeans first arrived, North America was held in
      common by an assortment of tribes. As these tribes were dispossessed, the
      federal government acquired their territories. Some of the federal holdings
      were given to states as they entered the union. Though most of what the
      federal and state governments owned was then sold cheaply, much was retained.
      Today, nearly a third of the land in the United States is government-owned.</p>
    <p>To say that land &#8212; or any asset &#8212; is &#8220;government-owned,&#8221; however,
      isn&#8217;t to say it&#8217;s managed on behalf of future generations,
      nonhuman species, or ordinary citizens. Consider what the federal and state
      governments have done with the lands they own.</p>
    <p>Outside of Alaska, about 5 percent of government-owned lands have been
      designated as wilderness. In such areas, humans may enter on foot but not
      use motorized vehicles. Mining, logging, and hunting are also prohibited.
      On the other 95 percent of government-owned land, private and commercial
      use is regulated by various agencies. National forests are managed by the
      U.S. Forest Service, grazing and mineral lands by the Bureau of Land Management,
      hunting and fishing by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, politics &#8212; not fiduciary duty &#8212; determines
      what uses are permitted and what prices are charged. A classic example
      is the Mining Act of 1872, under which private companies can stake claims
      to mineral-bearing lands for $5 an acre, and pay no royalties on the minerals
      they extract. Every attempt to reform this antiquated law has failed because
      of the mining companies&#8217; political clout.</p>
    <p>In the same vein, the U.S. Forest Service has for decades been selling
      trees to timber companies for below-market prices. On top of that, it spends
      billions of tax dollars building roads in virgin forests so timber firms
      can harvest the people&#8217;s trees. This is, of course, economically
      irrational and a huge subsidy to private corporations. It also addicts
      Americans to cheap forest products and destructive logging methods. These
      practices occur because the Forest Service is not a trust committed to
      ecosystem preservation, but a politically influenced agency dedicated to &#8220;multiple
      use&#8221; of government-owned forests.</p>
    <p>There are exceptions to this dismal pattern. One involves trust lands
      given by the federal government to states. Such gifts began with the Land
      Ordinance of 1785, which reserved one square mile per township for the
      support of public schools. Later, the Morrill Land Grant College Act of
      1862 gave more land to states to support colleges of agriculture and mechanics.
      And in 1954, Congress gave Texas title to oil-rich coastal lands, providing
      that all revenue from them be placed in an endowment, or permanent fund,
      that generates income for public schools forever.</p>
    <p>Today, twenty-two states hold about 155 million acres in trust for public
      schools and colleges &#8212; which is to say, for future generations. Like
      the federal government, the state trusts lease much of their land for oil
      drilling, timber cutting, and cattle grazing. The trusts&#8217; duty is
      to preserve not the land itself but the income streams it generates. This
      creates beneficiaries (educators, students, parents) who monitor the land
      managers closely. One result, according to University of California professor
      Sally Fairfax, is that state trust lands are better managed than federally
      owned lands. Whereas the U.S. Forest Service &#8220;has been hiding the
      ball on cash flows and returns to investments for most of this century
      . . . the state trust land managers know how to keep books and make them
      public.&#8221; Further, even though the state trusts aren&#8217;t bound
      to protect ecosystems per se, they tend to do so because they have a long-term
      calculus.</p>
    <p>An interesting variant of the typical state land trust is the <strong>Alaska
        Permanent Fund</strong>, created in 1976 to absorb some of the windfall from leasing state
      land to oil companies. The aim was to create an endowment that would benefit
      Alaskans even after the oil is gone. To this end, the Permanent Fund invests
      in stocks, bonds, and similar assets, and off the earnings pays yearly
      dividends to every resident. Originally, the dividends were to be allocated
      in proportion to the recipients&#8217; length of residence in Alaska, with
      old-timers getting more than newcomers. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
      that, because of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
      Alaska couldn&#8217;t discriminate against newcomers that way. The dividend
      formula was then changed to one person, one share.</p>
    <p><strong>THE ALASKA PERMANENT FUND</strong><br>
      Under Alaska&#8217;s constitution, the state&#8217;s natural resources
      belong to its people. Jay Hammond, Republican governor of Alaska in the
      1970s, took this provision seriously.When oil began flowing from the North
      Slope, he pushed for royalties to be shared among Alaska&#8217;s citizens.
      Many battles later, the legislature agreed to a deal: 75 percent of the
      state&#8217;s oil revenue would go to the government as a replacement for
      taxes.The remaining 25 percent would flow into the Alaska Permanent Fund,
      and would be invested on behalf of all Alaskans equally.</p>
    <p>Since 1982, the Fund has grown to over $30 billion and paid equal yearly
      dividends to all Alaskans, including children (see figure 3.1). In effect,
      it is a giant mutual fund managed on behalf of all Alaskan citizens, present
      and future. Even after the oil runs dry, it will continue to benefit everyone.
      Economist Vernon Smith, a Nobel laureate and libertarian scholar at the
      Cato Institute, has called it &#8220;a model [that] governments all over
      the world would be well-advised to copy.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

  <blockquote>
    <p>There&#8217;s nothing about property rights, however, that requires them
      to be concentrated in profit-maximizing hands. You could, for example,
      set up a trust to own a forest, or certain forest rights, on behalf of
      future generations. These property rights would talk as loudly as shares
      of Pacific Lumber stock, but their purpose would be very different: to
      preserve the forest rather than to exploit it. If the Lorax had owned some
      of these rights, Dr. Seuss&#8217;s tale (and Pacific Lumber&#8217;s) would
      have ended more happily.</p>
    <p>Imagine a whole set of property rights like this. Let&#8217;s call them,
      generically, <strong>common property rights</strong>. If such property
      rights didn&#8217;t exist, there&#8217;d be a strong case for inventing
      them. Fortunately, they do exist in a variety of forms &#8212; for example,
      land or easements held in perpetual trust, as by the Nature Conservancy,
      and corporate assets managed on behalf of a broad community, as by the
      Alaska Permanent Fund.</p>
    <p>Some forms of common property include individual shares &#8212; again,
      the <strong>Alaska Permanent Fund</strong> is an example. These individual shares, however,
      differ from shares in private corporations. They&#8217;re not securities
      you can trade in a market; rather, they depend on your membership in the
      community. If you emigrate or die, you lose your share. Conversely, when
      you&#8217;re born into the community, your share is a birthright.</p>
    <p>I recognize that, for some, turning common wealth into any kind of property
      is a sacrilege. As Chief Seattle of the Suquamish tribe put it, &#8220;How
      can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land?&#8221; I empathize
      deeply with this sentiment. However, I&#8217;ve come to believe that it&#8217;s
      more disrespectful of the sky to pollute it without limit or payment than
      to turn it into common property held in trust for future generations. Hence,
      I favor <strong>propertization</strong>, but not privatization. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    <p>Dividends from Common Assets</p>
    <p>A cushion of reliable income is a wonderful thing. It can be saved for
      rainy days or used to pursue happiness on sunny days. It can encourage
      people to take risks, care for friends and relatives, or volunteer for
      community service. For low-income families, it can pay for basic necessities.</p>
    <p>Conversely, the absence of reliable income is a terrible thing. It heightens
      anxiety and fear. It diminishes our ability to cope with crises and transitions.
      It traps many families on the knife&#8217;s edge of poverty, and makes
      it harder for the poor to rise.</p>
    <p>So why don&#8217;t we, as <em>Monopoly</em> does, pay everyone some regular income &#8212; not
      through redistribution of income, but through predistribution of common
      property? One state &#8212; Alaska &#8212; already does this. As noted
      earlier, the Alaska Permanent Fund uses revenue from state oil leases to
      invest in stocks, bonds, and similar assets, and from those investments
      pays yearly dividends to every resident. Alaska&#8217;s model can be extended
      to any state or nation, whether or not they have oil. We could, for instance,
      have an American Permanent Fund that pays equal dividends to long-term
      residents of all 50 states. The reason is, we jointly own many valuable
      assets.</p>
    <p>Recall our discussion about common property trusts. These trusts could
      crank down pollution and earn money from selling ever-scarcer pollution
      permits. The scarcer the permits get, the higher their prices would go.
      Less pollution would equal more revenue. Over time, trillions of dollars
      could flow into an American Permanent Fund.</p>
    <p>What could we do with that common income? In Alaska the deal with oil
      revenue is 75 percent to government and 25 percent to citizens. For an
      American Permanent Fund, I&#8217;d favor a 50/50 split, because paying
      dividends to citizens is so important. Also, when scarce ecosystems are
      priced above zero, the cost of living will go up and people will need compensation;
      this wasn&#8217;t, and isn&#8217;t, the case in Alaska. I&#8217;d also
      favor earmarking the government&#8217;s dollars for specific public goods,
      rather than tossing them into the general treasury. This not only ensures
      identifiable public benefits; it also creates constituencies who&#8217;ll
      defend the revenue sharing system.</p>
    <p>Waste absorption isn&#8217;t the only common resource an American Permanent
      Fund could tap. Consider also, the substantial contribution society makes
      to stock market values. As noted earlier, private corporations can inflate
      their value dramatically by selling shares on a regulated stock exchange.
      The extra value derives from the enlarged market of investors who can now
      buy the corporation&#8217;s shares. Given a total stock market valuation
      of about $15 trillion, this socially created liquidity premium is worth
      roughly $5 trillion.</p>
    <p>At the moment, this $5 trillion gift flows mostly to the 5 percent of
      the population that own more than half the private wealth. But if we wanted
      to, we could spread it around. We could do that by charging corporations
      for using the public trading system, just as investment bankers do. (For
      those of you who haven&#8217;t been involved in a public stock offering,
      investment bankers are like fancy doormen to a free palace. While the public
      charges almost nothing to use the capital markets, investment bankers exact
      hefty fees.)</p>
    <p>The public&#8217;s fee could be in cash or stock. Let&#8217;s say we required
      publicly traded companies to deposit 1 percent of their shares each year
      in the American Permanent Fund for ten years &#8212; reaching a total of
      10 percent of their shares. This would be our price not just for using
      a regulated stock exchange, but also for all the other privileges (limited
      liability, perpetual life, copyrights and patents, and so on) that we currently
      bestow on private corporations for free.</p>
    <p>In due time, the American Permanent Fund would have a diversified portfolio
      worth several trillion dollars. Like its Alaskan counterpart, it would
      pay equal yearly dividends to everyone. As the stock market rose and fell,
      so would everyone&#8217;s dividend checks. A rising tide would lift all
      boats. America would truly be an &#8220;ownership society.&#8221; ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

      3.0 &#8212; Chapter 10: What You Can Do (pages 155-166)</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To build Capitalism 3.0, we each have unique roles to play. I therefore
      address the final pages of this book to a variety of people whose participation
      is critical. ...<br>
      POLITICIANS</p>
    <p>Everyone wants your attention. Channel 5 is on line 3 and a powerful lobbyist
      is at your door. It&#8217;s hard for you to see the forest for the trees.
      What can I possibly tell you?</p>
    <p>What I want to tell you is, there&#8217;s a fork in the road. On one side
      lies capitalism as we know it; on the other, an upgrade. You must decide
      which branch to take. Your choice has vast ramifications. Very possibly,
      the fate of the planet is in your hands. Trillions of dollars are also
      at stake. I want you to be courageous. I want you to choose the upgrade.</p>
    <p>But that isn&#8217;t what one says to a politician. What one says is,
      we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, create jobs in America,
      and protect the environment. All those things cost money, and government
      doesn&#8217;t have enough. But here&#8217;s what government can do.</p>
    </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>  First, delegate to an independent authority &#8212; something like
          the Fed &#8212; the power to cap U.S. carbon consumption. That way,
          when energy prices go up (which they inevitably will), you won&#8217;t
          get blamed. Also, make sure the carbon authority pays dividends, like
          the
          Alaska Permanent
          Fund. Then, when checks are mailed to your constituents, you can take
        credit.</li>
    <li> Second, talk about jobs and energy independence in your speeches.
            And push for an American Permanent Fund financed by sales of pollution
            permits. Within
        a few years, thousands of people in your district will be installing
        new energy systems and cashing dividend checks. You&#8217;ll be a hero.</li>
    <li> Finally, tell your donors not to worry. You&#8217;re a low-tax, small-government,
          pay-as-we-go kind of person. You think the environment should be protected
          through market mechanisms. You favor an ownership society in which every
          American has a tax-deferred savings account and no child is left behind.
          ...</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
        <p>What&#8217;s particularly nice about Capitalism 3.0 is that we can install
          it one piece at a time. We needn&#8217;t shut the machine down, or delete
          the old operating system, before installing the new one. Indeed, we&#8217;re
          not even replacing most of the old operating system, which is fine as it
          is. Rather, we&#8217;re attaching add-ons, or plug-ins, that allow for
        a gradual and safe transition. A formula for describing this is:</p>
        <p align="center">Corporations + Commons = Capitalism 3.0</p>
        <p>Like the governor of James Watt&#8217;s steam engine, these add-ons will
          curb our current engine&#8217;s unchecked excesses. When illth of one sort
          gets too great, the new bits of code will turn the illth valve down, or
          give authority to trustworthy humans to do so. If money circulates too
          unequally, the new code will alter the circulation, not by re distributing
          income but by pre distributing property. It will make similar adjustments
          when there&#8217;s too much corporate distortion of culture, communities,
        or democracy itself.</p>
        <p>What&#8217;s also nice about the new operating system is that, once installed,
          it can&#8217;t be easily removed. That&#8217;s because it relies on property
          rights rather than government programs that are subject to political ebb
          and flow. If you have any doubt about this, consider the staying power
          of Social Security and the Alaska Permanent Fund, both of which distribute
          periodic payments that have attained the status of property rights. Social
          Security is over seventy years old and has never been cut once; in 2005,
          it survived a privatization campaign led by President Bush. Similarly,
          the Alaska Permanent Fund, now more than twenty-five years old, repelled
          an attempt in 1999 to divert part of its income to the state treasury.
        ...</p>
        <p>And, for businesspeople, here&#8217;s the best part: Capitalism 3.0 will
          preserve the driving force of American capitalism, the profit-maximizing
          algorithm. It will do this not only by leaving the algorithm alone, but
          also by giving all Americans, via the American Permanent Fund, a financial
          stake in its success. All Americans will benefit both from nature&#8217;s
          health and from the health of corporations. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
