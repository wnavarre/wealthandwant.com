    (1889 speech)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The story goes on to describe how
the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Really, if we could imagine it, it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven?</span> </small></p>

think of the kingdom

condition, but of equality in opportunity. And no one can think of it
without seeing that a very kingdom of God might be brought on this
earth if people would but seek to do justice &#8212; if people would
but acknowledge the essential principle of Christianity, that of
doing to others as we would have others do to us, and of recognising
that we are all here equally the children of the one Father, equally

<br>
<small>There thus arises, anterior to human law, and deriving its
validity from the law of God, a right of private ownership in things
produced by labor &#8211; a right that the possessor may transfer, but of
which to deprive him without his will is theft.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This right of property, originating in the right of the
individual to himself, is the only full and complete right of property.
It attaches to things produced by labor, but cannot attach to things
created by God.</small></div>

  <li><small>Or, if he set up a windmill, he acquires a right of

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Perhaps this would be a good
place to interject that when
economists speak of "land", they are talking about nature. The term
embraces not only space on the earth's surface but also natural
resources -- oil in the ground, virgin timber, wildlife, the oceans
and other natural bodies of water, the airwaves, airspace, etc. To
capture for the public the value of these natural goods, land-value
charges may in some cases need to be supplanted by or combined with
other methods such as severance taxes and auctioning of leases. But
the principle is the same. <a href="../docs/Andelson_HGRC.html"><span

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Applications
of Land Value Taxation to Problems of
Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth </a><b><a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html"><br>
</a></b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The first problem of
environmental protection is management of
the harm that is caused to nearby areas by the discharge of
pollutants into air and water.</b> In the U.S. this problem is often
managed by quantitative controls. Historic polluters are allowed to
continue to pollute at reduced levels, and potential new polluters
are restricted even further or prevented from polluting entirely.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A system of quantitative controls
can be efficient if the overall
level of control is appropriate and permission to pollute is
completely transferable. But these conditions are rarely met. It is
particularly difficult to know the optimal level of pollution control
when the costs of pollution are continuous, upward sloping and not
catastrophic. And systems of quantitative controls almost always lack
fairness. They grant permanent privileges to those who have a history
of having caused harm. If a system of quantitative controls provided
that pollution rights would be auctioned, and all the proceeds would
be collected publicly, then it would be in accord with a principle
that all persons have equal rights to natural opportunities. But
there would still be the difficulty of determining the right number
of permits to sell.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A system of managing the harm from
pollution is most likely to be
both efficient and fair if it is conceived in terms of taking account
of effects of pollution on land values. Pollution can also affect the
value of structures, but these effects are harder to quantify,
because they operate somewhat differently on each structure.
Furthermore, pollution can raise as well as lower the value of
structures. An old structure that would be ready to be demolished in
a clean environment can have continuing economic value in a polluted
environment. Pollution can also have effects on the utility of
individuals apart from its effects on the value of land and
structures. If person A is harmed by pollution more than person B,
who would move in if person A moved out, but person A does not move
because of the costs of moving, then the difference between the costs
of pollution to persons A and B is a pollution cost that is not
reflected in the value of land and structures. Nevertheless,
measuring the cost of pollution by its effects on land values is a
good first approximation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To manage pollution efficiently
and fairly, one would estimate the
effects on land values of various levels of pollution and derive a
"supply schedule" of pollution based on the marginal cost of
pollution at different levels of pollution. One would then ask
polluters how much polluting they would want to do at different
prices of pollution. As long as there were more than a handful of
polluters, their incentives to report anything other than their true
marginal valuations of pollution rights would be inconsequentially
small. Thus one could aggregate the responses into an aggregate
demand schedule for pollution rights and use the intersection of the
supply and demand schedules to determine simultaneously the efficient
quantity of pollution and the price that would achieve the efficient
quantity. The payments that individuals made could be construed as
payments for appropriating for themselves land rent that was
everyone's common heritage.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Pollution sometimes crosses
international borders, as when sulfur
dioxide from coal-fired electricity generating plants in the U.S.
Midwest crosses into Canada. While there are unresolved scientific
issues regarding the amount of harm that such international pollution
causes, the economic question of what should be done when the
magnitude of damage is know is straightforward. When one country
sends pollution to another, the resulting decrease in the value of
land in the second country represents an increase in the proportion
of natural opportunities that the first country is appropriating. The
polluting nation owes corresponding compensation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Without a theory of equal
rights to natural opportunities, one
could argue that international pollution could be controlled just as
well by identifying the optimal quantity and limiting emissions to
that level. A theory of equal rights to natural opportunities does
not permit such privilege for polluters. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the area affected by a
pollutant is very large, as with the
gasses that exacerbate the ozone hole, measuring damage by changes in
land values becomes less attractive. Changes in land value are a
suitable measure of damages when the choices that people make between
land that is affected and unaffected permit the market to reflect the
damages. But if all of Australia is affected by the ozone hole, then
the damage that the ozone hole does to Australia would be measured by
land values only if it affected migration between Australia and the
rest of the world. Such effects happen slowly, and their consequences
for land values are difficult if not impossible to measure. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Nevertheless, one can apply the
principle that natural
opportunities are everyone's common heritage. No one has a right to a
disproportionate share of the opportunity to emit the gasses that
increase the ozone hole. We should seek to identify the marginal cost
schedule of emissions of these gasses, and charge a fee that equate
the marginal cost and marginal benefit of emissions. All persons in
the world should share equally in the proceeds of such fees, after
nations such as Australia that bear a disproportionate burden have
been compensated for their costs.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With CO2 and other greenhouse
gasses, the issue is yet different.
Particularly cold areas may benefit from the global warming caused by
greenhouse gasses, and no area of planet is immune from the effects
of global warming. Still, the principle of equal rights to natural
opportunities can be applied. All people have equal rights to emit
greenhouse gasses. People have different ideas about what the right
level is. The appropriate way to give expression to the idea that we
all have equal rights to the environment is to use a structured
democratic and market process.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider CO2. Start by having
every nation propose a quantity of
permitted emissions of CO2 per capita. Weight each nation's proposal
by its population, and take the weighted median of the proposals.
That is an initial entitlement that represents a majority rule
equilibrium, a reasonable expression of equal rights for all. Unlike
the current global climate negotiations, in this entitlement no
preference is given to nations of the basis of their having a history
of high emissions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, ask each nation how much
money it would be willing to pay
for reductions in global emissions below the entitlement levels, and
how much money it would regard as adequate compensation for emissions
above the initial entitlement level. (These question presume that
nations want lower emissions. If a nation desires extra global
warming, the questions would be reversed.) </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To motivate nations to respond
honestly to these questions, the
"demand-revealing" process would be used to charge nations for their
answers. That is, each nation would pay for the cost that it imposed
on other nations (or receive the benefit that it provided to other
nations) by having the preferences that it had instead of the average
of the preferences of other nations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The next step is to ask each
nation for an offer schedule of how
much it is willing to pay for the right to emit CO2 in excess of its
allocation, or how much it would regard as adequate compensation for
emitting less than its allocation. The (vertical) sum of the answers
to the questions about the costs that nations would experience from
emissions provides a "supply schedule" of emission rights. The
(horizontal) sum of the answers to the question of how much nations
would pay to emit more (or accept as compensation for emitting less)
provides a demand schedule for emission rights. The intersection of
the two schedules specifies the efficient level of emissions and the
price that will induce nations to emit the efficient amount of CO2.
This is the price to be paid by nations that want to emit more than
their entitlements, and received by nations that want to emit less
than their entitlements. In addition, all nations pay or receive
something for the net cost to other nations for their having
preferences that deviate from the average of the preferences of
others. These payments ensure that nations are motivated to report
their costs of emissions truthfully. </small><small><b>... </b><span

<a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Williams_Intermediate_Kit.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George laid down the
principles of sane environmental policies
half a century before the world's attention began to focus on the
natural environment. To paraphrase his deep and far-reaching
environmental philosophy: "The use of Earth's scarce natural resources
should be strictly and equitably rationed by a system of resource
rentals."</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMICS VS.
GEONOMICS</span></small><br>
<small>Due to the current dominance of neoclassical economics, the
environment
has been so recklessly plundered largely because of the blurred
distinction between private property and that of our natural
environment, the Global Commons. Put simply, private property is that
which is created by labour, whereas the Global Commons is that which is
provided by nature. They require totally different economic treatments.
We assert that the gifts of Nature should not be treated as mere
commodities, to be bought, sold, speculated upon and abused for
profiteering!</small><br>
<br>
<small>Geonomics removes taxes from wages and other private property
and
increases taxes and user fees on common property. Reducing taxes on
labour increases purchasing capacity, and reducing taxes on capital
encourages efficiency. Shifting taxes on to land and natural resources
curbs speculation and private profiteering in our common property, and
clearly is a practical way of conserving and fairly sharing the Global
Commons. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT, as we've seen, strongly encourages land to be put to its
optimum
use as an occupant must pay the full LVT whether the land is being
fully utilised or not. Land speculation, whereby a speculator or
"developer" can simply sit on a large parcel of land and wait for
population and infrastructure to build up its value, would become
unprofitable. Parks and well-used public spaces would certainly remain,
but not underused tracts of land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In
other words, LVT is a recipe for the reining in of urban sprawl.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The resultant compact, less wasteful urban landscape will have a
multitude of environmental mega-benefits. Extensive public transport
will become feasible in a smaller area, as will cycling and walking.
And we have already seen how public investment in fields such as public
transport will become affordable when increased land values are
"recycled" or recovered through LVT. Furthermore, a compact Geonomic
cityscape won't require the enormous consumption of resources as when
roads, pipelines and other infrastructure have to bypass kilometres of
unused and underused land to reach the outer limits of the suburban
sprawl. Remember, too, the environmental costs of long and wasteful
commuting journeys from distant suburbs.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Cities won't sprawl over valuable farmland, and marginal
farmland won't
sprawl over what should be national parks or wilderness. With
agricultural land, there's a technical adjustment of LVT whereby the
basis of assessment is on the maximum sustainable yield, strongly
encouraging organic farming practices. In some circumstances, there's
also a good case for the requirement of what's called an Ecology
Security Deposit and/or restoration insurance from farmers.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Geonomics is firmly in agreement with those environmental groups
which
call for the elimination of subsidies in areas which are
environmentally or socially harmful, unnecessary, or inequitable in
such areas as:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>resource extraction</small></li>
  <li><small>non-sustainable energy production</small></li>
  <li><small>commerce and industry</small></li>
  <li><small>forestry and non-sustainable agriculture</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsidies are, essentially,
negative taxes - and in these instances (above) they are having the
opposite effect to green taxes! </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">MONITOR THE PLANET, NOT THE
PEOPLE!</span></small><br>
<small>Remember too that LVT eliminates the government surveillance
over
people, their activities and their assets. What LVT and other
conventional eco-taxes does do is to monitor Our One Earth as any
responsible form of stewardship should, ensuring our scarce natural
resources are not polluted, wasted, undersold or privately
misappropriated.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The bottom line of our present economic system is that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">not everything which counts (our Earth) can
be counted (in $ terms), and not everything that can be counted
("progress") counts.</span>
Presently, it's the market which determines the "worth" of, say, our
water resources, our genetic integrity or the last remaining habitat of
an endangered species. The only moderating factor to this is the blunt
instrument of occasional government intervention, when public outcry
forces it to save what's left of our (and future generations') Global
Commons.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But there is a means of determining the worth of all of these
intangible benefits - patches of the Global Commons which confer
aesthetic, recreational, life-enhancing, spiritual, climate-preserving,
biodiversity-saving benefits.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">VALUING THE INVALUABLE</span></small><br>
<small>To summarise an intricate but elegant principle and process, the
LVT
assessment process used to determine the rent payable on residential,
industrial and agricultural land can - and must - be adapted to
relatively-untouched areas of the Global Commons facing commercial
exploitation. The assessors attempt to factor in all these less
tangible benefits of a natural resource into their valuation of its
worth to the community and to posterity. As always, these assessments
are open for public scrutiny and comment. In the end, only if a
prospective developer is prepared to pay the full cost of utilising
this resource will such extraction or development go ahead, taking into
account the proposed environmental restoration. So a beautiful patch of
rainforest might well be lost, but only if its commercial value is
extremely high (e.g. because it's sitting on top of a huge lode of
platinum).</small><br>
<br>
<small>But will local residents will lose out? Not really, because the
loss of
this local amenity will, of course, be taken into account in the next
LVT assessment. And the huge resource rentals payable for this
commercial extraction will go into their rightful place - the community
coffers.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHERE A GUESS IS BETTER THAN
NONE AT ALL!</span></small><br>
<small>But how does anybody - professional assessor or not - possibly
put a
value on something so hard-to-value as water quality or biodiversity or
recreational use? The answer is that the valuation can't be an
accounting-style series of clear calculations, but a series of value
judgments that are, in the end, quantified. It's a guess, but the best
possible guess. And the best possible guess is better than a wild
guess. And a wild guess is better than no guess at all. And no guess at
all is pretty much what we have at the moment, as the outcome of our
present neoclassical system is that such natural benefits are often
rated as next-to-worthless, and almost given away!&nbsp; ... <span

<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synopsis</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Land value taxation
(LVT)
has often been omitted from the lists of natural resources for which
eco-taxes are being advocated. LVT provides strong financial
encouragement for land to be put to its optimal use and will eliminate
speculation on land, as occupants must pay the full LVT whether the
land is being fully utilised or not. This leads to better land
management, a reduction in urban sprawl, less urban smothering of
agricultural land, and less farmland being pushed into hinterland.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">LVT makes the investment in
resource-efficient infrastructure affordable because the resulting
enhanced land values are "recycled" back into public coffers. </span>One
particular application of LVT to agricultural land provides much-needed
financial incentives for organic farming. Unlike other ecotaxes which
"sow the seeds of their own revenue demise," LVT actuallyincreases over
time as our environment is enhanced and is thus a stable revenue base. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This paper argues
that the LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from
monitoring human activity onto our use and abuse of natural resources,
as any responsible form of stewardship should. It suggests that only if
land users are prepared to pay the full cost of utilising resources
should private resource holding be permitted.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"The depletion of natural
resources and
the despoliation of nature is due to a single reason: the failure
properly to measure the rental value of all of nature's resources, and
to make the users pay the community for the benefits they receive." F.
Harrison, "The Corruption of Economics"&nbsp;<strong> ....</strong></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>... <span style="font-weight: bold;">It should also be noted
that the
advantages of LVT extend far beyond the immediate and direct
contribution to environmental solutions - they give rise to economic
efficiency, social justice, individual liberty, world peace, effective
third world aid and more.</span> An understanding of the nature of
economic rent and rent-seeking behaviour would assist the appreciation
of some points made here, but an explanation of this extends beyond the
immediate ambit of this paper. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This

<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"For the failure to make people
pay
rent for access, or possession of, natural resources is at the heart of
all major environmental problems, and is the cause of some of the most
fractious geo-political problems .... <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">There
are no remedies for the ecocrises that do not include a heightened
awareness of the value of economic rent and the process of the land
market"</span>...<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">While taxes on labour and
capital act as a deterrent to production and employment, the unique
qualities of land are such that a tax on land values encourages land to
be put to its optimal use. Simply put, land holders cannot afford to
hold land unused or underused, for they are compelled to pay the full
LVT whether they use this scarce resource or not. </span>The resulting
<span style="font-weight: bold;">compact cityscape</span>
would consume far less resources (in terms of land, infrastructure and
ongoing energy costs) and would be more amenable to the provision of
public transport, walking and riding. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The whole field of eco-taxes cannot be viewed in isolation of
the
fiscal imperatives to raise sufficient public finance, and here we see
another of the virtues of LVT. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">If
people were required to pay the rental value of most natural resources
they used (as many, in fact, already do - to private owners) an
adjustment in patterns of consumption would follow. The environmental
goals would be achieved - at the cost of fiscal goals.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>However, under our present fiscal regime, governments are locked
into a
dependency on revenue from socially-harmful sources such as tobacco and
gambling, and cannot raise the taxes on them to levels that would "kill
the golden goose". Would such political realities change with
eco-taxes? Because of the inherent problem with most eco-taxes that
they reduce consumption of natural resources and therefore the tax
base, they give rise to a financial inducement to hold the tax rate at
a low enough rate so that a degree of pollution and wasteful
consumption can continue.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The effects of conventional eco-taxes sharply contrast with LVT
which instead is a <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">renewable
and naturally-escalating source of revenue</span>
which arises when people are willing to pay for the use of land the
value of which is enhanced by natural resources which sustain healthy
lives. In other words, the success of a cleaner and more secure
environment would feed through to the land market, which measures the
attraction of the natural environment for living and working. Because
people are willing to pay higher rents for such benefits LVT, instead
of eroding revenue, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">expands the public's
revenue base so that everybody enjoys the benefits of cleaning up and
conserving the natural environment.</span> Under the current system of
land tenure, the financial benefits of a cleaner environment accrue to
landowners.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Here, for this conference, is the quirk - <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">environmental
considerations played almost no part in the compelling endorsements
lavished on LVT! The main bill, then and now, is its powerful
explanation of the great causes of social injustice, with the second
billing going to an exposure of a whole range of economic
inefficiencies and deadweight losses of our present economic system,
which should more accurately be termed land-monopoly capitalism.</span>
Support acts include libertarian ideals (non-intrusive tax systems),
effective Third World Aid, an end to tax evasion, contributions to
world peace, and an end to boom &amp; bust cycles.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The appeal of LVT to some others is more its philosophical basis
and
how its implementation must turn the economy the right way up, such
that the cause of the "madness" (because completely unnecessary) of
involuntary unemployment is eliminated, which of necessity then leads
to the range of benefits just mentioned.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This is not a meandering departure from the subject of this
conference.
No significant, effectual solutions can be made to our environment if
the all-embracing economic system is only nibbled at, piecemeal, from
the angle of taxation alone.</small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT is not a mere taxation solution, but an integrated economic
solution, impacting on land management and cutting at the heart of
privilege and injustice. Yes, environmental tax reformers must indeed
address the looting of undervalued natural resources driven by
bourgeois habits of overconsumption. Let us not, however, overlook the
destruction resulting from short-term perspectives driven by poverty
and desperation. LVT deals with both worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

 href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
The most compelling arguments to many supporters stem from its
environmental consequences. A tax on land sites is the most powerful
instrument available to neutralize and reverse the centrifugal forces
of urban sprawl. This is because incentives are present &#8212; the higher
the tax the more power it has &#8212; to improve the high-value sites to the
full extent that their market value warrants. Titleholders are induced
to build on their parcels in order to recover the carrying costs of
their increased taxes. The inelastic supply of land sites means that
taxes are shouldered fully by owners, without being passed on to
tenants. (Of course a tenant&#8217;s charges can be raised anytime.) Hence
urban areas tend to be improved and peripheral areas become less
attractive to sprawl development. George saw a strong moral argument
for shifting from the conventional property tax levied on both land and
improvements to one based on land alone. The argument was quite simple:
the tax as it stood penalized people who improved their property and
rewarded people who held vacant parcels for speculative gain. It
rewarded those owners who let their holdings go to wrack and ruin,
often those who bought up parcels to use as rental property without
investing in the maintenance to ensure that they would continue to be
attractive and livable &#8212; slumlords. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>The focus of Henry George&#8217;s inquiry, and of his disciples, is
the
pursuit of justice. Economic justice is an agenda which ecological
economists also subscribe to, even though their immediate focus is
concern about the earth&#8217;s survival at all, let alone the distribution
of its fruits. Here, however, is where the Georgist tradition is able
to contribute most to the environmental justice program. There is a
broad appreciation, particularly among ecological economists that have
worked in poorer nations, that natural resources are endangered every
bit as much by the scarcity of basic necessities as by overpopulation.
Urban elites usurp high value lands and retain land rents growing out
of their production; poor people are marginalized and left to fend for
themselves. They often survive by taking what little environmental
resources are left on ravaged land sites, further reducing the
resiliency of these local ecologies. Collection and redistribution of
land rents, either in the form of public services or in the form of a
citizens&#8217; dividends, offers a way to restore equity without
redistribution of land titles and without all the dislocations this
might entail. Many third world leaders at the present time see
solutions to poverty and economic inequality in the redistribution of
land titles. Georgists argue that this is not necessary; all that is
necessary is to recover the land rent and assure its equitable
distribution to rightful claimants.&nbsp; ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>We do an awful lot of driving just to do what we need to do. This is because
      transportation engineers and land use planners have confused two fundamental
      concepts: access and mobility.</p>
  <p>By confusing these two principles, we spend an inordinate amount of money
      on transportation services, most of it on roads and highways. One 1993 study
      calculated that the total costs of motor vehicle transportation to our society
      equal approximately a fourth of our gross domestic product (GDP).<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> The
      study concluded that &quot;when the full range of costs of transportation
      are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the American public
      a total
      of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. Just the costs of automobile crashes
      represents a figure equal to 8 percent of the American GDP.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4]</em></strong></font> Japan,
      by way of comparison, spends an estimated 10.4 percent to satisfy all its transportation
      requirements, although the figure might be a bit low because not all externalities
      are included in the calculation.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5] </em></strong></font>Road
      user fees in 1991 totaled only about $33 billion, whereas the true costs to
      society were ten times that;<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> put
      another way, drivers pay only 10 percent of the true costs of their motor vehicle
      use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[7] </em></strong></font>The balance is paid
      by society, effectively subsidizing highway use by paying for all but the marginal
      out-of-pocket operating costs. ...</p>
  <p>Such are the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten miles. If
      the urban resident has to rely on a car nonetheless, subtracting some $3,000
      annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again that much (and likely
      more) to own a car. Author James Kunstler put the true costs along with other
      experts at about $6,100 annually seven years ago.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9]</em></strong></font> The
      American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000 miles in
      2001 cost 51 cents per mile, or $7,650.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[10]</em></strong></font> This
      figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not the additional costs passed
      on to society.</p>
  <p>The latter figures include externalities such as pollution and the costs of
      highway crashes. Hortatory public pleas for people to tune up their engines
      so that they pollute less, to inflate tires properly, and to drive more safely
      are not likely to change the reality that people are forgetful and fallible.
      Pollution-free cars are not available; people must drive to participate in
      this society. The consequences of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and ozone
      are no longer a matter of debate; they are scientific fact. Despite frequent
      headlines about replacing the internal combustion engine, all the realistic
      substitutes also ultimately rely on fossil fuel power, solar-powered cars are
      far in the future, if at all, and also fail to deal with any transition. And
      every person driving his or her own car multiplies the probabilities of accidents.
      When people step into a car, they are seldom mindful of such odds. Yet if the
      direct pecuniary costs of driving increase in any substantial way, there will
      surely be significant changes in the trade-offs involved in housing/transportation
      choices. As will be made clear later, making costs visible and linking them
      to private personal behavior is one way to ensure that transportation pays
      its own way. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE CASE OF FORESTRY</span> </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The inadequacy of surrogate
pollution taxation is
exemplified by forestry.&nbsp; The main purposes of watershed
protection have long been to regulate water flows, to reduce flooding
and erosion, and sustain flows during droughts.&nbsp;</span> Minimizing
pesticide runoff is a worthy additional purpose, but not the sole
one.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Francisco Goya left hanging in The Prado two
paintings of his beloved, La Maja Desnuda and La Maja Vestida.&nbsp;
Some prefer the earthy Desnuda.&nbsp; When it comes to Mother Earth,
however, she looks better Vestida in virgin verdure or some renewable
replacement raiments.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gaia
theorists, indeed, regard the
biosphere as an integral part of the whole terrestrial organism.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">However you regard it, removing
it is hazardous and
damaging to the children of Earth.&nbsp; Denuded land is the source of
almost all forest runoff problems.&nbsp;</span> Erosion results from a
combination of </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>logging roads (too many, too long, on land too steep); 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>clearcutting; and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>slow replanting.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Slow replanting is the central
problem.&nbsp; It
slows the supply of second-growth timber, and thus creates pressure to
invade submarginal areas.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Foresters
should harvest the low, flat,
warm lands early and often because: </span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>a) Regeneration is economical
there, it pays for itself where trees grow fast; <br>
b) Regeneration is
fastest there, minimizing the exposure period of bare land; <br>
c) Logging
roads may be shorter and less erosive there, because nearer to markets
and on level land; <br>
d) The temporary loss of scenic beauty is less
severe; <br>
e) The exposed bare land is less steep; <br>
f) Logging is cheaper
and less destructive; selective logging is more feasible; <br>
g) Fire
control is easier; <br>
h) Younger stands are more vigorous and naturally
resistant to pests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The last point bears underscoring here.&nbsp; It
points to how good forest management can minimize pest damage without
heavy reliance on toxics.&nbsp; The spruce budworm, for example, wreaks
damage mainly on trees weakened by age.&nbsp; To protect those older
trees, whole forests, millions of acres in the northeast are sprayed,
with tragic treadmill results.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>The tussock&#8209;moth, over which so much organochlorine
has been shed in the fir forests, damages trees mainly on poor growing
sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Trees on good
sites withstand defoliation, green up,
and grow with renewed vigor.&nbsp; The moral: stay off the poor
sites.&nbsp; The method: utilize the good sites fully.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why
aren't the good sites harvested early, replanted
quickly, and utilized fully?&nbsp; One major reason lies in the tax
system.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>a.&nbsp; Replanting cost is not
expensable for
income tax, it must be capitalized, hence not written off until decades
later when timber is harvested.&nbsp; <strong>...
</strong></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>b.&nbsp; Most states have
substituted the yield tax
for the property tax.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>c.&nbsp; Some states have
virtually eliminated the
land value part of the property tax on timber, removing an incentive to
early reforestation.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>d.&nbsp; When timber is standing
the value added by
growth is partly unrecognized as taxable income. <strong>...</strong><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">An
optimal solution would constructively combine and
synthesize two apparently contrary concepts of land stewardship.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THESIS:
Concept A says "Conserve for the
future."&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ANTITHESIS: Concept B says
"Stewardship means
highest and best use."&nbsp;</span> Landholders are responsible to use
land
now, in order to employ others (generate incomes), to produce goods
(combat inflation), and pay taxes (avoid deficits).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SYNTHESIS: Concept AB says do both,
but in different
places.&nbsp; Use the good lands intensively, grow timber early and
often, thus relieve human pressure and help conserve the vulnerable,
erosive lands.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Until this is done, will optimal taxes on aerial
sprays do much good?&nbsp; Some good, no doubt.&nbsp; But the main
problems are deeper rooted and call for bolder measures.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>That is my basic message.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Forestry
suffers
from cutting sprawl, quite analogous to urban sprawl.&nbsp; The center
is neglected, so the action moves to submarginal fringes and damages
what's left of the center.</span>&nbsp; Let us now look at two more
cases,
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">urban
sprawl</span> itself, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">agricultural
sprawl</span>, where the source of
problems is analogous, and the implied solutions the same. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE CASE OF URBAN SETTLEMENT </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The central problem
here is urban sprawl; the
solution is compactness.</span>&nbsp; More land urbanized means more
urban
runoff.&nbsp; But more people on given land may even mean less runoff
per acre, e.g. at the threshold where sewering can economically replace
a collection of septic tanks and leach lines.&nbsp; It certainly means
less runoff per capita.&nbsp; It means better control of any given
runoff.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>A compact, synergistic city is resource-saving;
sprawl is resource-wasting, using up more land, capital, materials,
fuels, and air/water quality to substitute for direct human contacts
and cooperation.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Here are some
items that sprawl maximizes or
worsens: </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the number of car-miles for any given level of
urban linkage, with smog generated in proportion.&nbsp; (The
unforgettable demonstration of the last came in 1967 when Mayor Henry
Maier closed all Milwaukee gas stations for a week, because of arson
and riot threats.&nbsp; As a by&#8209;product Milwaukeeans saw, for the first
and last times, what clean air really looks like &#8212; glorious!) &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>paved areas, with salt and roadside litter both
spread in proportion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>"and sudden death."&nbsp; Auto accidents, the
ultimate "negative externality," kill some 40,000 Americans per year,
maim many times more, and intimidate everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>grading and denuding new lands, generally
upstream and more sloping.&nbsp; Three-quarters of the pollutant
loadings in the Menominee River come from urban non-point
sources.&nbsp; Developing urban areas cover only 2.6% of the watershed,
but contribute 37% of the suspended solids and 48% of the
phosphorous.&nbsp; (Bauman et al. 1980, cited in Falk, 1985, p.
P-II-B-2) </small></li>
  <li><small>number of homes on septic tanks. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>diversion of sewer funds from treating sewage to
collecting it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>larger lots and lawns, longer driveways. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>inhabited areas without good fire protection,
with more grass and brush exposed to humans. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>private wells puncturing aquifer caps. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>settlement and industry beyond gutters and storm
drains. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>withering of mass transit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>longer, wider utility rights-of-way, with higher
voltage and pressure and hazard. &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>filling wetlands </small></li>
  <li><small>occupying floodplains, so more flood control
reservoirs are needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>automobile dependency creates its own treadmill
effect.&nbsp; The car itself is the major consumer of urban space,
space which must in turn be traversed, using still more
car-miles.&nbsp; Pedestrians and cyclers are maimed and intimidated
into becoming motorists.&nbsp; Mass transit withers away.&nbsp; The
market does not lead us to optimal outcomes in such a world &#8212; this
world.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suburbs abate their own problems
by pick-pocketing
central cities, e.g. by getting sewers they could not pay for
themselves.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solutions to urban
sprawl will involve at least
these three courses:</span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>a) Marginal-cost pricing of city
services, with a spatial or locational component.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong> <br>
b) Renewal-oriented tax policy,
especially in central cities.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong><br>
c) Renewal-oriented spending and
service policy.<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE CASE OF AGRICULTURE</span> </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Farming manifests the
same problem as forests and
cities.&nbsp; Public policy suppresses full use of the best lands while
subsidizing use and abuse of marginal lands.&nbsp; As we said of urban
sprawl, the more land in use, the more runoff.&nbsp; Here are some
elements that cause "agricultural sprawl.</span>"&nbsp; </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>a) Urban sprawl takes the best
land out
of farming.&nbsp; <strong>...
</strong></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>b) Land retirement programs
...&nbsp; put good land on ice to support prices.&nbsp;<strong> ...
</strong></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>c) Surpluses are destroyed at
home, or
dumped (sold below cost) abroad, under Federal subsidy.
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>d) Some crops associated with
high
erosion receive strong support or protection: wheat, corn, cotton and
sugarbeets, for example.
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>e) SCS funds are not allocated
by need,
but per Senator.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong><br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

assessment for installing a truly conserving device like a Harvestore

Support of
Environmentalism</a><b></b></small><font size="+1"><small><b><br>
</b></small></font></small>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On what basis shall habitat-savers
identify with median Americans?
We share a problem: we are all victims of private property rights
carried to extremes. Abraham Lincoln, the original Radical
Republican, once spoke to the effect that whenever landless people
cannot find work and shelter, then the rights of private property
have been carried too far and must be curbed. We have seen what
Gifford Pinchot said.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>"... natural resources
must be developed and preserved for the benefit of the many and not
merely for the profit of a few. ... the people shall get their fair
share of the benefit which comes from the development of the country
WHICH BELONGS TO US ALL." </i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Belongs to us all? Was Pinchot a
Communist? Not likely: he was a
Republican, an active political one, twice Governor of
Pennsylvania.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have too little time together
to develop that fully, but here
are some ideas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">First,
environmentalists might rethink what we mean
by "open space." To Pinchot, "open" meant the space had public
access. Today it often means the reverse: golf courses, duck clubs,
sacred Indian lands, private beaches, cemeteries, farmlands, vacant
speculative holdings, unpoliced parks taken over by gangs, protected
and posted habitat, water from which swimmers are excluded for power
boats, rights-of-way closed to hikers, University experimental plots,
and so on.</span> In this sense, there is more open land in downtown
Manhattan than in many of our rural and sylvan areas. Many a water
reservoir is open to beavers, ducks and geese, who routinely powder
their noses there, but not to humans who seldom do, and can be
trained not to.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get more support for habitat,
find ways to open it to people,
putting more funds and effort into behavioral controls if necessary.
In Pinchot's day, people spoke unblushingly of "character training,"
and practiced it. Pinchot himself said, "the training of our people
in citizenship is as germane to it (conservation) as the
productiveness of the earth." Wilderness clubs preached and taught
responsible behavior in the wilds. The Boy Scouts taught it, churches
taught it, schools taught it, forest rangers taught it, camp
counselors taught it, community leaders taught it: you heard it all
around, and it did help shape your character. It was a great
community effort, enlisting broad support and conviction. Then, in
that less mobile, less commercialized, more communitarian age, social
control over public behavior came naturally. We came to take it for
granted, until it silently slipped away. Today it may take more
conscious effort, but it was done then, it can be done now.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Gifford Pinchot, the father of
Conservation, was not against
developing land. In his own words:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The first principle of
conservation is development, the use of the natural resources now
existing ... for the benefit of the people who live here now. There may
be just as much waste in neglecting the development and use of certain
natural resources as there is in their destruction by waste. ...
Conservation, then, stands emphatically for the use of substitutes for
all the exhaustible natural resources, ... (water power and water
transportation are his examples). ... The development of our natural
resources and the fullest use of them for the present generation is the
first duty of this generation. <strong>... </strong></small>
  <p><small>In the second place conservation stands for the prevention
of waste. ... "</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So Pinchot was against waste, so
what? Who isn't? This could be
just a banality, but he gives it a new turn. To him, waste means
failing to use renewable resources. His example was hydropower, which
he would substitute for coal and oil. That is not such a good example
today, when we cherish our few remaining wild rivers, but today urban
land makes an even better example.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Urban land?", you may ask. "What
has urban land in common with
falling water?" Economists (who are not all bad) classify urban land
as a "flow resource." They liken it to flowing water because its
services perish with time, whether used or not, and we are trapped in
the one-way flow of time. Likewise, urban land is not depleted by
use. It is an even better example of a "flow resource" than flowing
water itself, because, as we are so conscious today, "unharnessed"
flowing water may have other downstream uses. Even in wasting out
through the Golden Gate, it may repel salinity. The unreaped harvests
of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the gates of time
like lost loves dimming, and golden moments we let slip away beyond
recall.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is this "service" of urban
land, that we should be mindful of
it? 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>For one thing, using central urban land conserves all the
hydrocarbons and other resources otherwise needed to traverse it.
Compact urban settlement is a direct substitute for oil, with all
that implies - and it implies a great deal, which I will leave you to
fill in.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, using good central land saves all the costs of
settling on
other land - including the cost of taking more of the shrinking
habitat from endangered species. ...
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span>Those
are the carrots. A good stick is also needed. We have seen
how leapfrogging results from the scattered locations of motivated
sellers. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We
can motivate sellers near-in, and in compact increments
as we expand spatially, by raising land taxes there. </span>Proposition
13
makes this difficult, but not impossible: many special assessments
have the essential motivating quality of land taxes, with a different
legal form, that exempts them from Proposition 13.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I could wax rhapsodic about the
results to expect from such
taxation, but have done so elsewhere and will leave it with a word:
visit Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Copenhagen, or Johannesburg, which
have made use of this principle to excellent effect.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These are basic issues, and call
for bold actions. Do not waste
your time on wimpish meliorism, or "Goo-goo" thinking. For
example:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is said we need a land
use inventory. We already have lots of them: people have been
classifying land for decades. The question is, what shall we do with
them? </small>
  <p><small>It is said we need "risk ratings." These are subject to
manipulation and juggling, like benefit/cost analyses of recent ill
fame. The question is, who will control the ratings, and to what ends?</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>It is said we need fire models. We have fire models; they
were already chic in 1950. The question is, how to keep scattered homes
out of fire-prone areas, where they make prescribed controlled burning
nearly impossible. The question is how to keep the State and the fire
insurance industry from cross-subsidizing these homes by averaging
their risks in with others.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rather, let us study how to
emulate the model of Butchart Gardens,
near Victoria, B.C. Butchart doesn't sound like a gardener's name,
and sure enough, Mr. Butchart was a hardrock miner who attacked the
earth and left a great ugly gash in it. Ah, but Mrs. Butchart, she
wanted space for a garden, so she made one there. She rediscovered
the truth that land is not just the matter that occupies space, it is
space, always renewable and reclaimable. Now Butchart Gardens is one
of the world's great beauty spots, drawing visitors from everywhere -
in the summertime you hear every language there. Our decayed central
cities, too, may bloom again like Mrs. Butchart's garden. Let us make
it our model.&nbsp; </small><small><small><small><b><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> Green economics.</b>
George&#8217;s paeans to compact settlement, both rural and urban, are
highly compatible with the modern need to discourage invasion of
wilderness areas, wetlands, etc. George would satisfy the demand for
land on the lands best suited for human use, leaving most of the
earth undisturbed by man. (Gaffney, 1976). <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If anything, he
understated the high capacity of good lands to meet all human needs</span>
(Gaffney, 1999). As a son of the frontier, he overstated its virtues
in some oratorical passages, anticipating Frederick J. Turner. His
pioneering work on the marginal productivity theory of wage
determination puts too much emphasis on the frontierish &#8220;margin
of cultivation,&#8221; borrowing from Ricardo. In practise, however,
George was a devoted urbanist (like Ricardo himself). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In other respects, to &#8220;green up&#8221;
Georgism we need to
free it from its exclusive focus on the virtues of a land tax levied
in the form of a property tax (Gaffney, 1998). George himself stated
his central thesis in another form: &#8220;We must make land common
property.&#8221; To him, the property tax was simply the most
convenient and practical tool to that end, one directly at hand.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, we need at least two
modifications. </small></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One is to recognize the
occasional virtues of taxes on the
extraction or withdrawal of natural resources from the earth</span>.
(Gaffney,
1967, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1998). This has become the common meaning
of &#8220;green taxes.&#8221; An obvious modern case is the withdrawal of water
from rivers and wells (Gaffney, 1992). Another obvious case is levying
effluent charges on polluters, where that is feasible (Gaffney, 1965).
This proposal harks back at least to A.C. Pigou (1928), and often bears
his name. </small>
      <p><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Obvious as may
be the virtues of such green taxes, polluters
have successfully rallied behind an alternative, the tradable pollution
permit. </span>This idea entered academia through J.H. Dales and
Ronald Coase,
who challenged the &#8220;polluter pays&#8221; principle. It entails a massive
validation of pollution, making it a kind of property right, based on
&#8220;ancient and honorable histories&#8221; of pollution. This is not the place
to skewer it as it deserves, but obviously Georgists should help put it
down. </small></p>
      <small> </small></li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> A less obvious, but more challenging case
is dealing with
&#8220;non-point&#8221; pollution.</span> Here, simple market-oriented policies are
hard
if not impossible to apply. I have to agree with a Marxist like Burkett
that some problems call for systemic changes that make us think outside
the box of the market and its logic. I have offered up a package of
such changes elsewhere (Gaffney, 1987). <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b style="font-style: italic;">TPR</b><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> - For an economics professor, you're said
to be
quite an expert on the environment, what's the connection?</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Economic
analysis, properly used, can serve the
cause of environmentalism. The neo-classical economists abused both
economics and the environment badly, as a byproduct of their drive to
discredit classical political economy, and Henry George. John Bates
Clark wrote that land is not scarce, that mankind can convert capital
into land without limit, and create as much as we please. He wrote
that natural resources have no value to mankind until and unless they
are privatized; that privatization itself is what creates value. Our
universities churn out thousands of new economists yearly, imbued
with such attitudes. When Rachel Carson kicked off the new
environmentalism in 1962 with her "<b><i>Silent Spring,</i></b>" most
economists trashed or disdained her: they 'd been trained that
way.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Faced with the obvious growth of
environmental sentiment,
economists dealt with it as they have with other problems: they
absorbed it in the discipline, then marginalized it. Now they can say
it is part of economics, while they proceed to ignore or trivia lize
it in their major policy pronouncements, wherein endless territorial
expansion continues to be not just a goal, but a necessity to make
the system work.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The legitimate goals of
environmentalists, they coopt and distort.
Here are two examples. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>They'll tell you that it's not OK to promote oil
conservation by taxing withdrawals, but it is OK to do so by
monopolizing the industry - monopolists are our best friends. </small></li>
  <li><small>They'll tell you it's not OK to check polluters by taxing
their effluents, but it is OK to give them property rights to pollute,
based on past emissions, and then buy those rights back from them at
their price. You think I'm just making that up? I wish I were! The EPA
is actually applying that idea around the country. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thank you, John B. Clark; thank
you, neo-classical economics. It
all follows from Clark's efforts to avoid any recognition that
natural resources are common property: in this case, the air itself
is turned into private property. Your very right to breathe, you have
to buy from major owners of the air. And how did they establish that
ownership? By their track records of dumping their crud in the air in
the past. It beggars belief, but there it is: it shows what the war
against Henry George has made of the discipline of economics.</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small></div>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>TPR</b> -
If Earth's ecosystem and poorest people will
be the largest beneficiaries of the reform you advocate, how will it
ever gain public acceptance in America's increasingly money-driven
political system? If the press will never acknowledge it and the
education system is so lost and blind, how can this reform ever
happen? Are Georgists like the character in 1984?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Every system
must purify itself from time to
time, or be destroyed. How long that takes depends on how strong a
base you started from, and how strong your rivals are. The USA
started from a strong base, built in part by the Progressives
(including many Georgists) and the New Dealers (in spite of some of
their destructive moves). Now, our leaders think we are riding high,
just because the stock market is rising, even though real wage rates
have fallen for 25 years, our debts are staggering, our liabilities
and contingent liabilities exceed our assets, our biggest growth
industry is building jails, our population is losing its literacy,
our major cities have decayed, and so on. Marx was right about one
thing, at least: the system carries the seeds of its own
destruction.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our leaders have done a good job
of subverting our rivals, in part
by forcing on them the ideas of neo-classical economics, the ideas
that originated as part of the anti-Georgist campaigns. Japan gave us
a good run for a while, but got suckered into aping our worst habits,

has knocked them out of the race for a while. Most of S.E. Asia has

DIVIDENDS AND OIL RESOURCE RENTS</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>CLIMATE CHANGE
AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Some environmentalists raise the
concern that citizen dividends
and social services based on petroleum and other nonrenewable
resources rents makes it that much more difficult to shift to
renewable sources of energy. Alaskan representatives frequently have
voted to open up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and other areas
for more oil drilling. This writer&sup1;s first response to this
concern is that if citizens do not get a rightful share of these
resource rents, then corporations will capture even greater amounts
of surplus profits. While this is true, we need to look at the issue
in a holistic way.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> From the vantage point of a
planetary civilization, we clearly
need to shift to renewable energy sources. There is clear and
compelling scientific evidence of of global warming. Climate change
is one of the most pressing environmental problems of our time.
Carbon dioxide and other gases released by fossil fuel consumption
and deforestation is trapping heat in our atmosphere for 100 years or
longer, with devastating environmental consequence. It is time to go
full throttle in addressing this enormous challenge.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We need to use oil resource rents
to shift to renewable energy
and sustainable economies. Both the Alaskan and Norwegian petroleum
funds invest in stocks, bonds and real estate. Interest from these
investments are distributed as citizen dividends in Alaska and for
social services Norway. The priorities of the fund portfolios need to
be scrutinized and revamped. Currently the investment portfolios are
mandated to follow the &sup3;prudent investor rule&sup2; meaning that
managers must find the balance point between highest profits and
lowest risks. Fund investments are not based on or screened for
socially and/or environmentally responsible criteria. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Furthermore, those of us working
for a full range of resource
rents as the basis for earth rights democracy view oil rent fund
investment in real estate worldwide as an expropriation of surface
land resource rents from other nations and thus are not a just source
of interest income for the citizens of oil rent fund countries like
Alaska and Norway.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The Alaskan and Norwegian funds,
and the Nigerian fund if it is
established, needs to have socially and environmentally responsible
criteria. Investments should be made in renewable energy - wind,
solar, green hydrogen, microhydropower - and in reforestation and
other environmental restoration activities. A portion of the funds
should be made available as interest free (suggested 2% - 3%
management fee) revolving loan funds to people in developing nations
to help finance their efforts for sustainable development.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A criteria of the loans should be
that the communities receiving
the loans begin implementing surface land value (ground rent)
recapture in their towns, regions and nations. Land value based
resource rent funds, if full ground rent is collected for the people
as a whole, promotes land reform and affordable land access for
current and future generations in addition to generating funds for
public benefits and citizen dividends.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small> In the US
about one half of corporate profits comes from real
estate related activities so we know that resource rents from surface
lands could be a substantial source of funds for basic income and
citizen dividends. In addition to land sites, rents from the
electromagnetic spectrum, water power points and satellite orbital
zones should be sourced for citizen dividends in the future.&nbsp; <a

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Interaction_EP.html">The
Interaction of Moral and Economic Approaches to
Ecological Protection
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When human actions cause
ecological consequences that harm
humans
or other species, the propriety of those actions is a moral question.
But when, either because of limited resources or because of
conflicting purposes, people cannot do all that they wish to protect
the environment, then environmental protection is a matter of
economics as well as morality.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Harm to humans differs from harm
to other species, for three
reasons. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, we recognize greater obligations to humans than to
other species. We recognize obligations to each human individual, while
our obligations to other species tend to be seen as obligations to the
species as a whole. </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, because of the possibility of communication with
humans through language, we can have information about the adequacy of
compensation to humans in a way not possible when seeking to compensate
other species. </small></li>
  <li><small>Third, humans are ordinarily concerned with the well-being
of other species, not just because other species are required for the
advancement of their selfish interests, but also because humans
acknowledge an obligation to all species for their own sakes. Thus any
harm to other species is a harm to humans as well, while we ordinarily
do not think of other species as being harmed by harm to humans. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As beings with awareness of right
and wrong, humans have
potential
moral obligations to all species. There are at least three types of
effort to protect other species that a person can make out of his own
moral convictions, while asserting at most a minimal right to impose
his morality on others. For each type of effort, two levels can be
identified:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. He can adopt personal
rules of conduct. He can
apply these rules first to his own direct conduct, and then to others,
as a condition for cooperating with them, as through trade. </small>
  <p><small>2. He can engage in moral dialogue with others, seeking to
persuade them to voluntarily adopt his practices of respect for other
species, first with respect to their own conduct, and then as a
condition for cooperating with others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. He can persuade his community to adopt a standard of
behavior that will be required of members of the community. Anyone with
a contrary opinion can join another community. In this way, for
example, communities outlaw cock fights. Because there are always some
costs of relocating, there will be some harm to those who disagree.
Such standards are least likely to infringe on the rights of dissenting
individuals when they are most local. At the second level, a person can
persuade his community to require a standard of behavior of its trading
partners. Such action is likely to be most persuasive when the
proscribed action is directly related to a traded commodity, as when
the Unites States outlawed the importation of tuna caught with nets
that killed large numbers of dolphins.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the absence of perfect
universal divine revelation, it is
virtually inevitable that people will disagree about the extent of
their obligations to other species. Thus, in addition to seeking a
common understanding of our obligations to other species, we must
seek ways to justly accommodate disagreements about these
obligations. This is where theories of economic justice enter.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition to the efforts listed
above, which a person can
pursue
on the basis of personal moral conviction, with almost no
interference with the rights of others who do not share his moral
conviction, a person can also advance a theory of justice that
permits him to limit the harm to nature that others cause. In my
view, the best basis for claiming a right to limit the harm that
others do to nature is a classical liberal theory of justice, similar
to that developed by Henry George in <b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and
Poverty</a></i></b> (1879) or by Bruce Ackerman in <b><i>Social Justice
in the Liberal State</i></b> (1980). A classical liberal theory of
justice recognizes the rights of all persons to equal shares of
natural opportunities (that is, everything outside of human beings
and the value created by human effort) and the right of each
individual to pursue his personal conception of the good. Thus under
a classical liberal theory of justice, any individual can assert a
right to protect his share of the environment.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The idea that all natural
opportunities belong equally to all
humanity is a radical idea with profound implications for many areas
of human activity, from public finance without coercive taxes to
world peace to the meaning of human freedom. The management of the
environment under such a liberal theory, with each person potentially
having a different conception of the protection that other species
deserve, provides a challenge for economic theory but not an
insurmountable one.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider, for example, the
protection of whales. If whales
are not
persons (which they might become if we found ourselves in moral
dialogue with them), then hunting whales may be allowed but limited,
either because some humans wish to exercise their rights to nature by
protecting whales, or because a reduction in the number of whales
impoverishes the world for this generation and for future
generations. If the fraction <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">f</span> of the world's
population wishes to
protect whales, then that fraction of whales is off limits to whale
hunters. For the fraction of whales that may be hunted, if hunting
causes a loss to other potential hunters in this generation, then
those who kill whales should be charged a fee for the economic losses
that their behavior causes, with the proceeds shared equally among
all potential hunters. If the level of hunting is so great as to
cause the number of whales per capita that are available to the next
generation of humans to fall below the number available to this
generation, then the hunting fee should be the larger of the value of
the loss to other potential hunters in this generation and the value
of the loss of environmental quality to the next generation.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Interaction_EP.html">Read the whole

</div>
<p>Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Owners paying higher land dues feel pressured
to develop their land in order to pay their dues, and development is
already blighting many suburbs and farmland. Won't the PTS force
premature or excessive development, losing open space and ecologically
sensitive areas? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Environmentalists
should understand that development
is actually needed to spare land. Using some land more intensely means
using other land not at all. The PTS stimulates construction in the
most intensely-used locations; compact urban form leaves more
surrounding countryside pristine.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Since about one-fifth of urban
areas
are vacant or underused land, and half is devoted to cars, there's
plenty of room in cities for growth.</span> While suburban commercial
centers
compete with downtown for redevelopment, each new building, whether for
business or residents, must find tenants.<br>
<br>
Higher density is the expected result of the PTS, yet many people
oppose higher density. However, the noxious component is not a higher
density of population but of automobiles, creating congestion, noise,
noxious smells, and danger. The PTS, by clearing out the infestation of
vehicles, makes human habitats more livable and the added people
unnoticeable.<br>
<br>
Without coercion or remote planning, the PTS improves our settlement
patterns. Regulations and zoning, some assume, might be vitiated or
obviated, become obsolete. Instead, the PTS makes it easier for
regulations and zoning to do their job. Since the land tax lowers land
price, buying land for parks and reserves is more easily afforded. The
loss in revenue from removing the newly public lands from the tax rolls
would be offset somewhat by the corresponding rise in value of sites
near the protected open space. Creating green spaces raises the density
of already developed land, and thus its value. Furthermore, land dues
reduce the profit from land development, making it a less attractive
investment, and land use decisions of less economic consequence. After
a while, people with deep pockets would turn to investments that,
post-shift, would be untaxed. Reserving land for recreational or
natural uses becomes less contentious; people could more easily
determine an optimum proportion of green space to developed space.<br>
<br>
Redirecting land rent from owner to government might merely pass the
motive to exploit from owner to state, possibly the next implacable
force against conservation. However, while an individual must use their
own land most intensely to maximize profit, a government must optimize
land use to maximize its land tax base. That is, land value thruout the
jurisdiction is lower when there is border-to-border development;
overall values are higher when some space is kept open. From the
government's point of view, there's more rent to be collected when
highest and best use includes nonuse.<br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and
automobile. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the
public, governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small>Henry David Thoreau said
the best thing government can do for
business is get out of it. Nevertheless, some hope to shift subsidies
from grey bads to green goods. Yet the state need not subsidize at
all. It's dauntingly difficult to know whom to fund; a solar steam
generator may be the most promising idea one day while photovoltaics
are the next. Efficient alternatives don't need largesse but
fairness. A handout shields new industry from the forces that compel
efficient growth. The best thing government can do for the
environment is exit environmental enterprise.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now wipe out the taxes, subsidies,
liability limits, and rent
retention. Instead, replace all that with running government like a
business. Charge full-market value for state acknowledgements (the
seven secret subsidies):

<small>Collecting rent for
government-granted privileges would not only raise trillions but also
whittle corporations down to a competitive size, less hazardous to
democracy. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides charging what privileges
are worth, government should also
replace license with responsibility ("internalize the
externalities"). To temper the temptation to use lands both fragile
and valuable, society could impose surcharges - an Ecology Security
Deposit, Restoration Insurance, Emission Permits, and fines when
users exceed standards. To minimize all these charges, producers
would seek sustainable alternatives. Getting and sharing rent from
land titles is the centerpiece of this geonomic revenue reform. Each
phase of such a revenue shift motivates sustainable choices in its
own way. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To sustain that which we love, we
must transform our relationships
to nature, to government, and to each other. We need to become

its highest and best use, it would obviate megatons of water imports,
and with them the associated environmental damage. </small>
  <p><small>I myself possess a share of this river, which rises
naturally in
an area of intense water shortage, yet I waste it. Why? There is hardly
any variable charge imposed on me for using more. There is a yearly
fixed cost, at about $20 per acre-foot for a 'standard' amount. The
'standard' hasn't changed in a century, and is much more than I
properly need. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Incidentally, the small charge covers expenses of the Gage
Canal
Co., which delivers to me in the cheapest old-fashioned way, by
gravity, in rotation with other users. There is no charge at all for
water as such. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Meantime, the State is importing water here at a true
social cost
of about $2,000 per acre foot, 100 times what I pay). If there were a
market where I could sell my 'right' for a tenth of that price I would
surely do so, but there isn't, so I am waiting. If there were a price
charged to me at a tenth of that cost, I would not buy, but there
isn't, so I am taking. Thus I, and thousands like me, just stand pat
and waste water. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Abuse of local waters in arid areas of high demand, like
Southern
California, results in 'hydro-imperialism.' The prevailing ethic is
mixed-up macho. Conservation is for sissies: Real Men don't conserve
water; Real Men prove they possess predatory genes by preying on
peaceful people's waters. The predators can build more golf courses in
the Sonoran desert of the Coachella Valley. </small></p>
  <small> <b>(b) Subsidy
wastes both dollars and ecologies. </b> <br>
Hydro-imperialism is the common enemy of Sierra Clubbers and
economists. That is lucky for economists, because Sierra Clubbers have
more clout. For example, twenty years ago some pork-barrellers proposed
pumping water from the lower Mississippi River up to West Texas, to
overcome drought in Lubbock. It was to be one of the The Great
Boondoggles -- a real record-smasher for pure waste. </small>
  <p><small>I laughed when I read ecologists were fighting it to save
the
habitat of some unremembered nothing-bird, say the 'Least Southwestern
Shiny-rumped Fleapicker.'<strong> ... </strong>  </small></p>
  <small></small>
  <p><small><b>'You have no right to stop growth,' says the
hydro-imperialist.
I agree, but insist on the counterpart: we have no duty to subsidize
growth. Hydro-imperialists and allied land speculators have no right to
demand subsidies.</b> Water supply and flood control and navigation
projects, the traditional kinds, are heavily subsidized. Subsidy
generates waste almost by definition, in the amount of the subsidy. If
it is a subsidy to withdraw water it also creates scarcity of water
where nature may have given us plenty. Consider the lower Colorado
River. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Every major user
is
subsidized, mostly by Congress. </span>No one pays a dime for water at
the source, but everyone gets paid to suck it up and take it home. No
wonder there is a shortage. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No
wonder there are 82 golf courses operating in the Coachella Valley, a
Sonoran desert, and 50 more planned.</span> </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No wonder The
U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation can't even find takers for water carried to
Phoenix in its multi-billion dollar Granite Reef Aqueduct. </span>I
could go on, but exhorting Congress not to waste money is scolding
sinners in Sodom. Come on, ecologists, find an endangered species! </small></p>
  <small> <b>(c) Correct
economic analysis prescribes more water for fish</b> <br>
Twenty years ago a study on the S... River of B.... prescribed
sacrificing the fishery to a proposed power project, reasoning as
follows. The fishery has no value because it is overcrowded; 'its rent
has been dissipated by the tragedy of the commons'. </small>
  <p><small>The value of the catch is only great enough to pay the
fishermen.
The fishery as such therefore has no residual value; it adds nothing to
the total value. Take it away and nothing is lost, net of costs. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>That is a profound fallacy. You will have noted it is a way
of
'dehumanizing' fishermen and assuming away their unemployment costs,
but that is not my main point. It says you should remove water from the
use that is crowded with people, and dedicate it to the use of fewer
people. This violates the basic law of diminishing return'; (a.k.a.
variable proportions). It violates good marginal analysis, a bedrock of
economics. <strong>... </strong>  </small></p>
  <small><b>(d) Correct
economic analysis presumes public trusts</b> <br>
Another thing some economists do right is to acknowledge that
'entitlements' -- the initial assignments of property rights - have a
major effect on the relative bargaining power of different parties. </small>
  <p><small>For years, economists would ask, say, canoers what they as
individuals would pay to keep a river wild.. They got rather low
valuations, and duly reported them as the value of recreation. This was
an effective defensive strategy for dam builders. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>One day it occurred to some unsung genius to ask not what
the
canoer would pay for the wild river; ask what the power company would
have to pay the canoer, and all potential canoers, to extinguish their
entitlements.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>The second question presumes that canoers, as citizens,
already
own the wild river. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>In recent years ecologists have been catching onto this
point and
rubbing the noses of legislators and bad economists in it. In the
currert lingo, one arguing ex parte the canoers stresses that canoers' <b>WTA
(Willingness to Accept)</b> is the relevant dollar value, and it is
higher, perhaps much higher, than their <b>WTP (Willingness to Pay)</b>.&nbsp;
  </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>In defense, the black-hat economists are developing the new
defensive strategy of trivializing the matter by claiming WTP = WTA. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>They follow a Chicago-School guru, one Ronald Coase, who
has
written it doesn't really matter how you assign entitlements so long as
it is clear and firm. Then just call the signal for 'Free Market!' an
punt: everything will work out for the best. Property will be allocate
the same, no matter who starts the game with all the chips, because WTP
= WTA. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Bunk! You are not surprised when someone says 'My home is
not for
sale. I will not sell at any price' even in our highly mobile,
commercially oriented society. They can take that attitude when they
hold the initial entitlement. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>You would be amazed to hear anyone say 'I will pay any
price,'
There are many documented instances of a person swearing under oath his
land is worth no more than $X for tax assessment purpose and soon
thereafter swearing again it is worth $15X when being condemned for a
park or other public use, because he wouldn't sell it for less. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Modern' micro-economics is a throwback to the old
Manchester
School, some of whose members carried Adam Smith far beyond Smith's
intent. They prescribed 'free trade in land' as the solution to all
resource problems -- free trade beginning with entitlements inherited
from millennia of conquest, corruption, aristocracy, confiscations,
negligence, covin and fraud. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>In this narrow view, everyone is an economic man; everyone
has his
price; all decisions are marginal; etc. Facts are forced to fit that
theology. <i>One modernist works the northwest Pacific Coast these
days taking questionnaire surveys to put a value on environmental
values. He has written that he rejects and screens out WTA answers when
they exceed WTP answers by more than 5%. They don't fit the model, so
they are invalid 'aberrations.'</i></small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>If so, aborigines are aberrations. Consider Indian tribes
with
Treaty Rights to fish. Their WTP for those rights is minimal, partly
because their ability to pay (ATP) is minimal. In addition, the mere
hypothesis they are the ones who must pay implies they are impoverished
and cannot pay anything. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>On the other hand, their WTA presumes their Treaty Rights
are
valid and they are in control. In their culture, traditional land
rights rank very high relative to money. They have seen people squander
money and be ruined by it land is not squanderable, by nature. Land has
more than marginal value to them because they have just one way of
life, based on fishing. Substitution of other lands is not part of
their ethic. Religion is also involved. It is entirely believable they
mean it when they say they will not sell 'at any price.' They may be
unreasonable, but that's the point: ownership lets you be as
unreasonable as you please. We only notice when someone else has the
entitlement. Politics and institutions are involved: Treaty Rights are
the most valuable mode of holding property there can be. They enjoy
legal supremacy as high as the Constitution itself (Article VI, Section
2), preempting contracts and ordinary legislation. </small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If someone buys a ticket to Super Bowl and decides not to go and sells it
      for more than its face value, he could face the wrath of the law. If he bought
      a super location and sold it for more than he paid for it, he could become
      a pillar of society. Temporary ownership for profiteering is illegal; but if
      permanent ownership, it is legal. If only we had a single standard, I think
      society
    would change for better. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It doesn't matter who
    owns what. What
    matters is who gets the rent.</span> We have millions of acres of forest
    we Americans own together, and we are losing rent on it.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">The word property cannot convey the distinction
    between
    rent and land. </span>Ralph Borsodi came up with an alternative, a trust that
    would claim publicly and occupy privately and use sparingly and compensate neighborly.
    Share the rent with
    neighbors. A word for that is <span style="font-weight: bold;">geonomics, earth-focused
    economics.</span> It hones in on all this flow of rent that is so overlooked.
    Shift the focus to sharing; then owning of land loses importance and belonging
    to earth regains its importance. It is a different identity for human beings
    as parts of the economic
    system.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The amount of <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">rent </span>has to total
    some amount. If you ask how much taxes are, you get a figure, or how much wages
    or interest are, you could get a figure. No one does a good job of keeping track
    of how much we spend or how much nature we use. In some of the best estimates,
    Ronald Banks in England estimates that the flow of rent is as great if not more
    than any of those other
    flows. Assuming that is true, <span style="font-weight: bold;">if not allowed
    to collect in the wrong pockets, but redirected to
    everybody's pockets,</span> we can expect a solution. How would you do
    it?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You could collect it via service tax, extractive tax, user fees; there
          are many different ways to collect. <br>
      </li>
    <li>You can return it to the residents of the region, through subsidies or
          dividends. Alaska has an oil dividend to citizens, and different kinds of
          taxes exist everywhere. It is a matter of disbursement.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you were to choose the Libertarian version,
    and rely
    on fees and dividends, you get a geobonus, an added benefit.</span> You would
    quit distorting prices, you could pull government back in a sense. Now taxes
    and subsidies at the margin can make housing unaffordable to maintain, so the
    apartment owner lets his apartment building become dilapidated and causes nearby
    owners to do
    the same. He can breed a slum. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
    We subsidize water and make water cheap for farmers in Arizona to irrigate their
    land, and we then have taxes to pay for environmental absurdities. Shift to fees
    and dividends and have prices precise and use the weight of the market to guide
    our choices toward sustainability. If we had this price leveling, we could get
    the market to work right. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">There are four reasons this could be
    fair.</span> In history three times when land tax was applied on increased value,
    it also
    increased land ownership, and tenure was extended.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Last century in Denmark, land taxes were increased. </li>
    <li>In the 1890s in California irrigation districts, they went from a few
      ranches to many small farms. </li>
    <li>In the 1950s a land tax in Taiwan broke up huge plantations and resulted
          in many family farms. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the past, land owners owed services to
        king, but in this age of equality then we owe our neighbors. We have an equal
        right to the earth. </span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The community creates rent.</span> Land
        value rises when infrastructure goes on land. Technology progresses when
        the community becomes more tranquil and density goes up. Density is a really
        good measure of land value. No one owner by himself is responsible for density.
        Rent from land value is justified because all should share in the rent. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">If the community collected the rent, it would
      motivate owners not to speculate in anticipation of a higher future return.
      There would be a tendency to infill in the city and make cities more efficient.</span> It
      would make mass transit more efficient. We could collect some rent in a greater
      amount as ecological security deposits for gas stations with gas pump brownfields.
      We could actually put a surcharge on gasoline and put the playing field back
      to level between cars and other transportation. If we collected ground rent
      around transit stops and dedicated that income stream to the transit system,
      we could run a free system. When built, BART (Bay Area CA Rapid Transit) did
      a study and found it could run BART free. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">If we had free mass transit,
      people would choose to ride instead of drive.</span> It becomes more efficient
      and more people use, increasing the mobility of citizens in the region. If
      we get people out of cars, that reduces air pollution, noises, run off, and
      use of resources. </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is not just collecting ground rent but
        also untaxing other systems. Untax labor and make it more affordable.</span> Enterprises
        such as recycling and reforestation, weatherization, reconstruction, and
        health enterprises are labor intensive and made more expensive artificially
        by taxing labor. We subsidize business: free roads for the timber industry,
        cheap water for agribusiness. Stop those subsidies and recycling could compete. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
    On a level field, recycling would roll over extraction of virgin material. We
    could spare forests and salmon and have a healthier eco system. Look at restoration.
    Money has to come from the public treasury but we could look at it as public
    investment. Pay for restoration and land values increase, so land dividends would
    increase. Direct investment benefits the entire
    public. ... <a href="docs/Smith_SRTS.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
    that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
    to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use in an urban context
    is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who gets the principal
    benefits from urban economic growth. Its ownership is a major determinant
    of the degree of economic inequality: surges of land prices, such as have
    occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions
    of wealth. In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and
    nature more generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological
    sustainability. <strong>Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing
    affordability and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the
    land question.&#8217; ...</strong></p>
  <p>While still ignored by the economic orthodoxy, interest in George&#8217;s
    work has been stimulated by modern concerns about housing affordability and
    environmental decay. Such revival of interest recognises that these problems
    stem, in part, from inadequate policies relating to land. Some members of
    Green parties, in particular, have embraced Georgist ideas. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong>Environmental Concerns</strong></p>
  <p>What about the relevance of Georgist ideas to current concerns with environmental
    quality and ecological sustainability? Here too there is a strong claim to
    consider. Interest in Georgism has been reinvigorated in recent years by
    the need to develop public policies that reflect the nature of land as a
    finite natural resource. From a &#8216;green&#8217; perspective, land tax
    is a useful tool in discouraging the excessive and wasteful use of land.
    That is, the prospect of paying a high rate of land tax can be expected to
    discourage people from purchasing more land than they need directly for their
    own purposes. It accords with the principle that people should be taxed according
    to their use of scarce environmental assets.</p>
  <p>This &#8216;ecological take&#8217; on Georgism is particularly powerful
    at a time of intensifying global environmental problems and recognition of
    the need for remedial policy responses. It requires creative extension of
    Georgist principles because the limitation of George&#8217;s own analysis
    in this context is its primary focus on land. A range of other natural resources
    needs to be considered, linking up with the broader concerns of modern environmentalists
    such as Herman Daly (see, for example, Daly and Cobb, 1990). Hence, land
    tax should be seen as an adjunct to taxes on the use of other scarce environmental
    assets, including mineral, forestry and fishing stocks, and also bandwidth
    for radio and telecommunications, for example (Stilwell, 2002: 316-317).
    It should also be seen as a corollary to other taxes that discourage environmental
    damage, including resource rental taxes, carbon taxes and fuel excises.</p>
  <p>The case for these environmental taxes need not necessarily rest on Georgist
    principles, of course, but Georgism can claim to provide a unifying analytical
    framework. A common feature of &#8216;environmental taxes&#8217; is that
    they are all targeted, like land tax, at reducing the scope for profiting
    from the private appropriation of natural resources, and thereby restricting
    the profligate use of those resources.</p>
  <p>A tension remains, reflecting the Georgist orientation towards taxes rather
    than more directly regulatory interventions. Whether the use of the price
    mechanism in this &#8216;environmental fine tuning&#8217; is sufficient for
    dealing with pervasive environment threats is a moot point. The nature and
    severity of environmental stresses is such that more directly proscriptive
    environmental policies are commonly needed to protect natural resources.
    The creation and maintenance of national parks, for example, constitutes
    a necessary direct regulation of land-use: the market, even when modified
    by taxes, cannot absolutely guarantee the conservation of such crucial assets.
    In other words, protection of &#8216;natural capital&#8217; may commonly
    require regulation as well as taxation. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p>Natural Assets<br>
    In 2002, economists Robert Costanza and Paul Sutton estimated the contribution
      of ecosystem services to the U.S. economy at $2 trillion. Ecosystem services
      represent the benefits humans derive from natural ecosystems, including
      food from wild plants and animals, climate regulation, waste assimilation,
      fresh water replenishment, soil formation, nutrient cycling, flood control,
      pollination, raw materials, and more. Using data from many previous studies,
      as well as satellite photography, Costanza and Sutton estimated values
      for ecosystems per unit of biome (an acre of rain forest, or grasslands,
      or desert, for example). They then multiplied by the total area of each
      biome and summed over all services and biomes.</p>
  <p>If $2 trillion represents the yearly contribution of nature to the U.S.
    economy, what&#8217;s the underlying value of America&#8217;s natural assets?
    One way to answer this is to treat yearly ecosystem services as &#8220;earnings&#8221; produced
    by &#8220;stocks&#8221;of natural assets.These earnings can then be multiplied
    by the average price/earnings ratio of publicly traded stocks over the last
    fifty years (16.5/1) to arrive at an estimated natural asset value of $33
    trillion.</p>
  <p>This figure is, if anything, an underestimate, because it ignores a singular
    aspect of nature: its irreplaceability. If Corporation X were to go out of
    business, its useful contributions to society would quickly be supplied by
    another corporation.</p>
  <p>If a natural ecosystem were to disappear, however, it could not so easily
    be replaced. Thus, an irreplaceability premium of indeterminate magnitude
    should be added to the $33 trillion. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
