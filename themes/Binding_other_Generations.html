 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">    </a>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Either the land of Ireland rightfully belongs to the Irish
    landlords, or it rightfully belongs to the Irish people; there can be
    no middle ground.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If it rightfully belongs to the landlords, then is
      the whole agitation wrong, and every scheme for interfering in any
      way with the landlords is condemned. </li>
    <li>If the land rightfully belongs
      to the landlords, then it is nobody else's business what they do with
      it, or what rent they charge for it, or where or how they spend the
      money they draw from it, and whoever does not want to live upon it on
      the landlords' terms is at perfect liberty to starve or emigrate. </li>
    <li>But
      if, on the contrary, the land of Ireland rightfully belongs to the
      Irish people, then the only logical demand is, not that the tenants
      shall be made joint owners with the landlords, not that it be bought
      from a smaller class and sold to a larger class, but that it be
      resumed by the whole people. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To propose to pay the landlords for it
    is to deny the right of the people to it. The real fight for Irish
    rights must be made outside of Ireland; and, above all things, the
    Irish agitators ought to take a logical position, based upon a broad,
    clear principle which can be everywhere understood and appreciated.
    To ask for tenant-right or peasant proprietorship is not to take such
    a position; to concede that the landlords ought to be paid is utterly
    to abandon the principle that the land belongs rightfully to the
    people.
  </p>
  <p>To admit, as even the most radical of the Irish agitators seem to
    admit, that the landlords should be paid the value of their lands, is
    to deny the rights of the people. It is an admission that the
    agitation is an interference with the just rights of property. It is
    to ignore the only principle on which the agitation can be justified,
    and on which it can gather strength for the accomplishment of
    anything real and permanent. To admit this is to admit that the Irish
    people have no more right to the soil of Ireland than any outsider.
    For, any outsider can go to Ireland and buy land, if he will give its
    market value. To propose to buy out the landlords is to propose to
    continue the present injustice in another form. They would get in
    interest on the debt created what they now get in rent. They would
    still have a lien upon Irish labor.</p>
  <p>And why should the landlords be paid? If the land of Ireland
    belongs of natural right to the Irish people, what valid claim for
    payment can be set up by the landlords? No one will contend that the
    land is theirs of natural right, for the day has gone by when men
    could be told that the Creator of the universe intended his bounty
    for the exclusive use and benefit of a privileged class of his
    creatures &#8211; that he intended a few to roll in luxury while their
    fellows toiled and starved for them. The claim of the landlords to
    the land rests not on natural right, but merely on municipal
    law &#8211; on municipal law which contravenes natural right. And,
    whenever the sovereign power changes municipal law so as to conform
    to natural right, what claim can they assert to compensation? Some of
    them bought their lands, it is true; but they got no better title
    than the seller had to give. And what are these titles? Titles based
    on murder and robbery, on blood and rapine&#8211;titles which rest on
    the most atrocious and wholesale crimes. Created by force and
    maintained by force, they have not behind them the first shadow of
    right. That Henry II and James I and Cromwell and the Long Parliament
    had the power to give and grant Irish lands is true; but will any one
    contend they had the right?<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Will any
    one contend that in all the past
    generations there has existed on the British Isles or anywhere else
    any human being, or any number of human beings, who had the right to
    say that in the year 1881 the great mass of Irishmen should be
    compelled to pay &#8211; in many cases to residents of England, France,
    or the United States &#8211; for the privilege of living in their native
    country and making a living from their native soil? Even if it be
    said that might makes right; even if it be contended that in the
    twelfth, or seventeenth, or eighteenth century lived men who, having
    the power, had therefore the right, to give away the soil of Ireland,
    it cannot be contended that their right went further than their
    power, or that their gifts and grants are binding on the men of the
    present generation. </span>No one can urge such a preposterous
    doctrine.
    And, if might makes right, then the moment the people get power to
    take the land the rights of the present landholders utterly cease,
    and any proposal to compensate them is a proposal to do a fresh
    wrong.</p>
  <p>Should it be urged that, no matter on what they originally rest,
    the lapse of time has given to the legal owners of Irish land a title
    of which they cannot now be justly deprived without compensation, it
    is sufficient to ask, with Herbert Spencer, at what rate per annum
    wrong becomes right? Even the shallow pretense that the acquiescence
    of society can vest in a few the exclusive right to that element on
    which and from which Nature has ordained that all must live, cannot
    be urged in the case of Ireland. For the Irish people have never
    acquiesced in their spoliation, unless the bound and gagged victim
    may be said to acquiesce in the robbery and maltreatment which he
    cannot prevent. Though the memory of their ancient rights in the land
    of their country may have been utterly stamped out among the people
    of England, and have been utterly forgotten among their kin on this
    side of the sea, it has long survived among the Irish. If the Irish
    people have gone hungry and cold and ignorant, if they have been
    evicted from lands on which their ancestors had lived from time
    immemorial, if they have been forced to emigrate or to starve, it has
    not been for the want of protest. They have protested all they could;
    they have struggled all they could. It has been but superior force
    that has stifled their protests and made their struggles vain. In a
    blind, dumb way, they are protesting now and struggling now, though
    even if their hands were free they might not at first know how to
    untie the knots in the cords that bind them. But acquiesce they never
    have.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet, even supposing they had
    aquiesced, as in their ignorance the
    working-classes of such countries as England and the United States
    now acquiesce, in the iniquitous system which makes the common
    birthright of all the exclusive property of some. What then? Does
    such acquiescence turn wrong into right?</span> If the sleeping
    traveler
    wake to find a robber with his hand in his pocket, is he bound to buy
    the robber off &#8211; bound not merely to let him keep what he has
    previously taken, but pay him the full value of all he expected the
    sleep of his victim to permit him to get? If the stockholders of a
    bank find that for a long term of years their cashier has been
    appropriating the lion's share of the profits, are they to be told
    that they cannot discharge him without paying him for what he might
    have got, had his peculations not been discovered?
