<p>Everett Gross: <a href="../docs/Gross_Rent.html">Explaining Rent</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes it's difficult for people to understand the meaning of "rent" as
    an economic concept. One way I&nbsp;have of explaining it doesn't use the
    word rent. I just use a little analogy.</p>
  <p>I'm from Crete, Nebraska. It's a small town of 5,000 people.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose a man comes to Crete, and he wants to start a business. He needs
      a building, but first he needs a piece of ground to build this new building
      on. So he looks up a real estate agent, describes what he wants, and the
      real estate agent shows him a parcel that's just right for his needs. The
      man asks the agent, "All right, now how much money do you want for this
      land?" The agent says, "It's worth $50,000." The man says, "Why is it worth
      $50,000?" And the real estate agent points out that "The school is good,
      the roads are good, the police department is good, the rescue crew is good
      and very fast, and business is good here." </p>
    <p>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a fair price. I'll
      take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school people, and the road people,
      and the police department? To whom do I pay the $50,000?" And the real
      estate agent says, "Oh no. You don't pay it to them. You pay it to the
      person who owned the land before."</p>
    <p>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads, and the police,
      and the other good things?" And the real estate agent says, "<i>If</i> you
      build, then you'll pay for them again."</p>
    <p>The buyer then asks, &quot;And what will the previous owner do for me
      for my $50,000?&quot;&nbsp; The real estate man answers, &quot;Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing
      at all!&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now I&nbsp;don't need to use the word "rent" in that explanation.</p>

<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
    production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered. ...</p>
  <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
      the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
      the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
      reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural reward.
      The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep
      to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
      enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
      advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
      the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain
      to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
      supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
      it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
      rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
      else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
      besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
  <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts him
      to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
      and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
      and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
      And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
      and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
      labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
      this would commensurately increase.</p>
  <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
      or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
      of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
      one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
      would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
  <p>The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its death
      blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and millions of acres
      from which settlers are now shut out by high prices would be abandoned by their
      present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal terms. And this not merely
      on the frontiers, but within what are now considered well settled districts.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land cannot
            be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by all competent
            economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons untrained in economics.
            The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is that it cannot limit the supply
            of land. Landowners are presumably, before the tax is laid, charging all
            the rent they can get. There is nothing in a tax on the rental value of
            land to make tenants willing to pay more or to make land more difficult
            to hire. On the contrary, more land will be on the market, because of such
            a tax, rather than less, since the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding
            land out of use and unimproved for mere speculation. The competition of
            former vacant land speculators to get their land used will make land cheaper
            to rent rather than more expensive. And since only the net rent remaining
            after the tax is subtracted is capitalized into salable value, land will
            be very much cheaper to buy. H.G.B.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
      land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as agricultural
      land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep land from its
      most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for it than the use
      to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had
      attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
      would operate to force improvement. Whoever planted an orchard, or sowed a
      field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory, no matter how costly, would
      have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept so much land idle.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though
      his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with stock.</li>
    <li> The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the privilege
          of keeping other people off of it until he wanted to use it, as his
      neighbor who has a fine house upon his lot.</li>
    <li> It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon valuable
          land as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile of great
      warehouses filled with costly goods.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid before
      labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage his
      labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
    <li> the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much for
          a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
    <li> the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have to expend
          a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
    <li> And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in lieu
          of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and stock.
        <p><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional economists,
                have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension of this point.
                Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced that the greater
                cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor man who is trying to
                save enough from his earnings to buy a piece of land; for, it is said,
                the higher taxes on the land after it is acquired, offset the lower
                purchase price. What such objectors do not see is that even if the
                lower price of land does no more than balance the higher tax on it,
                (and this overlooks, for one thing, the discouragement to speculation
                in land), the reduction or removal of other taxes is all clear gain.
                It is easier to save in proportion as earnings and commodities are
                relieved of taxation. It is easier to buy land, because its selling
                price is lower, if the land is taxed. And although the land, after
                its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can this tax be fully
                paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the purchase price,
                but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on buildings and
                other improvements and in whatever other taxes are thus rendered unnecessary.

<p>    Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
      Henry George</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another area in which George
applied these inherent differences
between land and products was the field of taxation. To determine the
incidence of taxation, George had to know what was to be taxed,
products or the value of land. In each case he traced out the effect
from the essential nature of the thing to be taxed: "...all taxes
upon things of unfixed quantity increase prices, and in the course of
exchange are shifted from seller to buyer, increasing as they go.
...If we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must
finally pay it, for the erection of buildings will cease until
building rents become high enough to pay the regular profit and the
tax besides. ...In this way all taxes which add to prices are shifted
from hand to hand, increasing as they go, until they ultimately rest
upon consumers, who thus pay much more than is received by the
government. Now, the way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost
of production, and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human
production, and taxes upon...[land value] cannot check
supply. Therefore, though a tax on...[land value] compels the
land owners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for
the use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of
land. On the contrary, by compelling those who hold land on
speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land
values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus to
reduce the price of land." </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here, then is another
derivative difference between land and
products, according to George: taxation on products causes an
increase in the price of products; taxation on the value of land
causes a drop in the price of land. </span></small><small>... <a

<p>John Dewey: <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">Steps to Economic Recovery</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Consequently instead of attempting a technical explanation of the moral and
      economic philosophy of Henry George, I want to urge my hearers to acquaint
      themselves with his own works, to study them and then to organize to see that
      his principle is carried into effect. What are the most evident sore spots
      of the present? The answer is clear. Unemployment; extreme inequality in the
      distribution of the national income; enormous fixed charges in the way of interest
      on debts; a crazy, cumbrous, inequitable tax system that puts the burden on
      the consumer, and the ultimate producer, and lets off the parasites, exploiters
      and the privileged, -- who ought to be relieved entirely of their gorged excess,
      -- very lightly, and indeed in many cases, as in that of the tariff, pays them
      a premium for imposing a burden on honest industry and on the means of production;
      a vicious and incompetent banking system, with billions of money, the hope
      for the future of millions of hard-working peoples, still locked up, while
      the depositors lose their homes and walk the streets in vain; the greater part
      of our population, in the nation of the earth most favored by nature, still
      living either in slums or in homes without the improvements indispensable to
      a healthy and civilized life.</p>
  <p>You cannot study Henry George without learning how intimately each of these
      wrongs and evils is bound up with our land system. One of our great national
      weaknesses is speculation. Everybody recognizes that fact in the stock market
      orgy of our late boom days. Only a few realize the extent to which speculation
      in land is the source of many troubles of the farmer, the part it has played
      in loading banks and insurance companies with frozen assets and compelling
      the closing of thousands of banks, nor how the high rents, the unpayable mortgages
      and the slums of the cities are connected with speculation in land values.
      All authorities on public works hold that the most fruitful field for them
      is slum clearance and better housing. Yet only a few seem to realize that with
      our present situation this improvement will put a bonus in the pockets of landlords,
      and the land speculator will be the one to profit financially--for after all,
      buildings are built on land. ... <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

<p>Upton Sinclair: <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">The Consequences of Land
      Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
      Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But
    how about all the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation
    the most
      desirable land? <strong>The value of this land increases, not because of anything
      these owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</strong></p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The consequences
      of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and slums and luxury
      in the cities. <strong>A great part of the necessary land is held out of use,
      and so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can
      no longer
      own a home. </strong>The value of farm land also increases; so year by
      year more independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay
      interest on their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.</p>
  <p>This condition wrecked every empire in the history of mankind, and it is wrecking
      modern civilization. One of the first to perceive this was Henry George, and
      he worked out the program known as the Single Tax. Let society as a whole take
      the full rental value of land, so that no one would any longer be able to hold
      land out of use. So the value of land would decrease, and everyone could have
      land, and the community would have a great income to be spent for social ends.

and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls.&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens.</span> <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is
no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Social
Justice of Site Value Rating</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In primitive societies, land is
generally regarded as not ownable.
No one made the land, so how can anyone own it? Ownership generally
originates in conquest. In England, titles to land originated in the
claim of William the Conqueror to own all the land because he was
king. He granted to dukes, earls, etc. the right to collect rent from
designated territories in exchange for their promises to fulfill
various obligations to him. In the seventeenth century the nobility
succeeded in removing all of their obligations to the crown, but they
retained their rights to land. A substantial part of the great
inequality in wealth in the United Kingdom can be traced to ancient
patents of nobility that granted rights to collect rent. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One
highly visible consequence of allowing
land rents to be
privately appropriated is that young people find it nearly impossible
to buy houses. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The price of
a "house," in the Southeast of Britain at
least, is primarily the price of land.</span></span> If the rent of
land were
collected publicly, the price of land would be inconsequential, and
the price of a house would be the cost of the materials and labour
that went into building it. It should be recognized that if the site
value of land were taxed, the payment of such taxes would make it
more expensive to live in large cities than in small towns, but young
people would be better able to afford it because other taxes would be
reduced, <span style="font-weight: bold;">and the mortgages to which
people would need to commit
themselves would not be nearly as great.</span>&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<small>... </small>if the full rental value of land is collected
through site value
rating, then the sale value of unimproved land will fall to
approximately zero. The sale value of houses will fall to the value
of the houses themselves.</small>&nbsp; <small>... <a

<b></b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Making Housing
Affordable</b>
</small><br>
<small>The implementation of our ideas would have a dramatic effect in
making housing more affordable. The principal reason why housing
costs have risen so much is that the price of land has risen
enormously. Some increase in the price of access to land is a natural
accompaniment of an increasing population.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the very great increases of
recent years, which have made it
nearly impossible for young families to afford houses of their own,
have additional causes. The implementation of our ideas would bring
down the price of access to land in three ways.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, much land is held
off the market by speculators who may wait generations do decide to
develop it.</span> The introduction of a fee for holding land, whether
used or not, equal to the rental value of the land, will induce
speculators to either develop this land themselves or turn it over to
someone who will.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, an important
cause of higher prices for access to land by those who wish to build
low-cost housing is zoning restrictions. </span>These restrictions are
introduced by political factions that already have their houses and do
not mind if housing becomes scarcer. It just raises the market value of
their homes. But if a rise in land values were accompanied by rises in
the fees that existing residents had to pay for the use of the land on
which their houses sit, they would have an incentive to do what they
could to make land plentiful rather than scarce, and zoning
restrictions could be expected to diminish.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third, a person who
wishes to own a house must borrow money to cover the price of buying
the title to the land on which the house sits as well as the cost of
the house itself. </span>If the use of land required the payment of a
fee equal to the rental value of land, so that the selling price of
land titles became virtually zero, then the amount of money that a
family would have to borrow to purchase a house would fall. ...&nbsp; <a

</b>The recycling of savings into new mortgage lending has fueled an
economy-wide inflation of asset prices for land, homes, and commercial
properties, as well as stock market and bond prices. If what rises in
value is mainly the land site, then the property owners appear as
passive beneficiaries enjoying a free lunch. The property is their
major asset and the mortgage their major debt. While doing little to
increase the value of the building beyond having picked a good location
and making the normal maintenance, they ride the crest of asset-price
inflation of land . Indeed, take-home earnings have drifted down over
the past two decades, but house prices have soared. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These "capital gains" for
households are part of the new phenomenon that has been popularized as
"labor capitalism." As Margaret Thatcher's crowd has put it, "Sorry
you've lost your job; I hope you've made a killing on your Council
House or home in the real estate market." The free lunch.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For
the two-thirds of America's and Britain's populations who are home
owners, this free lunch from asset-price inflation of land has proved
to be a silver lining in the post-industrial economy. For the remaining
third of the population, however, the price of access to home ownership
is receding rapidly. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Today
it hardly is possible for most renters to earn the money to acquire
their own homes. </span></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The entry price
has</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> been bid up too high by those
hoping to gain from asset-price inflation even as labor's earnings have
been declining.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Its cost to the
economy</b></small><br>
<small>Once a building has taken all its depreciation, investors have a
tax motive to sell the property and buy another. The sales price
obviously will be higher if the new buyer can begin depreciating the
building all over again, for the property will yield more after-tax
revenue. This financial trick turns the real estate sector into a game
of musical chairs, while enabling property owners to avoid income
taxation. The end result is to free more of their cash flow to pledge
to mortgage lenders as interest, in exchange for loans to buy more and
more property that is rising in price. This is the anatomy of the
dramatic increase in land-prices, called the real estate bubble. The
tragedy of modern economies is this divergence of saving away from
financing new direct investment and employment, to inflate a financial
and real estate bubble. When the bubble bursts there will be little new
tangible wealth creation to show for it, only a wave of insolvency,
bankruptcy and foreclosures as the Western economies begin to look more
like that of Japan since its bubble burst a decade ago. America's and
Europe's largest economic expansion may similarly give way to a long
depression. Its cause will remain invisible as long as the politically
powerful real estate interests keep getting land undevalued and its
income masked as capital gains on the national income and product
accounts ...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

  Housing and the Land Value Tax Perspective: a letter to Asheville,
  North Carolina</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To make housing more affordable we advocate
        the reduction of the tax on buildings and a simultaneous rise of the tax
        on land to yield the same or more revenue. This is called Land Value Taxation.
        It is also called the two-rate tax, incentive taxation and the split-rate
        tax.</span> </p>
  <p>We know, from studies of the twenty Pennsylvania taxing jurisdictions that
      use LVT, that every time the tax on buildings is reduced, and simultaneously
      the tax on land is increased, that there is a spurt of construction. According
      to Plassmann and Tideman (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis of the Effects
      of Two-Rate Property Taxes in Pennsylvania</span>, Florenz Plassmann and
      T. Nicholas Tideman, September 1997, p19), "This means that, for an average municipality,
      an increase in the adjusted tax differential of 1 mil will yield an expected
      increase in the total value of construction of 1.58%". Much of this increase
      in construction comes from people improving their homes with the knowledge
      that the penalty for making improvements is being reduced. </p>
  <p>Does this provide more affordable housing? Pittsburgh has used the two-rate
      tax since 1915, 85 years. Recently, Lew Sichelman (The Housing Scene, by
    Lew Sichelman, the Los Angeles Times, Sunday, June 4, 2000) said "According to
      the federal government's latest tabulation, the average of both new and existing
      houses sold in 31 key markets nationwide reached $200,300 during the first
      three months of this year&#8230;. The San Francisco Bay Area&#8230;remains
      the most expensive place in the country in which to buy a house. The average
      price there is now $384,700. &#8230;At the other end of the price spectrum,
      the average remains under $150,000 in only two places: Pittsburgh at $143,300&#8230;.and
      St. Louis at $145,100." So Pittsburgh, the only sizeable city in the United
      States to use the two-rate tax, has the lowest cost housing in the country.
      A coincidence? Perhaps not. </p>
  <p>An interesting and amazing thing about the Pittsburgh experience is that the
      two-rate tax in Pittsburgh applies only to the city tax, not to the school
      tax and not to the county tax. It's impressive to say that for the city tax
      the tax rate on land is six times higher than the tax rate on buildings, but
      because of the much higher value of buildings, only about 57% of the city tax
      is from land. When you add the school tax and the county tax, less than 40%
      of the tax yield is from land. </p>
  <p>So a modest land tax applied over a long time (85 years) results in the lowest
      average cost of housing in the country. Imagine what would happen if the tax
      on buildings were eliminated and all of the city revenue came from the land
      tax. It boggles the mind to think about it. ... <a href="../docs/Hartheimer_AHatLVTP.html">read the entire article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Henry George, the eminent social philosopher of a century ago, turned the
    attention of planners and economists, however briefly, to the indefeasible
    factor of land scarcity. Capital and labor can increase; land cannot.</p>
  <p>Accordingly, George was the apostle of the single tax. It aimed most directly
    at land speculators. His insights would focus now on the limitations on the
    use of land imposed by zoning. If John Jones wants an acre protecting his
    house, he is laying claim to something that cannot expand in size. Since
    land, in George's analysis, is forever limited, it must be thought of and
    treated as common property. And therefore the rental value of one acre should
    constitute a tax (the single tax) on the person who sequesters it for himself.</p>
  <p>A strong case can be made for the amenities of zoning laws. But they have
    an effect on the availability of housing, and on its cost. One result is
    that housing costs are increasing faster than inflation.</p>
  <p>But is the Henry George factor likely to be espoused in political platforms?
    It cannot happen soon because too many interests are vested in zoning laws.
    But sharp political eyes should be trained on the question, in search of
    a viable formulation designed to fight against homelessness for grandchildren
    who cannot be expected to pay the projected cost of housing. ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/Buckley_HDH.htm">read

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is not just collecting ground rent but
        also untaxing other systems. Untax labor and make it more affordable.</span> Enterprises
        such as recycling and reforestation, weatherization, reconstruction, and
        health enterprises are labor intensive and made more expensive artificially
        by taxing labor. We subsidize business: free roads for the timber industry,
        cheap water for agribusiness. Stop those subsidies and recycling could compete. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
    On a level field, recycling would roll over extraction of virgin material. We
    could spare forests and salmon and have a healthier eco system. Look at restoration.
    Money has to come from the public treasury but we could look at it as public
    investment. Pay for restoration and land values increase, so land dividends would
    increase. Direct investment benefits the entire
    public. </p>
  <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Now the public is paying for private parties.
        That is not fair.</span> Look at the economy. Take taxes off homes, and
        they become more affordable. Have some kind of land charge, and housing
        stock
        increases as sites get developed. Affordable housing helps stabilize
        neighborhoods. In places that do have the land tax, i.e., Australia and
        New Zealand, they
        have fewer disputes with assessment. Assessors say their job is so much
        easier now. If land is less profitable and less of a political football,

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Like all creatures --
goldfinches, squirrels, butterflies, cicadas --
we humans are squatters on this planet. We all need a part of earth for
shelter, nourishment, a work site and a place to raise the next
generation. Otherwise we perish. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>
In the 1980s, Washington, D.C., was concerned about its growing army of
homeless. At that time I found there were 8,000 boarded-up dwelling
units in our Nation's Capital -- more than enough to accommodate some
5,000 street people. I also found there were 11,500 privately owned
vacant lots in the District of Columbia, mostly zoned for and suitable
for homes or apartments. Decent housing on these sites held in cold
storage would have provided an alternative for the many low-income
families squatting in places that were overcrowded, overpriced, overrun
with vermin and overloaded with safety hazards.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
These issues spurred my research described in a 1988 report, "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Affordable Housing -- A Missing Link</span>."
Evidence from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and other
sources over a 30-year period revealed the following average cost
increases of items that go into the building and maintenance of housing:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Wages of general building construction workers rose 14
percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Wages of special trade construction workers rose 11
percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Construction material costs rose 11.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Combined wage-materials-managerial costs for residential
building rose 12.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Fuel and utility costs for housing rose 13.8 percent a
year. All
of these costs closely tracked the Consumer Price Index which, over
these same 30 years, rose by 12 percent a year. According to those
figures, housing prices and housing rents apparently were held in check</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Why do those statistics not seem to jibe with what you have been told,
seen with your own eyes, and felt in your own pocketbooks?</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How to explain that, during the last decade of my research
period, U.S.
households with serious housing problems increased from 19 to 24
millions?</small></li>
  <li><small>What caused the portion of renters paying more than 35
percent of their
income for housing doubled from 21 to 41 percent during the last two
decades of the study period?</small></li>
  <li><small>Why were over 2.4 million renters paying 60 percent or
more of their income for rent?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The
answers would be obvious except that, so far, I have not mentioned
what happened to the price of the land that housing sits on. Many of
those who talk and write about housing conveniently overlook the fact
that housing does not exist in mid air but is attached to the land, and
that the price of this land has gone through the stratosphere.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
In contrast to those 11- to 14-percent annual increases in
housing-related costs, residential land values nationwide rose almost
80 percent a year, or almost 2000 percent over those three
decades.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>A close friend in
Bethesda bought a house and lot there 40 years ago
for $20,000. Two months ago he sold the property for a cool half
million. That 2400 percent increase was entirely land value. The buyer
immediately demolished the house to put up a larger one, so he clearly
paid half a million for the location value -- the land value -- alone.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Officials, civic leaders and commentators who bemoan the lack of
affordable housing nevertheless applaud each rise in real estate values
as a sign of prosperity. Seeing their own assets multiply through no
effort of their own apparently makes them forget the teachers, firemen,
police and low-income people who are boxed out of a place to squat in
their cities and neighborhoods. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many of our
Founding Fathers, George Washington included, had amassed huge estates.
But the property tax induced them to sell off excess lands they were
not using.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One
of the many virtues of a tax on land values is that it can be
introduced gradually. Cities that take this incremental approach report
that homeowners-voters-taxpayers hardly notice the change. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">What's important in modernizing
your taxation is not the speed of change but the direction you choose.</span>
If you keep the present tax system with its disincentives for compact
and wholesome growth, you will experience the treadmill effect that has
been so familiar in so-called urban and housing "solutions." You will
have to keep running faster and faster with patchwork remedies to keep
from sliding backward.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
A caution. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Revising taxes as proposed
here will not end the need for
housing subsidies, at least not in the short run, but it will do three
things that should greatly reduce subsidies. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>One, by deflating land costs it will enable the private
market to offer homes and sites at lower costs. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Two, this will shrink the number of families needing
subsidies. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Three, it will stretch subsidy dollars farther because
sites for publicly assisted housing can be acquired far more cheaply.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
In Conclusion, I have tried to show that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">America has a housing land
problem, not an affordable housing problem.</span> This problem can be
substantially alleviated by freeing the market of anti-enterprise taxes
and by<span style="font-weight: bold;"> turning the property tax right
side up -- that is, by dropping
tax rates on housing and by raising them on publicly-created land
values. </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"

Edward L. Glaeser of Harvard and Joseph E. Gyourko of the Wharton
School, whom he quotes as follows: "America is not facing a nationwide
affordable housing crisis. --- In large areas of the country housing
costs are quite close to the cost of new construction." These areas
"represent the bulk of American housing" and they are areas where "land
is quite cheap." I can&#8217;t confirm the quote, but it reads like something
Glaeser and Gyourko might have written: they also claim that the
apparent price of land in Manhattan is only an illusion, the product of
zoning laws.&nbsp; The true or &#8220;hedonic&#8221; price is not much above
farmland.&nbsp; How do they figure that?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t ask!&nbsp; It&#8217;s
exclusionary obscurantism at its worst.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In a Brookings paper, housing authority Karl Case of Wellesley
and
financial prophet Robert Shiller of Yale write on housing. This is a
hasty paper, not of the same quality as their previous work, but there
it is under their names.&nbsp; They write that housing became more
affordable from 1995 to 2003 &#8220;in the vast majority of states.&#8221;&nbsp;
Thus easily they dismiss the minority of states with the majority of
the U.S. population and land values, and the highest ratio of land
prices to building prices.&nbsp; Metropolitan New York, with 10% of the
U.S. population, and a higher percentage of its land value, is a big
chunk of the U.S.A. all by itself.</small><br>
<br>
<small>3,000 miles west, Deborah Reid of the Public Policy Institute of
California delivers a parallel locution: &#8220;there is no housing shortage
in California outside of Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and San
Diego.&#8221;&nbsp; Yes, and Switzerland is all flat, outside of The
Alps.&nbsp; Is this a new conventional wisdom to help vitriolic
columnists like Sowell ignore land values? <a

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Another resource-consumptive segment of the
economy is <span style="font-weight: bold;">construction</span>.
Developers now profit from value. Losing that to land dues, they'd seek
a replacement income. They'd be inclined to use cheaper recycled
materials and build homes of higher value, with more insulation, heat
exchangers, light tubes, rain cachements, a front for the street and a
face for the south, fiber-optic wiring for the computerized building,
edible landscaping, etc.<br>
<br>
Many building codes mandate certain features (thick insulation, smoke
detectors, etc). All these add-ons raise improvement value which the
polity then taxes. The PTS repeals the penalty for improving
structures. Another current obstacle to more efficient construction is
that renters, unlike owners, have little vested interest in upgrading
the structure. Lower land prices put more people into their own homes.
As owner occupants, people tend to be more motivated to plug heat leaks
and conserve energy, thereby slowing climate change. <strong>... </strong></small></font><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<font size="3"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First-time home
buyers make out like bandits. They'd pay a higher
land dues to their community but lower total taxes to government, a
lower price to the seller, and a lower mortgage to the lender. Is it
fair that one group should benefit so prodigiously? Yes.</span> In many
US
cities, renters now outnumber owners. High rates of tenancy, as shown
in Goldschmidt's 1940s study of the Central California towns Arvin and
Dinuba, engender apathy and indifference, which are bad for democracy,
community involvement, street safety, and environmental protection. The
sooner young families can become homeowners, the better off all members
of society will be.<br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">What To Do About the
Real Estate Bubble</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What&#8217;s bubbling, and until when?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Sellers are happy. So are developers and speculators. Real estate has
gone all bubbly, and that bubble has gone ballistic. What goes up,
however, must soon do something else. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Actually, it&#8217;s not housing whose price has entered the
stratosphere. Buildings age &#8211; get older, more worn out. What&#8217;s getting
more valuable is the land, the location &#8211; whether it has a building on
it or not. Buildings you can make more of, but land you can not,
especially locations along the coasts or on the good side of town. None
of that would matter if you could ever get buildings to hover around in
the air. Meanwhile however, speculators are happy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... What&#8217;s seemingly good for landowners is not necessarily good
for the economy. As people spend more on land, something nobody
produced, they spend less on output, things people do produce. As
producers get less money spent on their products, eventually they take
the hint and produce less. "Produce less" is another way of spelling
recession.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Plus, more expensive land means heavier borrowing to buy it.
More debt means more inflation and less stability. When producers cut
back, borrowers have a much harder time paying back their debts. As
people go bankrupt, they drag others down with them. A collapsing house
of cards is another way of spelling depression.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preventing bubbles?</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If land values didn&#8217;t get
inflated, of
course they would not have to get deflated.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Call it mutual compensation for
deprivation from part of our common natural heritage. </span> While in
rhythmic
systems, prices must rise and fall, but they need not boom then bust;
they could climb then glide. What would temper economies, preventing
bubbles? Rather than let a few lucky owners collect land values,
neighbors would have to recover land values for themselves. Nobody made
land, and no lone owner made its value; the presence of society in
general did that. Plus, for excluding everyone else from their sites,
owners owe everyone else, as each one of us owes everyone for excluding
them. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To recover land value,
government
could either transform the property tax into a land tax or replace it
and other taxes with land dues or land use fees or an annual deed fee.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To pay the land dues, owners use their
land efficiently; owners who had been speculating get busy and develop.</span>
No longer allowed to tax anything that moves, local governments, too,
which presently let acres of abandoned urban land and buildings lie
fallow, get busy, too, and make sure to get those acres into the hands
of ambitious owners who&#8217;ll pay land dues. More locations put to use and
more buildings put up increases supply, which dampens price.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Better still, as government recovers
land rent, that leaves owners with less land rent to capitalize into
land price. Hence buyers need not borrow so much.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Land would still rise in value. With
every discovery of a nearby natural resource. With the opening of every
new bridge. With every techno-advance, as silicon wafers did for
Silicon Valley. With every jump in income and drop in crime, land value
rises. But no longer into a bubble. Because every rise would find its
way &#8211; via land dues and rent dividends &#8211; into everyone&#8217;s pockets. <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>
If the 18-year average holds for this cycle, then real estate still has
a few more years of sucking all the investments and purchasing power
out of the rest of the economy. Land is still able to soak it all up,
and lenders are still willing to pump more in. So despite the premature
panic (markets almost never do what everybody says they&#8217;re going to
do), Mankiw&#8217;s 2007 would be the earliest that the current bubble would
burst, and 2008 is just as likely.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Then land prices will fall for a few years. Since the run-up was steep,
the drop will be, too &#8211; after correcting for inflation, maybe as much
as 50%. Which will be an enormous relief for the economy &#8211; just what
the doctor ordered. With land affordable again, a new cycle can get
under way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether the new one will
be boom and bust or climb and glide is up to us, whether we&#8217;re willing
to practice geonomics, to forego taxes and subsidies in favor of land
dues and a Citizens Dividend.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While I don&#8217;t mind the current
gambling, I do mind the widening of the cavernous gulf between haves
and have-nots, and I boil over while workweek grows more onerous, and
just seethe watching vacant lots and abandoned buildings push
development out from urban cores to sprawl on suburban farmland. To
reverse that, let&#8217;s let go of the individual owner&#8217;s hold on land rent
and share Earth&#8217;s worth equitably among us all. We&#8217;ll all be glad we
did. </span>...<a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">&nbsp; <big><big><small><small><span

Herbert J. G. Bab:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Bab_PT_Unemployment.html">Property
Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a> -- circa 1964<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The steep increase in the level
of rentals represents a true and
accurate yardstick of our housing shortage. During the period 1950 to
1961</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the average rental rose from $71.13 per month to $186.79
or by
160%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>During the same period median urban family income rose
from
$3,497 to $5,924 or by only 69%.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></li>
  <li><small>Construction costs per square foot rose
from $8.68 in 1950 to $11.32 in 1961 or by only 30.4%.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The ever widening gap between
the level of rentals and the urban family income constitutes a rental
squeeze, which has brought untold misery and hardship to families in
the lower income group, especially to those belonging to minority
groups. The rental squeeze has also aggravated overcrowding and slum
conditions. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A
defect
of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small>This characteristic of the property tax is obscured by the
rising
trends of land values, which in many cases offset the loss in value of
the improvement. Increases in tax rates and differences in assessment
procedures and practices further hide the fact that ad valorem taxes
favor obsolete real property.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let us now turn to that part of
the
tax that is assessed on land. </span>Increases in population,
immigration from the farms and other forces have led to a rapid
increase in the population of our large cities and metropolitan areas. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Population
pressure is bound to increase the value of urban land. Yet an adequate
system of land taxation could have prevented the steep rise in urban
land values.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are
capitalized. For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have
an imputed or expected income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of
capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad valorem" tax would reduce the
imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax would naturally reduce the
value of the land by the same percentage.</small><br>
<br>
<small>For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by
taxing land at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have
increased tremendously during recent years. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For instance in Los Angeles county the
assessed value of land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002
millions in 1962, an increase of a little over 100%. </span>The
assessed values, are supposed to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the unearned increment in land values
during this period amounted to not less than $8 billions.</span> Even
this figure is an understatement because it is based on assessed values
and land is greatly underassessed. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While land
values have risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land
averaged about 1.5%. Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land
would have earned about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from
its proper use.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>A higher tax on vacant or unimproved land would make it
unprofitable to
hold such lands. It will tax land into better use and it will lead to a
spurt in construction activity. While all other taxes are deterrents to
employment and economic growth, though to a varying extent, land taxes
are the only genuine incentive taxes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inflated land values must
necessarily
increase the cost of new homes, the cost of home-ownership and rentals.</span>
It discourages residential construction, prices many families out of
the housing market and aggravates the housing shortage. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Homeowners who bought their homes some time in the past can reap
large
profits when selling them. Old homes should sell at a lower price,
because of the depreciation of the building, but in most cases the
depreciation of the building is more than offset by the increased value
of the lot. This increased value forces buyers to increase their down
payments or to increase their loan are higher, many families are priced
out of the market.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We have discussed the sharp increase in the level of rents that
has
taken place during these last years. These increases reflect the steep
rise in land values that have taken place in almost all sections of our
cities. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
tax assessed on the improvements has discouraged the construction of
more and better housing. At the same time, the tax assessed on land has
been too low to induce owners to sell, improve, or replace their rental
properties.</span></small><small>... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on
improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not
identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
paradox of property taxation
consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
improvements produce the same results as lower rates on land.</span></small> <small><small><small><big><big><a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p><a href="../docs/unindexed/FordH_1942.htm">Henry Ford Talks About War and
    Your Future</a> - 1942 interview </p>
<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
      that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
      to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use in an urban
      context is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who gets
      the principal benefits from urban economic growth. Its ownership is a major
      determinant of the degree of economic inequality: surges of land prices,
      such as have occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause
      major redistributions of wealth. In both an urban and rural context the
      use of land &#8211; and nature more generally &#8211; is central to the
      possibility of ecological sustainability. <strong>Contemporary social concerns
      about problems of housing affordability and environmental quality necessarily
      focus our attention on &#8216;the land question.&#8217; ...</strong></p>
    <p>While still ignored by the economic orthodoxy, interest in George&#8217;s
      work has been stimulated by modern concerns about housing affordability
      and environmental decay. Such revival of interest recognises that these
      problems stem, in part, from inadequate policies relating to land. Some
      members of Green parties, in particular, have embraced Georgist ideas.
      <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
    <p>A third aspect in this &#8216;stocktaking&#8217; of the relevance of Georgist
      analysis and policy to contemporary political economic conditions concerns
      the persistent problems of housing affordability. The difficulty of purchasing,
      or renting, affordable housing has reached social crisis proportions in
      many large cities around the world. In Sydney, for example, a median-priced
      house could be bought for just under four years of average Australian earnings
      in 1986, but an equivalent house in 2003 cost over twelve years&#8217; worth
      of earnings (Stilwell, 2003). This constitutes an enormous barrier to home-ownership
      for a younger generation, a problem that both Federal and State Governments
      have sought to redress by the provision of first home-buyers&#8217; subsidies.
      It is not typically the house itself that has been the cause of the inflation,
      but the price of the land on which it stands. So, looking at the situation
      from a Georgist perspective immediately directs our attention to how the
      demand and supply of land affects housing affordability.</p>
    <p>        The demand for land involves both use values and exchange values. People
        seek land because the housing built on it provides shelter and security,
        but they also purchase it as a store of wealth and a means of capital
          appreciation. A particularly important driver of real estate prices
          has been the speculative
        demand, as investors seek capital gains in the property market. In Australia,
        this has been such common and longstanding practice that it has been
          referred to as &#8216;the national hobby&#8217; (Sandercock, 1979). By &#8216;creaming
        off&#8217; a part of this potential capital gain, a higher uniform rate
        of land tax would act as a disincentive to this property speculation, and
        could therefore be expected to exert a downward influence on property prices.
        Georgists have always been emphatic that land taxes are different from
        other taxes in this respect &#8211; they depress prices because they reduce
        demand. So the usual fears that a tax will be &#8216;passed on&#8217; to
        customers (such as housing tenants, in this case) do not apply. By making
        land less attractive as an item to be purchased in the hope of making capital
        gains, land tax can therefore be an important check on the inflationary
        process.</p>
    <p>However, while a higher uniform land tax could be an important component
        in a policy addressing housing affordability, it seems unlikely to provide
        a complete solution. The severity of the housing problem in Australia,
        for example, also derives partly from the dwindling supply of public
      housing. Public housing is now less than 5% of the total housing stock
      and falling
        (National Housing Alliance, 2004: 5). Governments have withdrawn funds
        from public housing and tightened entry requirements (for example, lowering
        the threshold for the means test). This has caused public housing waiting
        lists to lengthen and put greater pressure on the private rental sector.
        More and more people have been forced into circumstances of significant &#8216;housing
        stress,&#8217; paying a third or more of their net income for housing
        (Hawtrey, 2002), and further adding to inflationary pressures on housing
        prices.</p>
    <p>There is a potentially important link between these concerns &#8211; land
      tax and public housing &#8211; because a higher, more uniform land tax
      could generate revenue to finance a significantly larger public housing
      sector. That would, in effect, kill two birds with one stone, providing
      the twin basis for an assault on the problem of housing affordability. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>
