    <blockquote>
      <p>Q: Your academic work led you to formulate what you called &quot;The
        Henry George Theorem.&quot; This demonstrated that public spending &#8212; where
        this was efficient &#8212; generated additional rental value that surfaced
        in the land market. Other distinguished scholars, such as the late Nobel
        prize winner, William Vickrey, confirmed your findings. You also noted
        in one of your books, co-written with Anthony Atkinson, that the Henry
        George Theorem was attractive both because it was the revenue-raiser
        that did not distort private incentives and because &quot;it is the 'single
        tax' required to finance the public good.&quot; [Anthony B. Atkinson &amp; Joseph
        E. Stiglitz, Lectures on Public Economics, London: McGraw-Hill, 1980,
        p. 525] Now, public investment, unless of the wasteful kind designed
        to serve the privileged interests of rent seekers (the classic type being
        a land speculator), should be viewed as working in partnership with the
        private sector and not a drain on the community. How can the reputation
        of publicly provided services and investments be rescued?</p>
      <p>JES: That's a very good question. What we did when I was at the Council
        of Economic Advisors was some studies to try to show what the social
        returns would be to public investment in R&amp;D, etc. And we became
        convinced that the rates of return of those investments are very high.
        So you ask the question, &quot;what can we do to restore confidence in
        public investment?&quot; We need to realize how much we depend on them.
        I keep telling people, &quot;The Internet.&quot; That's one example.
        It was publicly funded. It's now a public-private partnership. The government
        did the basic research, and the private sector ran off with it. But,
        arguably, we would never have had the Internet if it were not for government
        expenditure. So I think a major industry in the United States &#8212; biotech &#8212; is
        based on NIH (National Institutes of Health). NIH does all the basic
        research. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

      <p>The tax reform presented here is not new. It has been working to some
              degree in many cities and countries around the world. The idea probably
              obtained its greatest popularity in the U.S. in the late 1800s, when the
              economist Henry George analyzed taxing land value and untaxing labor and
              capital in his book, Progress and Poverty.</p>

      <p>Many economists have since then expanded on
        George&#8217;s writing, examining
              both the theory and the evidence. There is even a &#8220;Henry George Theorem,&#8221; which
              proves that in a community with optimal population, the land rent equals
              the value of the community&#8217;s public goods. Modern economics thus
              affirms George&#8217;s theory in a more comprehensive and more
              rigorous form, although the empirical question of how much revenue
              could be
              obtained from rent would benefit from more research. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

            <p>Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The Morality of Taxation:
            The Local Case</a>        </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From a moral perspective, taxation
            is dubious or worse. We tell
            our fellow citizens that if they do not pay taxes that we say they
            owe, their property will be seized or they will be sent to prison.
          Why do we treat people this way? Is there a justification?</small></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The dubiousness of taxation
            increases when we consider its
            origins. Government seems to have originated as roving bandits who
            learned that total destruction was less profitable than protecting
            their victims from other bandits and allowing them to keep a fraction
            of what they produced (Olson, 1993). In time, scheduled partial
            plunder evolved into taxation. Over the centuries, regimes that
            started as tyrannies evolved into democracies. The public sector
            evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will of despots into a
            mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions. But public finance
            continues to rely on the power of tax collectors, developed under
            early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The wrath that
            citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the strongest
            antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a governmental
          institution. Why do we allow ourselves to do this to one another?</small></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a gentler side of
            taxation that provides some explanation
            of our tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that
            people achieve their common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so
            that there will be money to pay for public services that they want.
            From this perspective, taxation may be considered no more than the
            dues for belonging to a club that provides people with things that
            they would rather pay their share of than do without. However, to
            make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people
            must be able to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to
            be a citizen of the taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by
          some taxing jurisdiction, the choice isn't exactly free.</small></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The problem of morality in
            taxation is the following: 
        </small></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>How do we
          retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions to the
          cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
          the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
          of plunder? 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly
          impose on our fellow citizens? 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>And how do we set up a structure of
          government that will ensure that these limits are observed? <strong>...
            </strong></small></li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>we would probably have a much
            more efficient public sector if
            every public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative
          bodies.</small></div>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But to make taxation truly
            voluntary, the option to leave must be
            viable. If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to
            another, taking all of their belongings with them, then competition
            among jurisdictions would tend to eliminate oppressive taxation. This
            would leave only the fees that people were prepared to pay to have
          public services (Tiebout, 1956).</small></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, moving will always have
            some costs, so the ideal will
            not be attainable. But what can be imagined is a system in which all
            taxes were local taxes. Then people would not have to move nearly as
            far to escape from taxes that they regarded as oppressive. Higher
            levels of government would not need to disappear; if the services
            that they provide are desired, they could be financed by levies on
            lower levels of government. <strong>... 
        </strong></small></p>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...Thus communities would not be
            able to raise much revenue from income
            tax or taxes on capital before they would drive residents and
            investment away. It might seem that there would be no way that
          localities could finance themselves.</small></div>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Such a conclusion would be
            unwarranted, because <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is a very
            significant source of public revenue that can survive when localities
            compete for mobile residents. This source is land. When people are
            taxed in proportion to the land they possess</span>, no land moves to
            another locality where taxes are lower. Thus two questions arise:
            
</small></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>Would taxes on land be sufficient to finance the public
          activities
          that ought to be undertaken, and 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>would such a system be fair?</small></li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <p><small>Consider first the question of adequacy of revenue. There is
            a
            theorem in economics, known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
            Henry George Theorem</span>, that
            addresses this question (Arnott and Stiglitz, 1979). One of the
            simpler versions of this theorem is: </small></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the following three conditions
            are met:</small></p>
            <blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1. Public expenditures
            provide benefits only over a limited area, <br>
            2. People can move costlessly, and <br>
            3. The number of persons who value a public service as highly as anyone
            does exceeds the number of persons who can live in the area where the
            service provides benefits, 
            </small></blockquote>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>then for any public service that
            is worth at least as much as it costs to those who receive it, the
            increase in the rental value of land that results from providing the
            service exceeds the net cost of the service.</small></p>
            <small>The Henry George Theorem is true because people who can move
            costlessly will bid up the rental value of land to reflect the value
            of public services that are not available elsewhere. The assumption
            that the number of bidders exceeds the number of people who can
            benefit from the public service guarantees that the upward movement
            of rents will not end until all the benefits of the public service
            are reflected in these rents. If some people who receive a public
            service value it more highly than others, then they will receive a
            surplus in addition to the rent they pay for land, and some
            worthwhile increments of public services will not add quite enough to
            rent to pay for themselves (Tideman 1993). But rent increments will
            go a very long way toward paying for worthwhile local public
            services.

        </small>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Textbooks in public finance and
        urban economics sometimes contain a
        topic known as the &#8220;Henry George Theorem.&#8221; It states that the public
        revenue that provides for the collective goods of an optimally-sized
        community equals the land rent of that community. As presented in
        Atkinson and Stiglitz (1987, 523-5), the representative agent&#8217;s utility
        function is U(G,X), where G is a collective and X a private good.
        Output Y is a function of N workers:</small><br>
        <br>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Y = f(N) = XN + G.<br>
        X = {f(N)-G} / N<br>
        The wage is the marginal product of labor:<br>
&#8706;f/&#8706;N = X<br>
        Therefore,<br>
&#8706;f/&#8706;N = {(f(N)-G)/N}<br>
        G = f(N) - Nf&#8217;(N)
        </small></div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
        <small>With land and labor the ultimate and original factors of
        production,
        rent (R) is the difference between total product Y and total wages:</small><br>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>R = f(N) - Nf'(N)
        </small></div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
        <small>Therefore,</small><br>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>R = G.<br>
        </small></div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Henry George Theorem is so
        named because it echoes Henry George's
        (1879) single-tax proposal, that not only should land rent be the only
        general tax, but that it will be adequate to finance public goods. The
        theorem is accepted in public finance, but it is not applied. In
        upper-level public-economics textbooks such as Atkinson and Stiglitz
        (1987), it is presented, yet not invoked in policy discussions, and it
        is ignored in scholarly treatments of optimal taxation, tax reform, and
        public policy.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Edwin Mills (1998) goes further and constructs a comparative
        static
        model of a metropolis using a Cobb-Douglas production function with
        three factors, the third being land, which is a refreshing change from
        the usual two-factor analysis that tucks land into capital and then
        forgets that it&#8217;s there. One theorem of the model is that a land-value
        tax has no effect on resource allocation. Yet he concludes (47) that
        despite is theoretical attractiveness a significant taxing of geo-rent
        would deprive the owners of their beneficial uses, and would require
        compensation, leaving the tax &#8220;practically almost worthless&#8221; (47, 41).</small><br>
        <small>Thomas Nechyba (1998) also has a model with land, calibrated to
        U.S.
        parameters. He shows that replacing taxes on capital with taxes on land
        can actually increase land values, despite the downward capitalization
        caused by the tax, because of the greater increase in capital and rent.
        According to the model (p. 196), with an elasticity of substitution
        between capital and land of 0.5, which is within the estimated range, a
        revenue-neutral tax shift to land value increases capital goods by 122
        percent and raises output by 89 percent. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>&quot;One of the most celebrated results in
            urban economics is the Henry George Theorem. The best-known variant
            of the Theorem states that in
                a city of optimal population size, where the source of agglomeration
                is a localized pure public good, urban (differential) land rents
            equal expenditure on the public good. Thus, a confiscatory tax on land
            rents
                is the single tax necessary to finance the public good. The explanation
                for the result is as follows: In a city of optimal population size,
                the average social cost of providing residents with a given level
            of utility is minimized. At the point of minimum average cost, there
            are
                locally constant returns to scale so that the product exhaustion
            theorem holds. With marginal-cost pricing, the profits generated from
            the decreasing
                returns to scale activities equal the losses fro mthe increasing
            returns to scale activities. In the current contect, the profits take
            the form
                of land rents and the loss is the expenditure on the local public
            good. The Henry George Theorem was discovered independently by Serck-Hansen
                (1969), Starrett (1974), Flatters, Henderson and Mieszkowski (1974),
                and Vickrey. Vickrey delayed publication and was the last into
            print.
                Unfortunately, therefore, his 1977 paper on the Theorem, &quot;<em>The
                City as a Firm</em>&quot; (chapter 17), has not received the recognition it deserves.
                In any event, the paper provides an elegant formulation of a variant
                of the Theorem and an insightful explanation and discussion of
            it.&quot;</p>
          <p>the Summary to Vickrey's &quot;<em>The City as a Firm</em>&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;While it is dangerous to extrapolate too freely from admittedly
            oversimplified and even caricatured models (such as the above) to
            the complexities of the real world, it seems not too rash to draw
            the conclution that urban land rents are, fundamentally, a reflection
            of the economies of scale of the activites that are carried on within
            the city, and that efficient organization of a city, or even of the
            urban life of a nation as a whole, requires that these land rents,
            or their equivalent, be devoted primarily to the finacing of the
            intramarginal residues that represent the difference between revenues
            derived from prices set at marginal cost and the total cost of the
            activites characterized by increasing returns. This means that revenues
            derived from these rents must defray not only those overhead costs
            of government and public services that are not marginally attributable
            to specific outputs, but also the intramarginal elements of most
            public utility costs, as well as thoser of a considerable range of
            activities ordinarily thought of as belonging to the private sector.
            Such a subsidy is especially crucial for mass transit and for other
            forms of transportation where economies of scale are significant,
            given the special relationship existing between transportation and
            land values. </p>
          <p>Use of land rents, or, at least, of a major fraction of them, for
            public purposes is therefore not merely an ethical imperative, derived
            from categorization of these retns as an unearned income derived
            from private appropriation of publicly created values, but is, even
            more importantly, a fundamental requirement for economic efficiency.
            Cities that take the lead in such public use of land rents may find
            that in the long run the subsidy is self-financing through the enhancement
            in land values that results, while cities that lag may find that
            in the long run they are unable to compete in national or world markets
            with the cities that manage to organize themselves more efficiently
            through the use of land rents to cover intramarginal residues. There
            will, of course, be many an agonizing slip between abstract economic
            analysis and cold political and economic reality. Lack of comprehension,
            political intervention, strategic recalcitrance, and the inertia
            associated with heavy commitments of fixed capital in what the French
            so aptly term <em>immeubles</em> may slow the processes involved
            to a glacial pace. But the fundamental tendencies and requirements
            inherent in the very nature of the city can be ignored only at great
            peril to its economic health.&quot;</p>

          <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
              of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
          Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may
              alter with altering conditions, the same principles of right and
              wrong that hold when men are few and industry is rude also hold
              amid teeming populations and complex industries. In our cities
              of millions and our states of scores of millions, in a civilization
              where the division of labor has gone so far that large numbers
              are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains
              true that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and
              that land is God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be
              deprived without being murdered, and for which no one can be compelled
              to pay another without being robbed. But even in a state of society
              where the elaboration of industry and the increase of permanent
              improvements have made the need for private possession of land
              wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual possession
              with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
              will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar
              labor on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when
              it is sold or rented. Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective
              of the value of any improvements in or on it, always indicates
              the precise value of the benefit to which all are entitled in its
              use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer or successor
            of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
            <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice
              of common ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for
              common uses what value attaches to land irrespective of any exertion
              of labor on it. The principle is the same as in the case referred
              to, where a human father leaves equally to his children things
              not susceptible of specific division or common use. In that case
              such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
            <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves
              single-tax men, would have the community act.</p>
            <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land
              common, letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not
              propose the task, impossible in the present state of society, of
              dividing land in equal shares; still less the yet more impossible
              task of keeping it so divided.</p>
            <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
              with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
              to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual
              value of the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or
              the improvements on it. <strong>And since this would provide amply
              for the need of public revenues, we would accompany this tax on
              land
              values with the repeal of all taxes now levied on the products
              and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since they take
              from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
              right of property.</strong></p>
            <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but
              as a conforming of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
            <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws
              that clash.</p>
            <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
              is to say, that they should respect the right of property which
              each one has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
            <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty
              has intended all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
            <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate,
              there must be some way in which the exclusive right to the products
              of industry may be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
            <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say
              those socialists referred to by you, that in order to secure the
              equal participation of men in the opportunities of life and labor
              we must ignore the right of private property. Nor yet can it be,
              as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue, that to secure
              the right of private property we must ignore the equality of right
              in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
              the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
            <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to
              the community of the value of any special advantage thus given
              to the individual, satisfies both laws, securing to all equal participation
              in the bounty of the Creator and to each the full ownership of
              the products of his labor.</p>
