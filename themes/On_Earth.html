  <p>How do we defend our current way of doing things &#8212; what we tax and

</blockquote>
<p>Mason Gaffney <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">on Bill Vickrey</a>
    ...</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The evening of the day Bill
Vickrey won his Nobel I impulsively,
hesitantly dialed his home. His phone surprised me by ringing unbusy,
and Bill surprised me more by answering, and sounding unhurried.
After congratulations, I asked "Bill, was this for a lifetime of
achievement, or some specific work?" "I don't know," he replied.
"Well," I persisted, "Is there a citation? What does it say?" "Yes,"
he said, "there is one, but I can't understand it." If you and I find
it a puzzle, we have good company.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The last
thing he asked me before hanging up was, "Will I see you at the <a
 href="../docs/tred.html">TRED</a></small><a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/TRED.html">
</a><small>meeting?" Bill never missed. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Bill died, as you know by now, en route to that meeting. He
drove
at night, true to his principle of easing peak-hour congestion. Had
he arrived, I know he would have raised his head from the doze he
affected and told some unwary journeyman, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">"This paper would benefit
from an application of Henry George's idea of taxing land values."
</span>How do I know? Because he always did.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> I imagine by now he has
mentioned it to God, too; and God has said "Actually, Bill, that's
how we've always done it here; but thank you for urging folks to have
my will done on earth as it is in Heaven."</span></small></div>

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy Kingdom Come</a>
(1889 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have just joined in the most
solemn, the most sacred, the most
catholic of all prayers: &#8220;Our Father which art in Heaven!&#8221;
To all of us who have learned it in our infancy, it oft calls up the
sweetest and most tender emotions. Sometimes with feeling, sometimes
as a matter of course, how often have we repeated it? For centuries,
daily, hourly, has that prayer gone up. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; Has it come?
Let this Christian
city of Glasgow answer &#8212; Glasgow, that was to &#8220;Flourish by
the preaching of the word&#8221;. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; Day after
day, Sunday after
Sunday, week after week, century after century, has that prayer gone
up; and today, in this so-called Christian city of Glasgow, 125,000
human beings &#8212; so your medical officer says &#8212; 125,000
children of God are living whole families in a single room. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; We have been
praying for it and
praying for it, yet it has not come. So long has it tarried that many
think it will never come. Here is the vital point in which what we
are accustomed to call the Christianity of the present day differs so
much from that Christianity which overran the ancient world &#8212;
that Christianity which, beneath a rotten old civilisation, planted
the seeds of a newer and a higher. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We have become accustomed to
think that God&#8217;s kingdom, is
not intended for this world; that, virtually, this is the
devil&#8217;s world, and that God&#8217;s kingdom is in some other
sphere, to which He is to take good people when they die &#8212; as
good Americans are said when they die to go to Paris. If that be so,
what is the use of praying for the coming of the kingdom? Is God the
loving Father of whom Christ told &#8212; is He a God of that kind; a
God who looks on this world, sees its sufferings and its miseries,
sees high faculties aborted, lives stunted, innocence turned to vice
and crime, and heartstrings strained and broken, yet, having it in
His power, will not bring that kingdom of peace, and love, and plenty
and happiness? Is God indeed a self-willed despot, whom we must coax
to do the good He might? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of it. The Almighty &#8212; and I
say it with reverence
&#8212; the Almighty could not bring that kingdom of Himself. For,
what is the kingdom of God; the kingdom that Christ taught us to pray
for? Is it not in the doing of God&#8217;s will, not by automata, not
by animals who are compelled, but by intelligent beings clothed with
free will, intelligent beings knowing good from evil?<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&#8220;Our Father!&#8221; &#8220;Our Father!&#8221;
Whose? Not <span style="font-style: italic;">my
</span>Father &#8212; that is not the prayer. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Our </span>Father&#8221; &#8212;
not the father of any sect, or any class, but the Father of all
humanity. The All-Father, the equal Father, the loving Father. He it
is we ask to bring the kingdom. Aye, we ask it with our lips! We call
Him &#8220;Our Father,&#8221; the All, the Universal Father, when we
kneel down to pray to Him. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that He is the All-Father &#8212;
that He is all
people&#8217;s Father &#8212; we deny by our institutions. The
All-Father who made the world, the All-Father who created us in His
image, and put us upon the earth to draw subsistence from its bosom;
to find in the earth all the materials that satisfy our wants,
waiting only to be worked up by our labour! If He is the All-Father,
then are not all human beings, all children of the Creator, equally
entitled to the use of His bounty? And, yet, our laws say that this
God&#8217;s earth is not here for the use of all His children, but
only for the use of a privileged few!<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Think of what Christianity
teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Mr Abner Thomas, of New York, a
strict orthodox Presbyterian
&#8212; and the son of Rev Dr Thomas, author of a commentary on the
bible &#8212;wrote a little while ago an allegory. Dozing off in his
chair, he dreamt that he was ferried over the River of Death, and,
taking the straight and narrow way, came at last within sight of the
Golden City. A fine-looking old gentleman angel opened the wicket,
inquired his name, and let him in; warning him, at the same time,
that it would be better if he chose his company in heaven, and did
not associate with disreputable angels. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What!&#8221; said the newcomer, in
astonishment: &#8220;Is
not this heaven?&#8221; <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said the
warden. &#8220;That
property belongs to one of our most far-sighted angels who has got
very rich by the advance of land values, and who is holding that
piece for a rise. You will have to buy it or rent it before you can
work on it, and you can&#8217;t do that yet.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The story goes on to describe how
the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Really, if we could imagine it,
it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come.&#8221; No one can
think of the kingdom
for which the prayer asks without feeling that it must be a kingdom
of justice and equality &#8212; not necessarily of equality in
condition, but of equality in opportunity. And no one can think of it
without seeing that a very kingdom of God might be brought on this
earth if people would but seek to do justice &#8212; if people would
but acknowledge the essential principle of Christianity, that of
doing to others as we would have others do to us, and of recognising
that we are all here equally the children of the one Father, equally
entitled to share His bounty, equally entitled to live our lives and
develop our faculties, and to apply our labour to the raw material
that He has provided. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Aye! When a person sees that,
then there arises that hope of the
coming of the kingdom that carried the gospel through the streets of
Rome, that carried it into pagan lands, that made it, against the
most ferocious persecution, the dominant religion of the world.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> And, instead of preaching the
essential Fatherhood of God, the
essential brotherhood and sisterhood of humankind, its high priests
grafted onto the pure truths of the gospel the blasphemous doctrine
that the All-Father is a respecter of persons, and that by His will
and on His mandate is founded that monstrous injustice which condemns
the great mass of humanity to unrequited hard toil. There has been no
failure of Christianity. The failure has been in the sort of
Christianity that has been preached. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Nothing is clearer than that if
we are all children of the
universal Father, we are all entitled to the use of His bounty. No
one dare deny that proposition. But the people who set their faces
against its carrying out say, virtually: &#8220;Oh, yes! that is true;
but it is impracticable to carry it into effect!&#8221; Just think of
what this means. This is God&#8217;s world, and yet such people say
that it is a world in which God&#8217;s justice, God&#8217;s will,
cannot be carried into effect. What a monstrous absurdity, what a
monstrous blasphemy! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If the loving God does reign, if
His laws are the laws not
merely of the physical, but of the moral universe, there must be a
way of carrying His will into effect, there must be a way of doing
equal justice to all of His creatures. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There is. The people who deny
that there is any practical way of
carrying into effect the perception that all human beings are equally
children of the Creator shut their eyes to the plain and obvious way.
It is, of course, impossible in a civilisation like this of ours to
divide land up into equal pieces. Such a system might have done in a
primitive state of society. We have progressed in civilisation beyond
such rude devices, but we have not, nor can we, progress beyond
God&#8217;s providence. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There is a way of securing the
equal rights of all, not by
dividing land up into equal pieces, but by taking for the use of all
that value which attaches to land, not as the result of individual
labour upon it, but as the result of the increase in population, and
the improvement of society. In that way everyone would be equally
interested in the land of one&#8217;s native country. Here is the
simple way. It is a way that impresses the person who really sees its
beauty with a more vivid idea of the beneficence of the providence of
the All-Father than, it seems to me, does anything else. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> One cannot look, it seems to me,
through nature &#8212; whether
one looks at the stars through a telescope, or have the microscope
reveal to one those worlds that we find in drops of water. Whether
one considers the human frame, the adjustments of the animal kingdom,
or any department of physical nature, one must see that there has
been a contriver and adjuster, that there has been an intent. So
strong is that feeling, so natural is it to our minds, that even
people who deny the Creative Intelligence are forced, in spite of
themselves, to talk of intent; the claws on one animal were intended,
we say, to climb with, the fins of another to propel it through the
water. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Yet, while in looking through the
laws of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical </span>nature, we
find intelligence we do not so clearly find beneficence. But in the
great <span style="font-style: italic;">social </span>fact that as
population increases, and improvements are
made, and men progress in civilisation, the one thing that rises
everywhere in value is land, and in this we may see a proof of the
beneficence of the Creator. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider what it means! It
means that the social laws are
adapted to progressive humanity! In a rude state of society where
there is no need for common expenditure, there is no value attaching
to land. The only value which attaches there is to things produced by
labour. But as civilisation goes on, as a division of labour takes
place, as people come into centres, so do the common wants increase,
and so does the necessity for public revenue arise. And so in that
value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the
individual does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a
provision intended &#8212; we may safely say intended &#8212; to meet
that social want. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Just as society grows, so do the
common needs grow, and so grows
this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided fund from which they
can be supplied. Here is a value that may be taken, without impairing
the right of property, without taking anything from the producer,
without lessening the natural rewards of industry and thrift. Nay,
here is a value that <span style="font-style: italic;">must </span>be
taken if we would prevent the most
monstrous of all monopolies. What does all this mean? It means that
in the creative plan, the natural advance in civilisation is an
advance to a greater and greater equality instead of to a more and
more monstrous inequality. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; It may be
that we shall never see
it. But to those people who realise that it may come, to those who
realise that it is given to them to work for the coming of God&#8217;s
kingdom on earth, there is for them, though they never see that
kingdom here, an exceedingly great reward &#8212; the reward of
feeling that they, little and insignificant though they may be, are
doing something to help the coming of that kingdom, doing something
on the side of that Good Power that shows all through the universe,
doing something to tear this world from the devil&#8217;s grasp and
make it the kingdom of righteousness. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Aye, and though it should never
come, yet those who struggle for
it know in the depths of their hearts that it must exist somewhere
&#8212; they know that, somewhere, sometime, those who strive their
best for the coming of the kingdom will be welcomed into the kingdom,
and that to them, even to them, sometime, somewhere, the King shall
say: &#8220;Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into
the joy of thy Lord.&#8221; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Henry George: <a href="../HG/Ode_to_Liberty.html">Ode to
Liberty&nbsp;</a> (1877 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one
man to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we
have made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material
progress goes on. This is the subtle alchemy that in ways they do not
realize is extracting from the masses in every civilized country the
fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting a harder and more
hopeless slavery in place of that which has been destroyed; that is
bringing political despotism out of political freedom, and must soon
transmute democratic institutions into anarchy. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Though it may take the language of
prayer, it is blasphemy that
attributes to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering
and brutishness that come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to
the All-Father and lays on Him the responsibility for the want and
crime of our great cities. We degrade the Everlasting. We slander the
Just One.</span> A merciful man would have better ordered the world; a
just
man would crush with his foot such an ulcerous ant-hill!<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> It is not
the Almighty, but we who are responsible for the vice and misery that
fester amid our civilization. </span>The Creator showers upon us his
gifts &#8212; more than enough for all. But like swine scrambling for
food, we tread them in the mire &#8212; tread them in the mire, while we
tear and rend each other! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> In the very centers of our
civilization today are want and
suffering enough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his
eyes and steel his nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to
relieve it? Supposing the prayer were heard, and at the behest with
which the universe sprang into being there should glow in the sun a
greater power; new virtue fill the air; fresh vigor the soil; that
for every blade of grass that now grows two should spring up, and the
seed that now increases fifty-fold should increase a hundredfold!
Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever
benefit would accrue would be but temporary. The new powers streaming
through the material universe could be utilized only through land.
And land, being private property, the classes that now monopolize the
bounty of the Creator would monopolize all the new bounty. Land
owners would alone be benefited. Rents would increase, but wages
would still tend to the starvation point! <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
But if, while there is yet time, we
turn to Justice and obey
her, if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now
threaten must disappear, the forces that now menace will turn to
agencies of elevation.</span> Think of the powers now wasted; of the
infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored; of the possibilities
of which the wondrous inventions of this century give us but a hint.
With want destroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with the
fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the jealousy
and fear that now array men against each other; with mental power
loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure;
and who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar?
Words fail the thought! It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung
and high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious
vision which has always haunted man with gleams of fitful splendor.
It is what he saw whose eyes at Patmos were closed in a trance. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It is
the culmination of Christianity &#8212; the City of God on earth, with
its walls of jasper and its gates of pearl! It is the reign of the
Prince of Peace! </span>... <a href="../HG/Ode_to_Liberty.html"><span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chattel slavery was incarnate
theft of the worst kind. That system which made property of human
beings, which allowed one person to sell another, which allowed one
person to take away the proceeds of another&#8217;s toil, which permitted the
tearing of the child from the mother, and which permitted the so-called
owner to hunt with bloodhounds the person who escaped from the owner&#8217;s
tyranny &#8212; that form of slavery is abolished. To that extent, the
command, "Thou shalt not steal," has been vindicated; but there is
another form of slavery.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We are selling land now in large quantities to certain English
lords, who are coming over here and buying greater estates than the
greatest in Great Britain or Ireland. We are selling them land; they
are buying land. Did it ever occur to you that they do not want that
land? They have no use whatever for American land; they do not propose
to come over here and live on it. They cannot carry it over there to
where they do live.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is not the land that they want. What they want is the income
from it. They are buying it not because they themselves want to use it,
but because by and by, as population increases, numbers of American
citizens will want to use it, and then they can say to these American
citizens: "You can use this land provided you pay us one-half of all
you make upon it." What we are selling those foreign lords is not
really land; we are selling them the labor of American citizens; we are
selling them the privilege of taking, without any return for it, the
proceeds of the toil of our children.</small><br>
<br>
<small>So, here in New York, you will read in the papers every day that
the price of land is going up. John Jones or Robert Brown has made a
hundred thousand dollars within a year in the increase in the value of
land in New York. What does that mean? It means he has the power of
getting many more coats, many more cigars, dry goods, horses and
carriages, houses or much more food and wine. He has gained the power
of taking for his own a great number of these products of human labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But what has he done? He has not done anything. He may have been
off in Europe or out west, or he may have been sitting at home taking
it easy. If he has done nothing to get this increased income, where
does it come from? The things I speak of are all products of human
labor &#8212; someone has to work for them. When a man who does no work can
get them, necessarily the people who do work to produce them must have
less of the products of human labor than they ought to have.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This is the system that the Anti-Poverty Society has banded
together to war against, and it invites you to come and swell its
ranks. It is the noblest cause in which any human being can possibly
engage. What, after all, is there in life as compared with a struggle
like this? One thing, and only one thing, is absolutely certain for
every man and woman in this hall, as it is to all else of humankind &#8212;
that is death.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What will it profit us in a few years how much we have left? Is
not the noblest and the best use we can make of life to do something to
make better and happier the condition of those who come after us &#8212; by
warring against injustice, by the enlightenment of public opinion, by
the doing of all that we possibly can do to break up the accursed
system that degrades and embitters the lot of so many?</small><br>
<br>
<small>We have a long fight and a hard fight before us. Possibly,
probably, for many of us, we may never see it come to success. But what
of that? It is a privilege to be engaged in such a struggle. This we
may know, that it is but a part of that great worldwide, long-continued
struggle in which the just and the good of every age have been engaged;
and that we, in taking part in it, are doing something in our humble
way to help bring about on earth the kingdom of God, to make the
conditions of life for those who come afterward alike to those which
prevail in heaven. ...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html"> <span
