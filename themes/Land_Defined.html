        Defined</span>        </p>
      <p>As a society, we tend to take land for granted, and treat it like dirt.
          We're encouraged in this by the way economics is taught in our colleges
        and universities.
          Real
          estate interests would just as soon have us think of <em>buildings</em> as
          being the
          <a href="../glossary.html">lion's share</a> of the the value of real
          estate, and even some academic economists preach that land value is
          largely a function of zoning rather than our dependence on land.
          But there are many other things that fit into the category of &quot;Land&quot; besides
          the sites under our feet. What
          do these things have in common? One thing is the fact that none of
          us created them, and no one can create more of them.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is true of &quot;small-l&quot; land. Other than perhaps &quot;reclaiming&quot; some wetlands
    as dry land (which we permit at our peril, as we've begun to widely recognize
    since hurricanes have been so destructive to reclaimed coastal land), we
    know we can't create even a few square feet of land, much less an entire
    building
    lot in the central business district of any town. What we've got is what
    we will have, and we all depend on it. </p>
  <p>But &quot;large-l&quot; Land is also important, and we need to be conscious of it.</p>
  <p>All sorts of things that don't make a great deal of sense when we ignore land
    as a separate factor start to become logical when we bring land into focus.
    It is our society's willingness to ignore land or treat it as if it were no
    different from that which is manmade (also known as &quot;capital&quot;)
    that has created some of our society's largest problems. When we acknowledge
    that land is different,
    and are willing to consider the huge range of ramifications of that distinction,
    we are on our way to solving them. Can you see the
    cat? Are you willing to
    have it pointed out to you? Or is our society just fine, from your point of
    view.</p>
  <p>Land includes many important things: non-renewable natural resources, the
    broadcast spectrum (as in, &quot;the airwaves belong to the American people!&quot;),
    many kinds of water rights, the right to pollute water and air. (Oh, you
    pollute
    air with your car, and therefore wonder whether  your interests
    might really lie with those who monopolize our natural resources or do large-scale
    pollution
    to make a profit? No, they don't. Particularly if you have any emotional
    investment in future generations,
    or equality,
    or
    peace.)</p>
  <p>If you are looking for solutions, look to Land, in its larger definition.
    When we reclaim Land as common property, we will find many of our biggest
    problems being solved, and life improving for the vast majority of Americans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
    distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between movables
    and immovables, between personal property and real estate. The true distinction
    is between property which is, and property which is not, the result of human
    labor; or, to use the terms of political economy, between land and wealth.
    For, in any precise use of the term, land is not wealth, any more than labor
    is wealth. Land and labor are the factors of production. Wealth is such result
    of their union as retains the capacity of ministering to human desire. A
    lot and the house which stands upon it are alike property, alike have a tangible
    value, and are alike classed as real estate. But there are between them the
    most essential differences. <strong>The one is the free gift of Nature, the
    other the result of human exertion; the one exists from generation to generation,
    while men come and go; the other is constantly tending to decay, and can
    only be preserved by continual exertion. To the one, the right of exclusive
    possession, which makes it individual property, can, like the right of property
    in slaves, be traced to nothing but municipal law; to the other, the right
    of exclusive property springs clearly from those natural relations which
    are among the primary perceptions of the human mind. </strong>Nor are these
    mere abstract distinctions. They are distinctions of the first importance
    in determining
    what should and what should not be taxed. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read

    The Meaning of the Terms</a> (Book I, Chapter 2)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-3"> </font>Land, labor, and capital are the three factors of
    production. If we remember that capital is thus a term used in contradistinction
    to land and labor, we at once see that nothing properly included under either
    one of these terms can be properly classed as capital. The term <strong>land</strong> necessarily
    includes, not merely the surface of the earth as distinguished from the water
    and the air, but the whole material universe outside of man himself, for it
    is only by having access to land, from which his very body is drawn, that man
    can come in contact with or use nature. The term land embraces, in short, all
    natural materials, forces, and opportunities, and, therefore, nothing that
    is freely supplied by nature can be properly classed as capital. A fertile
    field, a rich vein of ore, a falling stream which supplies power, may give
    to the possessor advantages equivalent to the possession of capital, but to
    class such things as capital would be to put an end to the distinction between
    land and capital, and, so far as they relate to each other, to make the two
    terms meaningless. The term <strong>labor</strong>, in like manner, includes
    all human exertion, and hence human powers whether natural or acquired can
    never properly be classed as capital. In common parlance we often speak of
    a man's knowledge, skill, or industry as constituting his capital; but this
    is evidently a metaphorical use of language that must be eschewed in reasoning
    that aims at exactness. Superiority in such qualities may augment the income
    of an individual just as capital would, and an increase in the knowledge, skill,
    or industry of a community may have the same effect in increasing its production
    as would an increase of capital; but this effect is due to the increased power
    of labor and not to capital. Increased velocity may give to the impact of a
    cannon ball the same effect as increased weight, yet, nevertheless, weight
  is one thing and velocity another.</p>
  <p><font size="-3">[26] </font>Thus we must exclude from the category of capital
    everything that may be included either as land or labor. Doing so, there
    remain only things which are neither land nor labor, but which have resulted
    from
    the union of these two original factors of production. Nothing can be properly
    capital that does not consist of these that is to say, nothing can be capital
    that is not wealth. ... <a href="HG/PP/03_b1_c2_meaning_of_the_terms.htm">read the entire chapter </a></p>

. . . Land cannot act, it can only be acted upon. . . . Nor is this principle
changed or avoided when we use the word land as expressive of the people who

  <br>
That the persons whom we call landowners may contribute their labor or their
capital to production is of course true, but that they should contribute to production

as that the belief of a lunatic in his ownership of the moon should be the cause
of her brilliancy. &#8212;<em> The Science of Political Economy </em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe315.html">unabridged:

  <p> I AM writing these pages on the shore of Long Island, where the Bay of
    New York contracts to what is called the Narrows, nearly opposite the point
    where our legalized robbers, the Custom-House officers, board incoming steamers
    to ask strangers to take their first American swear, and where, if false
    oaths really colored the atmosphere the air would be bluer than is the sky
    on this gracious day. I turn from my writing-machine to the window, and drink
    in, with a pleasure that never seems to pall, the glorious panorama. <br>
      <br>
"What do you see?"&nbsp; If in ordinary talk I were asked this, I should of course
say, "I see land and water and sky, ships and houses, and light clouds, and the
sun drawing to its setting over the low green hills of Staten Island and illuminating
all." <br>
      <br>
  But if the question refer to the terms of political economy, I should say, "I
  see land and wealth." Land, which is the natural factor of production; and
  wealth, which is the natural factor so changed by the exertion of the human
  factor, labor, as to fit it for the satisfaction of human desires. For water
  and clouds, sky and sun, and the stars that will appear when the sun is sunk,
  are, in the terminology of political economy, as much land as is the dry surface
  of the earth to which we narrow the meaning of the word in ordinary talk. And
  the window through which I look; the flowers in the garden; the planted trees
  of the orchard; the cow that is browsing beneath them; the Shore Road under
  the window; the vessels that lie at anchor near the bank, and the little pier
  that juts out from it; the trans-Atlantic liner steaming through the channel;
  the crowded pleasure-steamers passing by; the puffing tug with its line of
  mud-scows; the fort and dwellings on the opposite side of the Narrows; the
  lighthouse that will soon begin to cast its far-gleaming eye from Sandy Hook;
  the big wooden elephant of Coney Island; and the graceful sweep of the Brooklyn
  Bridge, that may be discovered from a little higher up; all alike fall into
  the economic term wealth &#8212; land modified by labor so as to afford satisfaction
  to human desires. All in this panorama that was before man came here, and would
  remain were he to go, belongs to the economic category land; while all that
  has been produced by labor belongs to the economic category wealth, so long
  as it retains its quality of ministering to human desire. <br>
      <br>
  But on the hither shore, in view from the window, is a little rectangular piece
  of dry surface, evidently reclaimed from the line of water by filling in with
  rocks and earth. What is that? In ordinary speech it is land, as distinguished
  from water, and I should intelligibly indicate its origin by speaking of it
  as "made land." But in the categories of political economy there is no place
  for such a term as "made land." For the term land refers only and exclusively
  to productive powers derived wholly from nature and not at all from industry,
  and whatever is, and in so far as it is, derived from land by the exertion
  of&nbsp;&nbsp;labor, is wealth. This bit of dry surface raised above the level
  of the water by filling in stones and soil, is, in the economic category, not
  land but wealth. It has land below it and around it, and the material of which
  it is composed has been drawn from land; but in itself it is, in the proper
  speech of political economy, wealth; just as truly as the ships I behold are
  not land but wealth, though they too have land below them and around them and
  are composed of material drawn from land. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

<p>  Bill Batt: <a
 href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
  Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics 
  </a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The starting point of the
Georgist framework is rigorous definition of
the three factors of production &#8212; land, labor, and capital, as in
classical economics. It should be further pointed out that these
factors are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all things of
economic value. Something must necessarily be in one category or
another; there is nothing <span style="font-style: italic;">outside </span>this
total classification. Understanding of what constitutes labor differs
little from definitions given elsewhere, regardless of which theory is
used. But definitions of land and capital differ somewhat from common
practice as well as sometimes in theory. Therefore, it is helpful to
spend time explicating the definitions of each as they are used in
Georgism, and to point out where these definitions diverge from those
most often employed in neoclassical economics applications. Many
contemporary economics texts begin by taking note of the
land-labor-capital distinction, but then make little use of it later.
These distinctions will make apparent why Georgist economics leads to
very different explanations of economic phenomena as well as to
different policy solutions.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Critical to an understanding of
Georgist economics is its recognition
of land as a special and unique factor of production. &#8220;Land,&#8221; to
Georgists, as true for classical economists throughout the 19th
century, is taken to mean not just the surface of the earth and
locational space; it means also any and all those natural resources and
non-human works that today can exact a market price.</span> It includes
the
wealth of the earth in all its natural forms, the air and water as well
as material elements. It includes phenomena of value like the
electromagnetic spectrum used to transmit communications signals, and
landing time slots such as have value at airports. As the world
economies enter a new age of high technology, these radio spectrums and
time allotments have gained ever increasing value. So also with
geosychronous satellite
orbits and most recently the genetic codes of all the biota on earth.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">10 ... </span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It is equally important to distinguish
those factors that are not land
in the classical sense of its economic use. Natural resources such as
coal, oil, and minerals, once removed from their natural state are no
longer regarded as land. </span>A diamond lodged in the deep earth is
land; that same diamond discovered by a prospector and then cut and
polished by a jeweler, is no longer land but capital. Likewise, fish in
the ocean are land, but fish once caught and in a boat are capital.
This is why, in any courses taught on Georgist economics, considerable
time is devoted to basic definitions. To carry the distinction just one
step further, land in the Georgist lexicon, is not wealth, whereas in
neoclassical economics it is. In the course of later discussion of the
Georgist view relative to the ecological economics approach, this will
emerge as a critical distinction, as it helps to demarcate the
boundaries of what activities fall within the realm of economic
behavior and what activities remain marginal.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This separate and identifiable
recognition of land has significant
importance for the definition of <span style="font-weight: bold;">capital
</span>too, because capital, then,
cannot be land. Capital, rather, is the product of labor and land (and
perhaps other past capital) to add to the increased store of capital of
individuals or of the community. Capital can be of many types, ranging
from monetary wealth to technical knowledge. The store of capital
applied to land and labor results in the further production of capital
wealth. Capital allows labor to be employed with greater efficiency and
productivity, through the use of technology and instruments and with
increased human skill and knowledge. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The next important step in
understanding Georgist economics is
recognition that each factor of production has its economic price: the
price of labor is wages, the price of capital is interest, and the
price of land is rent.</span> When any of these prices are unpaid,
distortions
result in the economic equilibrium and problems become manifest in
other realms of nature and society. In neoclassical economics
compensation for the use of labor and capital continue to be important
in the formulas and calculations employed to explain the economy. But
for neoclassical economics, David Ricardo&#8217;s &#8220;law of rent&#8221; is
essentially ignored and has be come for all practical purposes an
artifact in the history of economics. Rent continues to exist of
course; it is simply uncollected, left in the hands of those who
maintain monopoly control of certain services of nature, adding to
their market value in ways that distort the balance of markets. Failure
to recognize the importance of land rent (sometimes called economic
rent) is for Georgists critical to an understanding of the problems of
contemporary economies and economic analysis.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14 ... </span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>Rent
becomes critically important in Georgist economics,
because rent is the increment of market gain that accrues to choice
land parcels. This insight arose originally in the context of
agricultural societies, where differential qualities of land were
recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone to
keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the
efforts of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a
higher yield separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment
might represent, this constituted a windfall gain above and beyond what
might be minimally expected. This is land rent, and it exists even if
it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as earlier noted, the greatest land rents
derive from their location, grown out of nearby social investment.</small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The concept of rent needs
further explication precisely because it is
so foreign to 20th century students, even those who have been schooled
in economics at it is currently taught. Land rent has no relationship
to the word rent as it is used in contemporary vernacular, that is,
when one rents a car or an apartment. Rather, rent is a surplus,
defined as the return on investment above and beyond what is minimally
required to bring a service into production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To take just an elementary example,
consider that there are three parcels of land available for farming and
three farmers of equal ability and enterprise.</span> But suppose the
parcels differ in their productive capacity, due perhaps to their
fertility, access to water, and so on. If planted with similar quality
seed, the three parcels will yield different quantities of harvest, the
one with the highest quality land having the best return. The one with
the lowest quality land would in like fashion have the&nbsp;lowest
return. Economic rent is defined as the amount of surplus harvest
qualitatively measured by the difference between the parcel with the
highest return and that with the lowest return.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Even though its originator, David Ricardo, had in mind the
differential
return from agricultural lands, the concept of rent applies to other
natural services as well. Consider what happens in the case of urban
communities, using the simplest comparison with a tic-tac-toe board.
When the lattice is completely undeveloped and consists only of vacant
land squares, the locational sites have inconsequential value. But let
us suppose that each square is then settled &#8212; the first by a hotel, the
second by a department store, the third by a restaurant and so on &#8212; and
supposing that the owner of the center square is reticent to build at
all. Reserving his prerogative as titleholder he may intend ultimately
to sell. Given the rules of economics as they apply today he may be
wise to do so, keeping his money for other uses, as his square will
have increased in market value more than all the others despite his
having done nothing to improve it. It was this that prompted John
Stuart Mill to observe that &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, aris[es] from the efforts of an entire community.. . .&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> As
will be discussed later below, the single greatest factor in
determining the economic rental value of land today results not from
nutrients or access to water but rather due to site value determined by
location. And that can be priced and collected easily.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><font size="-1"><small><small>27John Stuart Mill,
Principles
of Political Economy, Book 5, ch 2, Sec.5.
</small></small></font></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Lastly, one must appreciate that
the market value of &#8220;land&#8221; of every
sort is entirely rent, as there is no human factor of labor that
accounts for its origination. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Services
of nature have no prior cost to
bring them into production existence &#8212; the electromagnetic spectrum,
for example, exists regardless of human presence on earth and so
presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy metals are
all found in nature, not the result of human creation. They are, in
19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor but of
God&#8217;s.</span> And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative on
earth &#8212;
the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as much as it was their
role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of the land. That
bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements, was an
equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of rent
collection and the exploitation of land without
recognition of its price. The practice effectively ended with what in
Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign,
driving the peasants off the land into cities to provide cheap labor
for the early English industrialists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But
the theory continued long afterwards. Georgists today argue that land
rent should be collected from titleholders so that it is not left to
render economic distortions. This in turn affects the price of labor
and the price of money. Government&#8217;s role, whatever else it does, is at
the very least responsible for defending the commons, to ascertain
titles and to collect rent. Although there are many differences about
the proper role, scope and domain of government among Georgist
adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
is central to its tenets.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Despite assiduous efforts to make clear the extent and the
limits of
the economic rent as a concept &#8212; known as well as land rent, Ricardian
rent, and ground rent, even the best of contemporary neoclassical
economists disagree. Some texts argue that certain athletes or other
star performers with great natural ability reap returns for their
efforts far above what is in fact necessary to &#8220;bring them into
productive use.&#8221; The difference between what it would minimally take to
entice them to perform and the price they are actually paid is all
economic rent. Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears, and the
Beatles have all been compensated with impressive amounts of economic
rent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">29</span></small>
Georgists and classical economists are of mixed minds, arguing
sometimes that such payments are either wages or else are simply
transfers that in no way reflect productivity.</small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><small>30 ...</small></span></small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Georgist approach to
taxation had many names: his contemporary
Thomas Shearman wrote two books calling it the &#8220;natural tax,&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">41 </span></small>and
more recently it has been referred to as the &#8220;incentive tax&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">42</span></small> and
ground rent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">43</span></small>
It should be noted once more that, by whatever name, the &#8220;land tax,&#8221;
&#8220;site value tax,&#8221; or &#8220;single tax&#8221; to George covered a far wider scope
than simply locational sites, even though today this is the base that
is given the most attention. It covered any natural factor element that
humanity chose to put into service. Today, some of these parts of
nature which have come to be &#8220;owned&#8221; by private corporations (at least
insofar as their license to such use have become entitlements) are
worth millions. The electromagnetic spectrum that has been parceled out
to the communications industry has sometimes been &#8220;auctioned&#8221; for
one-shot revenue gains, is now for all practical purposes a freehold
title
in the hands of those industries.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">44</span></small> Were
those spectrum bands retained by governments and &#8220;rented,&#8221; the revenue
would likely be far greater. Whatever increased value now results
accrues to these private owners instead of to society.</small><br>
<small><small></small></small><br>
<small>So also in the case of the auctioning of &#8220;pollution credits&#8221; or
tradeable permits, what in fact constitute the right of power
industries to treat the air as a dump to the full extent which
environmental tolerances allow.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span> These
&#8220;credits&#8221; are now &#8220;owned&#8221; by the private sector and traded back and
forth among corporations, even though all people experience the
consequences of its treatment. Airport landing slots, &#8220;prime time&#8221;
broadcasting, and many other time-sensitive dimensions have all been
handed over to the private sector with nominal benefit to the public.
London Mayor Ken Livingstone has been a strong supporter of renting the
landing slots at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports, and is at this very
time exploring a rent recovery scheme to pay for the upgrade of
components of the Jubilee tube line.</small>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><small>46
...<br>
</small></span><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big><br>
A Georgist agenda also calls for the regular auctioning of mineral
extraction rights, fishing rights, and other access to natural
resources in a way that their rent is returned fully and fairly to the
public weal. Competitively assessed royalties especially on the
extraction of mineral capital could yield billions of dollars. Alanna
Hartzok has offered compelling arguments why rent from locational sites
should be reserved to finance the services of local governments, rent
from natural resources identifiable within a nation&#8217;s boundaries should
be captured to finance national governments, and rents of those
resources beyond national borders should be used to finance world
governments....&nbsp;<small> </small><a
