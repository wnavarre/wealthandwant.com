<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Most of us are  used to thinking of &quot;rent&quot; as
        the monthly payment a tenant makes to a landlord, and most of us tend
        to think of it being largely a payment
            for
            the use of
            a building and its amenities. But as economists use the term, <strong>rent
            is the return to <em>land</em> (just as <em>wages</em> are the return to labor, and
            <em>interest</em> is the
            return to capital)</strong>, so from the point of view of the landlord,
            one's apartment rent is a combination of rent and interest. And in
            places where
            land's share
            of real estate value (<a href="LSREV.html">LSREV</a>) is high, most
            of an apartment's rent is actually what the economist calls rent,
            the return on
            land. That same apartment, located 10, 20 or 500 miles away, would
            rent for considerably less.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Land values, and therefore rent, vary widely.
        An acre of good agricultural land might be worth $2,500, while an acre
        in midtown Manhattan can easily
            be worth $250,000,000 &#8212; or 100,000 times what that agricultural
            land is worth, and rent varies similarly. (In fact, construction costs
          &#8212; and therefore building
            values &#8212; vary considerably less: a modest house can be built
            for $50 per square
            foot or less, and a deluxe one (much larger, better made and better
        equipped) might cost, at the extreme, $500 per square foot to build &#8212; and
        it takes considerable effort to spend at the high end on actual construction.
            So from low to high, on a per-square-foot basis, is a factor of <strong>1:10.</strong>    Similarly,
            a studio apartment might be 300 square feet, and a mansion 10,000 square
            feet, a factor from low to high, is a factor of <strong>1:33</strong>.
            Finally, there is depreciation. An older home might be worth only
            25% of what a similarly
            constructed, similarly sized new home is worth, due to the aging
            and obsolescence of its systems and technologies &#8212; a factor
            of 1:4 from low to high.
            Multiplying those factors together, the range on housing might be <strong>1:1,330</strong>,
            at the extreme &#8212; quite a bit narrower than the range of land
            values of <strong>1:100,000</strong>!</p>
      <p>As a quick-and-dirty rule of thumb, economic rent is about 5% of the
        market value of a property. A lot that sells for $250,000 would rent
        for $12,500 per year. (That rent is a good deal less than what one would
        pay a lender to borrow those funds.)</p>

      <blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Suppose a man comes to
      Crete, and he wants to start a business. He needs a building, but first
      he needs a piece of ground to build this new building on. So he looks
      up a real estate agent, describes what he wants, and the real estate
      agent shows him a parcel that's just right for his needs. The man asks
      the agent, "All right, now how much money do you want for this land?"
      The agent says, "It's worth $50,000." The man says, "Why is it worth
      $50,000?" And the real estate agent points out that "The school is
      good, the roads are good, the police department is good, the rescue
      crew is good and very fast, and business is good here." </small>
        <p><small>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a
      fair price. I'll take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school
      people, and the road people, and the police department? To whom do I
      pay the $50,000?" And the real estate agent says, "Oh no. You don't pay
      it to them. You pay it to the person who owned the land before."</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads,
      and the police, and the other good things?" And the real estate agent
      says, "<i>If</i> you build, then you'll pay for them again."</small></p>
        <p>The buyer then asks, &quot;And what will the previous owner do for me for
          my $50,000?&quot;&nbsp; The real estate man answers, &quot;Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing

    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>&quot;Suppose there should arise from the
        English Channel or the German Ocean a no man's land on which common labor
        to an unlimited amount should
                be able to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain
        unappropriated and of free access, like the commons which once comprised
        so large a
                part of English soil. What would be the effect upon wages in
        England?&quot;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must
              soon increase to thirty shillings a day.</p>
    </div>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect
              on rents?&quot; he would at a moment's reflection say that rents
              must necessarily fall; and if he thought out the next step he would
              tell you
              that all this would happen without any very large part of English
              labor being diverted to the new natural opportunities, or the forms
              and direction
              of industry being much changed; only that kind of production being
              abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together less
              than labor could
              secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in wages would
              be at the expense of rent.</p>

    <div style="text-align: left;">

              it will not be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent

        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <p>The value of land, as we have seen, is the price of monopoly. It
                        is not the absolute, but the relative, capability of land that determines
                        its value. No matter what may be its intrinsic qualities land that
                        is no better than other land which may be had for the using can have
                        no value. And the value of land always measures the difference between
                        it and the best land that may be had for the using. Thus, the value
                        of land expresses in exact and tangible form the right of the community
                        in land held by an individual; and rent expresses the exact amount
                        which the individual should pay to the community to satisfy the equal
                        rights of all other members of the community.</p>

                            the community, we reconcile the fixity of tenure which is necessary
                            for improvement with a full and complete recognition of the equal
                            rights of all to the use of land.</p>

        11 Effect of Remedy Upon the Sharing of Wealth</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
        IX Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: Of the Effect Upon Distribution
      and Thence Upon Production</a>
        <blockquote>
      <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all
          public burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated
          until we consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
      <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
          in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
          inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
          as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands,
          gives a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced
          by labor and capital.</p>
      <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
          and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
          this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
          the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed.
          Rent, instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality.
          Labor and capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion
          taken by the state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied
          to public purposes, would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
      <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided
          into two portions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
              producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of
          production;</li>
        <li> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
              in public benefits to all its members.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young
          children and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as
          well as the vigorous. And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents
          the result of individual effort in production, the other represents
          the increased power with which the community as a whole aids the individual.</p>
      <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by
          the community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce
          inequality as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater
          and greater equality.</p>
      <p>Who can say to what infinite powers the wealth-producing capacity of labor
          may not be raised by social adjustments which will give to the producers
          of wealth their fair proportion of its advantages and enjoyments! With
          present processes the gain would be simply incalculable, but just as wages
          are high, so do the invention and utilization of improved processes and
          machinery go on with greater rapidity and ease.</p>
      <p> But I shall not deny, and do not wish to lose sight of the fact, that
          while thus preventing waste and thus adding to the efficiency of labor,
          the equalization in the distribution of wealth that would result from
        the simple plan of taxation that I propose, must lessen the intensity
        with
          which wealth is pursued. It seems to me that in a condition of society
          in which no one need fear poverty, no one would desire great wealth &#8212; at
          least, no one would take the trouble to strive and to strain for it
          as men do now. For, certainly, the spectacle of men who have only a
          few years
          to live, slaving away their time for the sake of dying rich, is in
          itself so unnatural and absurd, that in a state of society where the
          abolition
          of the fear of want had dissipated the envious admiration with which
          the masses of men now regard the possession of great riches, whoever
          would
          toil to acquire more than he cared to use would be looked upon as we
          would now look on a man who would thatch his head with half a dozen
          hats.</p>
      <p>And though this incentive to production be withdrawn, can we not spare
          it? Whatever may have been its office in an earlier stage of development,
          it is not needed now. The dangers that menace our civilization do not come
          from the weakness of the springs of production. What it suffers from, and
          what, if a remedy be not applied, it must die from, is unequal distribution!</p>
      <p>Nor would the removal of this incentive, regarded only from the standpoint
          of production, be an unmixed loss. For, that the aggregate of production
          is greatly reduced by the greed with which riches are pursued, is one of
          the most obtrusive facts of modern society. While, were this insane desire
          to get rich at any cost lessened, mental activities now devoted to scraping
          together riches would be translated into far higher spheres of usefulness.

        of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
      Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>        Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to
          the bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of
          labor is the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we
          are not atheists, who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he
        has any concern in politics and legislation.</p>
      <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
        is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the
        life of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as
        you too perceive, it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed
        order. For He who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw
        and provided that with the increase of population and the development
        of industry the organization of human society into states or governments
        would become both expedient and necessary.</p>
      <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
        This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse,
        industry rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with
        growth of population and advance of civilization the functions of the
        state increase and larger and larger revenues are needed.</p>
      <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained
        civilization as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and
        become more and more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have
        foreseen this increasing need for state revenues and have made provision
        for it. That is to say: The increasing need for public revenues with
        social advance, being a natural, God-ordained need, there must be a right
        way of raising them &#8212; some way that we can truly say is the way
        intended by God. It is clear that this right way of raising public revenues
        must accord with the moral law.</p>
      <p>Hence:</p>
      </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</li>
      <li>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the
            prices of what some have to sell and others must buy.</li>
      <li>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by
            making it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take
        bribes.</li>
      <li>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken
            the sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are
        not sins, and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted
            right to do.</li>
      <li>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not
            punish thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production
            and the fairest division of wealth.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and
          products of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues
          are collected &#8212; the octroi duties that surround Italian cities
          with barriers; the monstrous customs duties that hamper intercourse between
          so-called Christian states; the taxes on occupations, on earnings, on
          investments, on the building of houses, on the cultivation of fields,
          on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these be the ways God has intended
          that governments should raise the means they need? Have any of them the
        characteristics indispensable in any plan we can deem a right one?</p>
        <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs
          to the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over
          the scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase
          the price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt
          government; they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine
          industry and thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and
        enrich some by impoverishing others.</p>
        <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
        of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
        <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
          are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of
          life, that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But
          out of the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and
          out of its effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell
          and others must buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which
          denies this gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy
          and proclaims laws of national well-being utterly at variance with his
          teaching. This theory sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal
          war of hostile tariffs; it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies
          in imposing on the productions of other peoples restrictions they do
          not wish imposed on their own; and instead of the Christian doctrine
        of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
        <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more
          clearly show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not
        the way God intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
        <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues
          by a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
        to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
        <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to
          tax, the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from
          any exertion of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the
          values produced in this way being values of improvement which we would
          exempt. <strong>The value of land irrespective of improvement is the value that
          attaches to land by reason of increasing population and social progress.
          This is a value that always goes to the owner as owner, and never does
          and never can go to the user; for if the user be a different person from
          the owner he must always pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money;
          while if the user be also the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that
          he receives it, and by selling or renting the land he can, as owner,
        continue to receive it after he ceases to be a user.</strong></p>
        <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
          of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
          what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
          to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to
        the community as a whole.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all
              economists are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement
              or use &#8212; or
              what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
              from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
              for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
              be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
              in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
              will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
              as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
              determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
              the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
              increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce
              such cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat
              or tobacco
              or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the
              cheapening in the cost of producing steel which improved processes
              have made in
              recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has
              no cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by
              man.
            Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly, by what the
                  owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation and consequently
                  of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor can earn on it beyond
                  what is necessary to life;<br>
              2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what
                  the particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may
                  be had by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage
                  and for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
              3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
                  in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
                  social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
                withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never be shifted
              by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase the
              demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding land
              from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
              because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
              economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
              were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
              since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
              of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
              receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
              demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
              to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
              were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
              for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
          merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
          of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
          to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
          impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on
          thrift; it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution
          of wealth, by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please,
          without any artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public
          purposes a value that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that
          of all values is most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply
          collected, it would enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense
          with oaths, do away with temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish
        man-made crimes in themselves innocent.</p>
        <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues
          it needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and
          degree of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother
        for the nourishment of the babe.</p>
        <p>See how close is the analogy. <strong>In that primitive condition
            ere the need for the state arises there are no land values. The products
            of labor
          have value, but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches
          to land itself. But as increasing density of population and increasing
          elaboration of industry necessitate the organization of the state,
            with its need for revenues, value begins to attach to land. As population
          still increases and industry grows more elaborate, so the needs for
            public
          revenues increase. And at the same time and from the same causes land
          values increase. The connection is invariable. The value of things
            produced by labor tends to decline with social development, since
            the larger scale
          of production and the improvement of processes tend steadily to reduce
          their cost. But the value of land on which population centers goes
            up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
            Consider
          the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
          of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is
            this due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations
            of
          those cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure
          for streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed
          for the health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how
          with the growth of such cities the one thing that steadily increases
          in value is land; how the opening of roads, the building of railways,
          the making of any public improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it
          not clear that here is a natural law &#8212; that is to say a tendency
          willed by the Creator? Can it mean anything else than that He who ordained
          the state with its needs has in the values which attach to land provided
        the means to meet those needs?</strong></p>
        <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper
          still, and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose
          of the intent. If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land
          values increase with the growth of society not only such a perfectly
          adapted provision for the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual
          perceptions by showing us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with
          regard to the individual that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening
        to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
        <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one
          thing that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue
          of which all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general
          improvements of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of
          justice and the dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common
          uses of society. Now, since increase in the fund available for the common
          uses of society is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member
          of society, is it not clear that the law by which land values increase
          with social advance while the value of the products of labor does not
          increase, tends with the advance of civilization to make the share that
          goes equally to each member of society more and more important as compared
          with what goes to him from his individual earnings, and thus to make
          the advance of civilization lessen relatively the differences that in
          a ruder social state must exist between the strong and the weak, the
          fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show the purpose of the Creator
          to be that the advance of man in civilization should be an advance not
          merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater equality, instead
          of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it, an advance
        toward a more and more monstrous inequality? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

      <p>WHEREVER land has an exchange value there is rent in the economic meaning
        of the term. Wherever land having a value is used, either by owner or

        value, there is rent potential. It is this capacity of yielding rent
        which gives value to land. . . . No matter what are its capabilities,
        land can yield no rent and have no value until some one is willing to
        give labor or the results of labor for the privilege of using it; and
        what anyone will thus give, depends not upon the capacity of the land,

ROBINSON CRUSOE, as we all know, took Friday as his slave. Suppose, however,
that instead of taking Friday as his slave, Robinson Crusoe had welcomed him
as a man and a brother; had read him a Declaration of Independence, an Emancipation
Proclamation and a Fifteenth Amendment, and informed him that he was a free and
independent citizen, entitled to vote and hold office; but had at the same time
also informed him that that particular island was his (Robinson Crusoe's) private
and exclusive property. What would have been the difference? Since Friday could
not fly up into the air nor swim off through the sea, since if he lived at all
he must live on the island, he would have been in one case as much a slave as
in the other. Crusoe's ownership of the island would be equivalent of his ownership
of Friday. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

THEY no longer have to drive their slaves to work; want and the fear of want
do that more effectually than the lash. They no longer have the trouble of looking
out for their employment or hiring out their labor, or the expense of keeping
them when they cannot work. That is thrown upon the slaves. The tribute that
they still wring from labor seems like voluntary payment. In fact, they take
it as their honest share of the rewards of production &#8212; since they furnish
the land! And they find so-called political economists, to say nothing of so-called
preachers of Christianity, to tell them so. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

IF the two young Englishmen I have spoken of had come over here and bought so
many American citizens, they could not have got from them so much of the produce
of labor as they now get by having bought land which American citizens are glad
to be allowed to till for half the crop. And so, even if our laws permitted,
it would be foolish for an English duke or marquis to come over here and contract
for ten thousand American babies, born or to be born, in the expectation that
when able to work he could get out of them a large return. For by purchasing
or fencing in a million acres of land that cannot run away and do not need to
be fed, clothed or educated, he can, in twenty or thirty years, have ten thousand
full-grown Americans, ready to give him half of all that their labor can produce
on his land for the privilege of supporting themselves and their families out
of the other half. This gives him more of the produce of labor than he could
exact from so many chattel slaves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

OF the two systems of slavery, I think there can be no doubt that upon the same
moral level, that which makes property of persons is more humane than that which
results from making private property of land. The cruelties which are perpetrated
under the system of chattel slavery are more striking and arouse more indignation
because they are the conscious acts of individuals. But for the suffering of
the poor under the more refined system no one in particular seems responsible.
. . . But this very fact permits cruelties that would not be tolerated under
the one system to pass almost unnoticed under the other. Human beings are overworked,
are starved, are robbed of all the light and sweetness of life, are condemned
to ignorance and brutishness, and to the infection of physical and moral disease;
are driven to crime and suicide, not by other individuals, but by iron necessities
for which it seems that no one in particular is responsible. <br>
  <br>
To match from the annals of chattel slavery the horrors that day after day transpire
unnoticed in the heart of Christian civilization, it would be necessary to go
back to ancient slavery, to the chronicles of Spanish conquest in the New World,
or to stories of the Middle passage. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

      <p><strong><em>a. Explanation of Wages and Rent</em></strong></p>
      <p>Differences in the desirableness of land divide Wealth into the two
        funds, Wages and Rent. Labor naturally applies its forces to that land
        from which, considering all the existing and known circumstances, most
        Wealth can be produced with least expenditure of labor force. Such land
        is the best. So long as the best land exceeds demand for it, laborers
        are upon an equality of opportunity, and the entire product goes to them
        as Wages in proportion to the labor force they respectively expend. But
        when the supply of the best land falls below demand for it, some laborers
        must resort to land where with an equal expenditure of labor force they
        produce less wealth than those who use the best land. The laborers thus
        excluded from the best land naturally offer a premium for it, or what
        is the same thing, offer to work for its owners for what they might obtain
        by working for themselves upon the poorer land. This condition differentiates
        Rent from Wages. Rent goes to land-owners as such, irrespective of whether
        they labor or not; Wages go to laborers as such, irrespective of whether
        they own land or not.85</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">85. Land of every kind may vary in desirableness from other land of
            the same kind. Certain farming land, for example, is so fertile that
            it will yield to a given application of labor two bushels of wheat to
            every bushel that certain other farming land will yield; and it is obvious
            that, other things being equal, farmers would prefer the more fertile
            land. But some fertile land lies so far away from market that less fertile
            land lying nearer is more productive, because it costs less to exchange
            its products for what their producer demands; in such cases farmers would
            prefer the less fertile land. The same principle applies to all kinds
            of land. Building lots at or near a center of residence or business are
            preferable for most purposes of residence or business to lots equally
            good in other respects which are far away.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Now, the land that is preferable is of course most in demand; and if
            it be all in use, with demand for it unsatisfied, competition for the
            preference sets in, and gives value to it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">All land cannot be equally desirable. Some excels in fertility. Some
            is rich with mineral deposits, a species of fertility. On some, towns
            and cities settle, thereby adding to the productiveness of the labor
            that uses it, because these sites are thus made centers of co-operation
            or trade. And yet production in the civilized state requires that the
            producer shall have exclusive possession of the land lie needs. This
            necessity inevitably gives to some people more desirable land than others
            have, even though all should have an abundance. <strong>Consequently
            the returns to equal labor are unequal. The man who has land that
            is more fertile
            or better located than that of another gets more wealth than the
            other in return for a given expenditure of labor.</strong> If, for example, one with
            given labor produces 10 bushels of corn from fertile land, equal, say,
            to $5 worth of any kind of wealth in the market, and the other with the
            same labor produces 8 bushels of corn, or $4 worth of any kind of wealth
            in the market, the first receives 2 bushels (or $1) more for his labor
            than the other receives for his, though each labors with equal effort,
            skill, and intelligence. Or, if the fertility of the land be the same,
            but its situation in reference to the market be such that the cost of
            transportation still preserves the relation of $5 to $4, the same inequality
            of wages results. It is this phenomenon that gives rise to Rent. <strong>Rent
            is the market value of just such differences in opportunity as are here
            illustrated. It is a premium for choice land, for preferential locations,
            for site, for space.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">This premium is a very different thing from compensation for labor.
            Nor is the difference modified when premium owners first obtain Wages
            for work and with them buy the premium-commanding land. Rent can no more
            be turned into compensation for labor by exchanging labor products for
            the power to exact it, than a man can be turned into Wealth by exchanging
            Wealth for him. Whether the fruits of purchase or of conquest, or of
            fraud, Rent always constitutes that part of Wealth which is deducted
            from current production as premiums for superior opportunities for production.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Wages and Rent are both drawn from Wealth, and both
            go often to the same individual and in the same form of payment,
            as when a freehold farmer
            enjoys the use of the grain he raises from more fertile land than
            his neighbors have, or a city freeholder occupies or receives hire
            from his
            house and lot: but Wages flow from Wealth to labor as compensation
            for production, while Rent flows from Wealth to land-owners in premiums
            for
            allowing labor to produce Wealth from superior locations. Wages are
            appurtenant to Labor; Rent is appurtenant to Land. It is as laborer
            that the individual
            takes Wages, but as land-owner that he takes Rent.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>        This illustrates the elementary principle of Distribution, that Wages
        fall and Rent rises as demand for land forces labor to land of lower
        productiveness.90 The principle may be more graphically illustrated by
        supposing that demand for spaces in the chart advances so far as to include
        all the closed spaces, except part of the poorest one. Thus: [chart]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">90. Though figures are used, these charts are to be understood not as
            mathematical demonstrations, but simply as illustrations.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We now find that all Wages have fallen to the level of Wages on the
        poorest land that yields anything to the given unit of labor force; while
        the Rent of all but that has, at the expense of Wages, risen in proportion
        to its superior productiveness.91</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">91. The labor that was forced to the poorest lands would continually
            bid for the opportunities that the better lands offered, until an equilibrium
            was reached at the point shown in the preceding chart, where the given
            expenditure of labor is as well compensated in one place as in another.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">If laborer and land-owner be different persons, the laborer receives
            what is distinguished as Wages, and the land-owner what is distinguished
            as Rent. If the same person, he receives Wages as laborer and Rent as
            land-owner.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Reflection will convince us that this must be so. Wages for a given
        expenditure of labor force are no more anywhere, for any length of time,
        all things considered, than the same expenditure of labor force will
        produce from the best land to be had for nothing. Rent absorbs the difference.92</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">92. But we must not jump to the conclusion that there is any essential
            wrong in Rent. Rent is nature's method of measuring the value of the
            differences in natural opportunity which different laborers, owing to
            variations in land, are obliged to accept. And, what in practice is more
            important, it is nature's method of measuring the value to each individual
            of those advantages which consist in accumulations of common knowledge,
            in co-operative effort, in good government, in a word, in the benefits
            that society as a whole confers as distinguished from those which each
            individual earns. The question is not one of the rightfulness or the
            wrongfulness of Rent. Personal freedom necessitates Rent, for it necessitates
            the private possession of land, and private possession of land makes
            Rent inevitable. Nothing short of communism could abolish it. The real
            question is, What shall society do with Rent? Shall it give it to individuals,
            or use it for common purposes?</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Were there only one man on earth, he would have
            a right to the use of the whole earth.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;When there is more than one man on earth, the right to the use
            of land that any one of them would have, were he alone, is not abrogated;
            it is only limited. . . It has become by reason of this limitation, not
            an absolute right to use any part of the earth, but (1) an absolute right
            to use any part of the earth as to which his use does not conflict with
            the equal rights of others (i. e., which no one else wants to use at
            the same time), and (2) a co-equal right to the use of any part of the
            earth which he and others may want to use at the same time.&quot; &#8212; Perplexed
            Philosopher, p. 45.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">It is in adjustment of this co-equal right that rent
            occurs.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></font></p>

      <p>b. Normal Effect of Social Progress upon Wages and Rent</p>
      <p>In the foregoing charts the effect of social growth is ignored, it being
        assumed that the given expenditure of labor force does not become more
        productive.93 Let us now try to illustrate that effect, upon the supposition
        that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
        of labor force as applied to the first closed space, to 100; as applied
        to the second, to 50; as applied to the third, to 10; as applied to the
        fourth, to 3, and as applied to the open space, to 1. 94 If there were
        no increased demand for land the chart would then be like this: [chart]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">93. &quot;The effect of increasing population upon
            the distribution of wealth is to increase rent .. . in two ways:
            First, By lowering
          the margin of cultivation. Second, By bringing out in land special
          capabilities
            otherwise latent, and by attaching special capabilities to particular
            lands.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am disposed to think that the latter mode, to which little attention
            has been given by political economists, is really the more important.&quot; &#8212; Progress
            and Poverty, book iv, ch. iii.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;When we have inquired what it is that marks off land from those
            material things which we regard as products of the land, we shall find
            that the fundamental attribute of land is its extension. The right to
            use a piece of land gives command over a certain space &#8212; a
            certain part of the earth's surface. The area of the earth is fixed;
            the geometric
            relations in which any particular part of it stands to other parts
            are fixed. Man has no control over them; they are wholly unaffected
            by demand;
            they have no cost of production; there is no supply price at which
            they can be produced.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;The use of a certain area of the earth's surface is a primary
            condition of anything that man can do; it gives him room for his own
            actions, with the enjoyment of the heat and the light, the air and the
            rain which nature assigns to that area; and it determines his distance
            from, and in great measure his relations to, other things and other persons.
            We shall find that it is this property of land, which, though as yet
            insufficient prominence has been given to it, is the ultimate cause of
            the distinction which all writers are compelled to make between land
            and other things.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's Prin., book iv, ch. ii,
            sec. i.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">94. Of course social growth does not go on in this regular way; the
            charts are merely illustrative. They are intended to illustrate the universal
            fact that as any land becomes a center of trade or other social relationship
          its value rises.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Though Rent is now increased, so are Wages. Both benefit by social growth.
        But if we consider the fact that increase in the productive power of
        labor increases demand for land we shall see that the tendency of Wages
        (as a proportion of product if not as an absolute quantity) is downward,
        while that of Rent is upward. 95 And this conclusion is confirmed by
        observation. 96</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">95. &quot;Perhaps it may be well to remind the reader, before closing
            this chapter, of what has been before stated &#8212; that I am using
            the word wages not in the sense of a quantity, but in the sense of a
            proportion. When I say that wages fall as rent rises, I do not mean that
            the quantity of wealth obtained by laborers as wages is necessarily less,
            but that the proportion which it bears to the whole produce is necessarily
            less. The proportion may diminish while the quantity remains the same
            or increases.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iii, ch. vi.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">96. The condition illustrated in the last chart would be the result
            of social growth if all land but that which was in full use were common
            land. The discovery of mines, the development of cities and towns, and
            the construction of railroads, the irrigation of and places, improvements
            in government, all the infinite conveniences and laborsaving devices
            that civilization generates, would tend to abolish poverty by increasing
            the compensation of labor, and making it impossible for any man to be
            in involuntary idleness, or underpaid, so long as mankind was in want.
            If demand for land increased, Wages would tend to fall as the demand
            brought lower grades of land into use; but they would at the same time
            tend to rise as social growth added new capabilities to the lower grades.
            And it is altogether probable that, while progress would lower Wages
            as a proportion of total product, it would increase them as an absolute
            quantity. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
      <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social
        progress, while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if
        Rent be treated as common property, advances in productive power shall
        be steps in the direction of realizing through orderly and natural growth
        those grand conceptions of both the socialist and the individualist,
        which in the present condition of society are justly ranked as Utopian?
        Is it not likewise a plain warning that if Rent be treated as private
        property, advances in productive power will be steps in the direction
        of making slaves of the many laborers, and masters of a few land-owners?
        Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent is in harmony with natural
        law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly and degrading?
        When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the preceding
        chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth that God
        made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how can a
        contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97 the
        benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
        to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses.
        98</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary
            settler. Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public
            revenues, and none of the land about him has any value. Another settler
            comes, and another, until a village appears. Some public revenue
            is then required. Not much, but some. And the land has a little value,
            only a little; perhaps just enough to equal the need for public revenue.
            The village becomes a town. More revenues are needed, and land values
            are higher. It becomes a city. The public revenues required are enormous,
            and so are the land values.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising
            with the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline
            of society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as
            distinguished from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand,
            measure the earning power of the individuals as distinguished from
            that of society as a whole. We have distinguished the parts into
            which Wealth is distributed as Wages and Rent; but it would be correct,
            indeed it is the same thing, to regard all wealth as earnings, and
            to distinguish the two kinds as Communal Earnings and Individual
            Earnings. How, then, can there be any question as to the fund from
            which society should be supported? How can it be justly supported
            in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and
        who can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings
        of the community, shall be retained for the support of the community,
        and that Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the
        individual in proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine
        law, whether we trace it through complex moral and economic relations,
        or find it in the eighth commandment. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

an equal right; a joint or common right is to rent.&quot;* It means rather the

    <blockquote>
      <p>&#8220;Land,&#8221; in the language of economics, includes all natural
          resources: the three-dimensional space on the surface of the Earth
        (including space in and on water); material land such as minerals, water,
        and oil;
          the electromagnetic spectrum; wildlife (including wild animals and
        forests); and satellite orbits.</p>
      <p>The most important potential source of public revenue from land is real
          estate sites. The income from land has been called &#8220;ground rent,&#8221; &#8220;economic
          rent,&#8221; or just &#8220;rent.&#8221; The term &#8220;rent&#8221; here
          will refer to the income only from the land, excluding what is paid for
          the use of the improvements. The &#8220;economic rent&#8221; with respect
          to land refers to the maximum that a tenant would bid for the use of the
          site. I have called this &#8220;geo-rent&#8221; to differentiate it from &#8220;rent&#8221; as
          a payment for any resource or from the actual amount a tenant may pay,
          which could be less than what the market could bear.</p>
      <p>Land value taxation taps the geo-rent. Like today&#8217;s real property
          tax, a land value tax would have some tax rate that would tap some
        percentage of the land value or rent. I suggest 80 percent of the geo-rent
        be used
          for public revenue. The landowner would pay it from the rental he collects
          from the tenant, or if owner-occupied, from the implicit rental value
        he obtains from the site. The 80 percent rate would leave some of the
        land
          rent with the landowner to have a margin for assessment error and also
          to maintain a positive price for the land to facilitate its sale. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

    <blockquote>
      <p>Every community, whatever its political name and extent -- village, city,
          state or province or nation -- has its own normal, unfailing income, growing
          with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary
          governmental expenditure.</p>
      <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the
          land on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties
          and advantages of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this
          land in its natural state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted
          and unoccupied, including its waters, its contents and its location, every
          individual in the community (which may consist of any political unit selected)
          has an equal right, while all the individuals together have a joint right
          to the value for use which society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
      <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
          descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
      <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground
          is the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use
          of that ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements
          thereon. Every holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays
          most of it to the wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory
          occupied by any political unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient,
          usually more than sufficient, for the legitimate expenses of the government
          of that unit. As also stated above, the economic rent belongs to the community,
          and not to individual landowners. <strong><font size="+1">...</font></strong></p>
      <p>  Let us roughly restate the proposition: All members of the community having
          a joint right to the income which the social advantages of the land will
          command, they are all partners in this income.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when one of their number wishes to take for his private use
          a parcel of this land, he should buy out his partners, i.e., the rest of
          the community, by paying regularly into the common treasury the economic
          rent of that parcel, instead of paying, as at present, the purchase price,
          i.e., the right to collect the economic rent, in a lump, to some other
          individual who has no more original right to it than himself. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

              pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
              period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
              location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
              travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
              businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each

              four principles of taxation which any source of revenue should

            <p align="left"><small>4. Equitable and fair, payment for benefits received,

        <div align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Collecting public revenue from
              land rent is the only revenue
          source, or "tax", that meets these criteria.</small></div>
        <div align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While the major argument for
              raising public revenue from land rent
              and natural resources is because it is equitable and fair, it is also
              the most efficient method of raising the revenue which is needed for
              public facilities and services. Land is visible, can't be hidden and
              its valuation is less intrusive than valuations of income and sales.
              Taxes on labor and capital cause people to consider alternative
              options, including working with less effort, which produces less real
              goods. For example, a tax on wages will reduce after-tax net wages
              and weaken the incentive to work. A person might be willing to work
              hard for a wage of $20 per hour, but decide to drop out if the taxes
              take $8 and the net wage is only $12 per hour. Economists claim that
              present taxes account for a 25% loss in production in the United
              States. Production and consumption would be greatly improved if
              public revenue came primarily from land rather than a wage tax. The
              same would occur when buildings and machinery are taxed. The tax on
              building reduces the quantity and quality of buildings produced. A
              tax on sales, commerce or value added reduces consumption, production
              and net wealth. Sales tax evasion in the United States has exceeded
          30% in recent years.</small></p>
        <p align="left" style="text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>As new
              inventions and more
              efficient ways of producing goods are
              discovered, people's economic well-being is not improved, because
              they have lost access to land and must pay both rent and taxes. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)</span>
              Instead of rent being used to provide community services, capital and
          wages must be depleted, which obstructs private enterprise.</small></small></p>
        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
              taken for public purposes production and

              rent would otherwise have been taken by some private individual. The
              rent would be the same, the difference is how it is utilized. </span>There
              is evidence that communities who raise their revenue from land,
              rather than from labor and capital, are more prosperous, many

              put land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land
              values to the man who is putting it to an inferior use, and in some

              for the time being is able to levy his toll upon all other forms of

              every benefit which is laboriously acquired by the community is
              represented in the land value, and finds its way automatically into the
              landlord's pocket. If there is a rise in wages, rents are able
              to move forward, because the workers can afford to pay a little more.
              If the opening of a new railway or a new tramway or the institution of
              an improved service of workmen's trains or a lowering of fares or a new
              invention or any other public convenience affords a benefit to the
              workers in any particular district, it becomes easier for them to live,
              and therefore the landlord and the ground landlord, one on top of the
              other, are able to charge them more for the privilege of living there.

              me in a few words point out the way of
              getting rid of land monopoly, securing the right of all to the elements
              which are necessary for life. We could not divide the land. In a rude
              state of society, as among the ancient Hebrews, giving each family its
              lot and making it inalienable we might secure something like equality.
              But in a complex civilisation that will not suffice. It is not,
              however, necessary to divide up the land. All that is necessary is to
              divide up the income that comes from the land. In that way we can
              secure absolute equality; nor could the adoption of this principle
              involve any rude shock or violent change. It can be brought about
              gradually and easily by abolishing taxes that now rest upon capital,
              labour and improvements, and raising all our public revenues by the
              taxation of land values; and the longer you think of it the clearer you
              will see that in every possible way will it be a benefit.</small><br>

    for Taxing Land</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
      and Efficiency</small><br>
      <small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
      <small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
      <small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
      <small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
      <small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
      <small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
      a case
      for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
      logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
      follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
      principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
      the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
      one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
      is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
      important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
      efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
      because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
      for taxing land has two main parts.<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
      </strong><br>
      <small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
      on land
      would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
      report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
      shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
      in the Appendix.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
      taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
      reasons
      why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
      world peace.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
      argument for
      taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
      offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
      rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
      price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
      land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
      increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
      become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
      land.&nbsp; The answer to this argument is that collecting a large
      percentage of the rental value of land through taxes will require new
      assessment methods based on observing the rental price of land rather
      than the selling price.&nbsp; I describe how such methods can be
      devised.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
      on
      land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
      the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
      </strong><br>
      <small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
      erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
      because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
      collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
      <small>.</small><br>
      <small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
      that the
      return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
      rent.&nbsp; This argument represents a refusal to make a distinction
      that begs to be made.&nbsp; The first principle of economic justice is
      that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; While some scholars have
      asserted that people have rights to them&shy;selves but not to their
      talents, this is nonsensical.&nbsp; Without talents, there is no
      self.&nbsp; Talents are fundamentally different from land.&nbsp; The
      equal rights of all to land can consistently be asserted while still
      asserting that every person has right to the use of his or her talents.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
      what land
      is. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The fact that structures are durable and immobile also means
      that care
      must be taken in defining the value of the flow of land services.&nbsp;
      There is a tendency to think of &#8220;the rent of land&#8221; as the amount of
      money that land yields to those who have exclusive use of it.&nbsp;
      How&shy;ever, this formulation is not always useful for defining the
      rent of land over a particular interval of time.&nbsp; If an investor
      spends a year and &pound;20 million erecting a building that is
      expected to last for 30 years, what was the rent of the land under the
      building during the year of construction?&nbsp; It is not sensible to
      say that, if the best possible use of the land produces a negative cash
      flow over a given interval of time, then land has no rental value over
      that interval.&nbsp; If markets were perfect and the decision to
      construct the structure was optimal, the finished building would have a
      value that was greater than its cost of construction by the rent of the
      land it occupied and the accumulated interest on construction costs and
      land rent.&nbsp; But if a non-optimal construction decision is made,
      that does not reduce the rent of land.&nbsp; </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>To give a meaning to &#8216;the rent of land&#8217; that does not
      depend on when
      construction happens to occur, it is useful to define &#8216;the rent of
      land&#8217; as the opportunity cost of leaving vacant land vacant.&nbsp; Thus
      in the case of the year of construction discussed above, one would ask,
&#8216;Suppose that the construction had been postponed for a year.&nbsp;
      Perhaps by that time it would be appropriate to invest in a &pound;21
      million building rather than a &pound;20 million building.&nbsp; If one
      developed the most profitable possible plan for the land, subject to
      the constraint that the land be left vacant for the first year, how
      much lower would the present value of net returns be?&#8217;&nbsp; The answer
      to this question, the loss of the present value of net returns from
      postponing use of land for a year, would be the rent of the land for
      the year.&nbsp; This is the amount of money that one would need to get
      in net returns from some pre-existing use to justify postponing
      redevelopment for a year.&nbsp; Thus the rent of land for any developed
      site, for any year, is defined to be the answer to the question, &#8216;If
      this site were undevel&shy;oped, what would be the cost of leaving
      undeveloped and unused for a year?&#8217;</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Land also differs from labor and capital in the origin of claims
      to own
    it.&nbsp; </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>Labor can be defined as the factors of production that own
    themselves.&nbsp;    </small></li>
      <li><small>Ownership of capital is derived originally from
    organizing its production and paying the various factors that are
    employed to produce it.&nbsp;    </small></li>
      <li><small>Ownership of land, by contrast, derives
    from rights of exclusive use and access that are granted by governments.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><small>Ownership of land is thus a form
        of privilege.&nbsp; The word
&#8216;privilege&#8217; comes from the Latin prive + legis, meaning &#8216;private
        law&#8217;.&nbsp; A private law is a law that has someone&#8217;s name it, that is,
        a law that authorizes one person to do what others are not permitted to
        do.&nbsp; In a just world, there would be no privilege.&nbsp; (Thus no
        one is underprivileged.)&nbsp; In a just world, land would not be
&#8216;owned&#8217;, but rather &#8216;held&#8217; or &#8216;possessed&#8217;,
subject to a payment that reflected the value given up by others in allowing
one person to have
        exclusive use of a site. ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

        <small><b>there is a way of raising
      revenue for local public

    </div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The rent of land is the amount
      of money that would be bid for
      the use of land in an auction.</b> It can be thought of as 100 rubles
      more than the second-highest bid, that is, the amount of money that
      the person for whom the use of land is most valuable must bid to
    outbid the person who places the second-highest value on it.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What land is worth to a person who
      wants to use it depends on the
      length of time for which he will be allowed to use it. For the
      purpose of defining rent, this length of time should be indefinitely
      long, but with provision for revising the rent as market conditions
      change. In other words, if similar land rents for 20% more three
      years from now, then the person who secures the use of a site this
    year would be required to pay that additional 20% at that time.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The rent of land also depends on
      the condition of the land. The
      rent of land is what people would bid for unimproved land. In a town,
      unimproved land is land without any structures on it. In an
      agricultural area, many things other than structures can count as
      improvements--drainage, stone removal, fertilization, leveling, etc.
      It might be hard to find agricultural land that had no such
      improvements. Thus in agricultural areas, one must subtract something
      from observed payments for the use of land, to account for the value
    that is being paid for such improvements.</small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The comments above describe how
      one might observe the rental value
      of land. Economics can also say something about how a bidder would
      decide how much to bid. A bidder would decide how he could use the
      land most profitably, compute the net revenue from the most
      profitable use after all costs including the cost of his own
      entrepreneurial effort and a premium for the risk to his finances,
      and what was left would be the total rent of the land for the period
      of the investment. The bidder would then estimate future rent,
      subtract that from the total rent, and what was left would be rent
      for the current period.<a href="../docs/Tideman_Farm_Rural.html"> Read

    in a Tax-free Society</a>&nbsp; (Outline of remarks by Mason Gaffney,
    for use at Moscow Congress,
    5/21/96)&nbsp;
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Rents are a taxable surplus.
      I estimate that this taxable surplus constitutes 35% or more of the
      national income in most nations with market economies, and more in
      resource-rich nations. ...</small><br>
      <small>&nbsp;2. The value of rent is huge. Every economy produces a
      large
      excess over wages. To be sure, not all of it is surplus. Some of it
      goes to replace capital that wears out each year. This is not part of
      the net surplus, nor income to the capitalist; it is a return of
      capital. ... </small><br>
      <small>&nbsp;3. Rent will become huger yet when you abate taxes
      presently
      levied on production and exchange, because these now depress the rent
      of land. That is, in a tax-free market economy, the benefit of abating
      present taxes will lodge mainly in land rents. The taxable surplus
      simply shifts from one form to another. </small><br>
      <small>This is more than a simple shift of a fixed amount. When you
      substitute land revenues for existing taxes, the surplus actually
      grows, as if by synergy. You gain more revenue base than you lose,
      because existing taxes now suppress much latent production. Payroll
      taxes directly drive workers from taxable jobs to untaxed gains from
      crime. Abating those taxes will unleash suppressed economic giants,
      along with all the new surplus values their latent production will
      generate. "Monetarists" warn you that "there are no free lunches." In
      fact, however, good policy creates lots of "free lunches." It makes
      the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Imagine the benefits,
      alone, of turning people from destructive careers in crime to useful
      jobs producing goods.</small><br>
      <small>4. Some of the benefit of abating
      existing taxes will
      lodge in higher after-tax wage rates, rather than higher rents. ... </small><br>
      <small>&nbsp;5. Many varieties of natural resources generate rents.
      City
      land is the greatest single source. For example, one city, Vancouver,
      contains half the value of taxable property in B.C. - a province of
    934,000 sq. kilometers, or 70% larger than France. ...</small> <small><a

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We've just seen how returns from
      land are, by nature, monopolistic and,
      by rights, should be returned to the community. But how do we calculate
      this amount?</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHO GETS THE COCONUTS?</span></small><br>
      <small>It's perhaps best illustrated by the Robinson Crusoe scenario,
      where he
      finds himself alone on a desert island. Rob naturally settles on the
      best available land which, for argument's sake, can produce 20 coconuts
      per acre per month. Along comes Man Friday, who gets the second-best
      land producing 18 coconuts per acre. This best, freely-available land
      of Friday is called the marginal land and, as we'll see, determines
      both the level of wages and that of rent.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>For how much could Rob rent out his land - 2 coconuts or 20
      coconuts
      per acre? Friday would only be prepared to pay 2, because he can
      already get 18 from his. So here's our first definition, that of the
      Law of Rent: The application of labour and capital equipment being
      equal, the rent of land is determined by the difference between the
      value of its produce and that of the least productive land in use. So
      if Man Saturday comes along (the next day?!) and finds that the best
      available land can only produce 15 coconuts per acre, Rob could rent
      his land out to Saturday for 5 coconuts per acre, and Friday for 2.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What then determines the level
      of wages?</span>
      When Friday came along and could work land yielding 18 coconuts per
      acre in a month, then he wouldn't accept wages offered by Rob for less
      than 18 coconuts. But when Saturday arrived, suddenly Friday could only
      command 15 per month, because Rob knows that the going rate (that
      applicable to Saturday at the margin) is only 15. So here we have the
      Law of Wages, which is the corollary of the law of rent: Wages are the
      reward that labour can obtain on marginal land, i.e. the most
      productive land available to it without paying rent.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Of course it all gets more complicated by technology, trade
      unions,
      immigration, the existence of a pool of unemployed, personal
      preferences, levels of education etc., but these strong underlying laws
      always hold. But let's now tie up the factors of production. Rent is
      the return to land, wages are the return to labour, and interest is the
      return to capital. The law of interest can be stated thus: Interest is
      the return that the use of capital equipment can obtain on marginal
      land, i.e. the most productive land available to it without paying rent.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">PROGRESS AND POVERTY, SIDE BY
      SIDE</span></small><br>
      <small>So here's the alarming paradox of progress marching side by side
      with
      poverty. Those who have grabbed the best land get richer and richer
      (from increasing rent) while the tenants and wage-earners get poorer
      and poorer for having to accept lower and lower wages as the margin is
      pushed out to less productive land). Henry George, in his classic <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>
      drove home this point, but took about 600 pages to deal with all the
      complications and fine details not examined here. It's no wonder that
      the unmasking of this great paradox - the title of his book - hit the
      19th century world like a great revelation. And it's no wonder that
      vested interests, through the neoclassical economics that they
      fostered, knew they had to shut him up. And, by successfully silencing
      him, it's no wonder that, despite all efforts, increasing and ever more
      alarming disparities of wealth are the norm world-wide.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>But, anyway, how many coconut-basketsful of LVT should we
      collect?
      Chuck away all those calculators, guys, for the answer is simple: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Collect the rent, the whole rent, and
      nothing but the rent.</span>
      Assuming that everyone has to do the same amount of work to produce
      their differing yields of coconuts, when Friday came along then we'd
      collect 2 coconuts per acre from Rob. This would leave 18 coconuts in
      each of their hands, and 2 coconuts of rent or LVT collected. When
      Saturday arrived we'd collect 5 from Rob and 3 from Friday, which would
      leave 15 coconuts in everyone's hands and 8 coconuts of rent collected.
      Result: everybody effectively shares equally in the bounty of Our One
      Earth, and we have a natural, non-punitive form of revenue raising with
      which to fund infrastructure.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>We've already seen how speculators can presently hold on to idle
      parcels of land, waiting for unearned increases in their value to
      accrue to them. But here's another curse of land speculation: by
      locking up productive land, it forces newcomers out to less productive
      land. By "pushing back the margin", the evil of speculation
      simultaneously raises rents and lowers wages. LVT makes it impossible
      for speculators to enjoy unearned income.&nbsp; </small><small><span

    the Whole Rent, and Nothing but the Rent</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rent is the highest bid that a
      normal tenant would pay for the use of
      land. Economists have divided the resources that go into production
      into land, labor, and capital goods. The wealth that is produced is
      distributed to the owners of these three "factors of production." That
      portion that goes to landowners is rent. ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../auth/Tideman.html">Professor
      Nicolaus Tideman</a> defines
      rent more precisely as the "second highest bid for the use of land when
      it is unimproved, when the user has an option on continued use into the
      indefinite future." </span>In an ideal auction, we want the good to go
      to the highest bidder but at the price set by the second-highest bid,
      to avoid penalizing too-high bidding. In practice, if the folks who
      want to rent land have no special emotional attachment to a site, then
      the highest bids will be similar.</small><br>
      <br>
    <small>Land includes all natural resources, including </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>the spatial surface of the earth, 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>material resources such as water and minerals, 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>the radio spectrum, 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>the atmosphere used for travel or as a dump, 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>all wildlife, and 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>the genetic information in living beings.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
      tenant's payment for a site has two
    components. </span></small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>The pure land rent is the natural rent, the payment for
    the
    resource as provided by nature. 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>The second component is a rental for the advantages of a
    site due
    to the civic works. This is the infrastructure such as streets, parks,
    utilities, security, schools, and the legal system which makes real
    estate much more useful. This rental is really a return to capital
    goods and labor services rather than land.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Real-estate land rent and
      rentals arise from the differing productivity
      of various sites: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">rent is the
      differential between the productivity of
      a site relative to the least productive marginal sites</span>. ...</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If we regard human beings as
      having
      equal moral worth, then it is morally wrong for some to be masters and
      others slaves.</span> Each person therefore has proper moral ownership
      of his labor and wage. Such self-ownership does not extend to land, but
      people may properly have individual rights to possess land, since this
      is necessary for the application of labor, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it is efficient for land
      to be under private title and control.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But it is not necessary for
      efficiency for the pure land rent to belong
      to the individual title holder. </span>Economists use the term
"economic rent"
      for payments beyond what is needed to put a factor of production to
      efficient use. Land rent is economic rent, since the land is already
      there, and for real estate, the amount of land within some boundary
      line is fixed. So when rent is used for the public finances, it does
      not reduce the quantity of land. The rent will not be passed on to the
      tenant, since the payment of the rent to a community does not change
      the supply or demand for land.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The use of rent for public revenues therefore has no excess
      burden, no
      burden on society or the economy. Taxes on income, goods, and
      transactions do have an excess burden, since by raising the price and
      reducing the quantity of goods, resources do not get allocated to where
      the people most want them. Taxes on labor and goods raise prices, while
      rent-based payments do not affect the rent, and they lower the price of
      land rather than raise it.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent is therefore the ideal
      source of
      general public and community revenue. </span>Tax reform should
      therefore shift to rent as the primary source of general funds.
      Pollution charges can supplement the rent, and indeed can be considered
      a rental charge for using and abusing the atmosphere, land, soil, and
      other forms of land. There could also be user fees for services
      specific to users, fines for violating traffic rules, and profits from
      enterprises.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The economic rent from
      minerals,
      water, and oil would be natural resource royalties that could be paid
      by bidding for the rights to extract, from payments based on the amount
      of mining, and the profits from the operations, depending on the
      circumstances.&nbsp; ... <br>
      <br>
      </span> The public and community collection of rent puts
      land at its most productive use, maximizing the wages of workers while
      minimizing sprawl as well as boom/bust cycles. We need to understand
      rent to fully understand the market process and the cause and remedy of
      many of today's social problems</small>.<small><span

 href="../docs/Foldvary_Geo-Rent.html">Geo-Rent: A Plea to Public
    Economists</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The term &#8220;rent&#8221; is most
    generally defined as a payment for the use of
    any resource (Alchian, 1991). &#8220;Land rent&#8221; could refer either to the
    actual amount paid by tenants or to the potential or economic rent. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">My
    analysis here is based on an assessment or estimate of what the
    plot-devoid-of-improvements would rent for in a market or auction.</span>
    This has been called "ground rent" or &#8220;economic land rent,&#8221; but those
    names and others are easily misunderstood. To ensure against the hazard
    of reasonable but erroneous inference, I propose an exotic label, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">geo-rent</span>.
&#8220;Geo&#8221; in Latin means earth or ground, and it also suggests George, as
    in Henry George.</span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>A site&#8217;s geo-rent is not based on the particular activity at
    that site.
    The geo-rent of a site containing lavish buildings and gardens equals
    what the geo-rent would be if, for some strange reason, those
    improvements suddenly disintegrated. A fully developed site has about
    the same geo-rent (per acre) as an adjacent vacant lot.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Suppose I own a 50-acre site that is pristine, unimproved. That
    site
    would rent for $100,000. Hence, the geo-rent is $100,000. The next year
    I build a large beautiful and successful shopping center on the site.
    My geo-rent is still only $100,000 (assuming the amount for which my
    site unimproved would rent has not changed). However, if my shopping
    center makes neighboring land more valuable, it <span
 style="font-style: italic;">does </span>increase my neighbor&#8217;s
    geo-rent.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The interrelation between one landowner&#8217;s improvements and his
    neighbor&#8217;s geo-rent is an interesting matter. Another interesting
    matter is a landowner&#8217;s contribution to improvements on neighboring
    lands, such as sponsoring a new road. If the new road would increase
    his geo-rent tax bill, geo-rent taxation, it would seem, would reduce
    his incentive to sponsor such an improvement.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small>
    But here I leave these tangents aside, with the summary judgment that I
    do not think that such issues do much, if anything, to weaken the case
    for tapping geo-rent.</small><br>
    <small><small></small></small><small><small>1 The effect on geo-rent
    would
    be smaller if the road is a toll-road, because then more of the value
    added is internalized, i.e., capture by the road owners.</small> ... <a

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Land rents are subject to
common forces that
differed from and are generally reverse to those that determine
interest rates (the price of capital).</b></small><br>
<small><b></b></small><br>
<small><b></b>Interest rates around the world rise and fall in
sympathy.&nbsp;
They
are subject to common, interconnecting forces of supply and demand,
transmitted swiftly even in past centuries, and today
instantaneously.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Land rents, too, rise and fall together in response to common
forces.&nbsp; However, the forces are different for land rents than for
interest rates, so they do not vary in sympathy.&nbsp; Even though the
lands are not mutually convertible, they are subject to common forces,
the greatest of which is the interest rate itself.&nbsp; Capital and
land
are rivals for the same pie, so usually their returns vary
inversely.&nbsp; Ground rent equals operating cash flow <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">less interest on
the cost of building</span>, and less building depreciation.&nbsp; A
rise of
interest rates lowers ground rents.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is hard to see how any forecast of the results of economic
policy,
or any forecast for investment purposes, could have any value without
keeping focused on this distinction.&nbsp; Sometimes it is handled by
distinguishing old" from "new" assets or issues.&nbsp;
Yet, in general, neoclassical doctrine tells us to meld land and
capital
in economic thinking of all kinds.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>High land price guides investors to prefer kinds of capital that
substitute for land.&nbsp; Although capital cannot be converted into
land, it can substitute for land, and does so when rents and land
prices
are high.&nbsp; John Stuart Mill long ago pointed out that the
structure
and character of capital is determined by the level of rents and
wages.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19&nbsp;</span></small>
Such substitution is an integral part of the
equilibrating function of markets; the human race could never have
attained its present numbers and density without it.&nbsp; High wages
evoke labor-saving capital; high rents evoke land-saving capital.&nbsp;
It is useful to carry this farther, and recognize five kinds of
substitutive capital evoked by high rents and land prices:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>a.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-saving
capital, like high buildings.<br>
b.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-enhancing
capital, meaning capital used to improve land for new, higher
use.<br>
c.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-linking
capital, like canals and rails and city streets.<br>
d.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-capturing
(rent-seeking) capital, like squatters' improvements, and canal
and rail lines built to secure land grants,
and dams and canals built to secure water rights. <br>
e. Rent-leading capital.<strong> ...
</strong></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Land rent is nearly identical with taxable surplus.&nbsp; This
follows from simply observing that the supplies of labor and
capital are highly elastic, while the supply of land (within any given
taxing jurisdiction ) is totally inelastic, because&nbsp; a
"jurisdiction" is defined as a specific area of land. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and the &#8220;Physiocrats,&#8221; and their
fellow-traveler A.R. Jacques Turgot, deduced from the above that almost
all taxes, whatever the nominal base, are shifted to land rents, and
lodge there.&nbsp; Market forces tend to equalize all AFTER-tax returns
to labor and capital, because of their mobility or, in the case of some
labor, the inability of humans to survive on less than subsistence
wages.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>As a corollary, if there is no rent there is nothing to
tax.&nbsp; E.R.
A. Seligman in one of his exhortations against the single tax, warned
that a
marginal community --one on land of no value -- can have no tax base if
it taxes only land. However, this hypothetical community can have no
tax base anyway.&nbsp; Whatever labor or capital it tries to tax will
leave, or never arrive, because their supplies are elastic.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Capital will only appear to bear a tax if it can shift it to
land in
the form of lower rent, or a lower purchase price.&nbsp; If rent and
land values are already zero, there is nowhere to shift a tax.&nbsp;
Mobile factors will not bear it, but turn away.&nbsp; Customers will
not bear it, but buy elsewhere.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seligman does not consider the interesting
possibility that public services paid by taxation might create the very
rents that are taxed to support the public services.&nbsp; That complex
question would make an interesting book, but one too long to insert
here.</small><br>
<br>
<small>b.&nbsp; The surplus is much more than usually stated.</small><br>
<small>... The failure of modern economists, whether
neo-classical or heterodox, to acknowledge the Himalayan Range of land
values in their faces, and to reckon its role in theory and policy, is
denial and delusion on a scale at which one can only
marvel.&nbsp;&nbsp; ....</small><br>
<br>
<small>Amassing land is always done, can only be
done, by shrinking the
holdings of others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt.&nbsp; If A is to
have
more then B, C, D <i>et al. </i>must have less, there is no other
way.&nbsp; A can amass more capital by saving, creating new capital,
leaving B, C, D <i>et al. </i>with as much as before.&nbsp; A can
increase his labor income by working longer, or harder, or smarter,
producing more, leaving others with as much as before.&nbsp; He and she
together can also spawn more children: labor, like capital, is
reproducible, and indefinitely augmentable.&nbsp; Possessing land,
however, means just one thing: bumping others.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the region of the mind, the thing possessed may be shared by
all
with
no diminution to anyone.&nbsp; No one's pleasure In Shakespeare, or
Beethoven, or understanding physics is any less because at the same
time
millions of others have the same pleasure.&nbsp; Art, letters and
science
are the common property of mankind, open to all who care to acquire
them.&nbsp; The
creative producer's pleasure is in proportion to the number with whom
he
shares.&nbsp; The gratification is from sharing, not excluding.&nbsp;
The
contrast with landholding is nearly total.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">35</span></small></small><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small><font size="-1">35.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Paraphrased

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small>Amassing claims on wealth by creating and producing is not,
therefore,
a
threat to others.&nbsp; Amassing capital through saving does not weaken
or impoverish others.&nbsp; Producing goods does not interfere with
others' doing the same.&nbsp; One producer may drive another from a
particular limited market, but glutting one market increases real
demand
for the products of other markets, and raises the real value of others'
incomes by lowering prices.&nbsp; Amassing land, however, has to
deprive
others, both relatively and absolutely.&nbsp; Concentrated holding and
control of land, therefore, have always been threats to the well-being
of
those left out.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Conversely, the only way the landless, e.g. in South Africa, can
get
land
is from those who now have it.&nbsp; "Growth" is often advanced
as the solution to maldistribution, injustice and poverty, but that is
mere temporizing because land does not grow.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; When production and
demand grow, land rents rise.&nbsp; Of land it is starkly true, "the
problem is not production, but distribution".&nbsp; There is no
production; only distribution. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Consuming </span><b>land
means preempting its
time</b></small><br>
<small>To consume most goods and services is to use them
up.&nbsp; Land is
not used up.&nbsp; "Consuming" land must have some other
meaning, therefore, than the intuitive and common idea that consuming
means turning-to-waste.&nbsp; To consume land is rather to preempt its
service flow without impairing its substance.&nbsp; To consume land is
to
occupy it for a time-slot, which may be as brief as
beating a red light or (rarely) as long as the pyramids last.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">40</span></small>&nbsp;
After
us life goes on, on the land once left to us which we then leave to
others. "Time-sharing" was not invented by the holiday industry but is
inherent in the nature of land and life.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>40. The other six
"Wonders of
the Ancient World" have all disappeared without a trace.&nbsp; Relative
to land, human works are evanescent.&nbsp; "Like snow upon the desert's
dusty face, lighting a little hour or two" they are gone.
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>How shall we measure land-consumption by owners, where no rent
is
paid?&nbsp; Is it purely subjective?&nbsp; Does it vary with the
owner's
mood and health?&nbsp; It is simpler than that, and fully
practicable.&nbsp; The essence of consuming land is preempting the
time-slot from others.&nbsp; Thus, holding land without using it, or
using it below capacity, is a form of consumption.&nbsp; The measure is
the market opportunity cost of land, i.e. the price times the interest
rate.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Holding an urban site has been likened to holding a reserved
seat at a
play, sporting event, or concert.&nbsp; The ticket holder properly
helps
pay for the event, whether or not he is there to enjoy it.&nbsp; As a
result, very few paid customers fail to show up.&nbsp; Likewise, people
who pay cash rent for land seldom leave it vacant.&nbsp; Doubtless if
people paid regular cash taxes to hold land, they, too, would consume
(preempt) less.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... </small><small><b>Land's rent is its opportunity cost,
regardless of
use</b></small><br>
<small>Land is a prior claimant on the product.&nbsp; This has
been
obscured by calling rent "a residual."&nbsp; Land income is not a
residual, but a prior claimant.&nbsp; This means land rent is a much
larger share of national income than national. accounts presently show.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The unreaped harvests of idle land flow like water wasting
through a desert into a salt sea.&nbsp; Lost water may sometimes be
useful downstream; lost time never returns.&nbsp; To keep others from
using a time-slot is to consume it.</small><br>
<br>
<small>A great deal of land in fact is not allocated to its highest and
best
use.&nbsp; The value of preempting this land is the highest and best
use
that might have been made of the land preempted.&nbsp; That is the
economic cost.&nbsp; The land is not responsible if the manager
fails to realize its value at optimal capacity.&nbsp; Neither are the
persons who are excluded.&nbsp; Only the preemptor is responsible, as a
manager.&nbsp; This person is the residual imputee who deserves credit
for performing above par and blame for failing below.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Most economic theorizing has failed to bring out this
point.&nbsp; The
tendency is to treat ground rent as a residual, a waste basket for all
the errors and dereliction of responsible economic actors.&nbsp; (Note
dereliction of those who say cost is opportunity
cost, but fail to apply that properly to land, when estimating its
value.)&nbsp; This has resulted in greatly understating the value of
land relative to other factors of production.&nbsp;
Institutional and social factors, too, often obscure the opportunity
cost
of land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This is a case where theorizing lags behind practice.&nbsp; In
dividing
value between land and a building affixed to it the standard practice
of
appraisers, and speculative buyers too, is the "building-residual
method." The land is appraised as though vacant; the building gets
the remaining value, if any.&nbsp; The building, once attached to a
specific site, loses the mobility of place and form that fluid capital
possesses and has no opportunity cost but scrap value, which is often
negative.&nbsp; Land, always lacking mobility of place, retains
mobility
of reuse because of its versatility, permanence, and irreproducible
location. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Read the whole article</a><br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I premise resource rents are the
joint product of three
distinguishable factors:
</small></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Triffin's epigram says <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"Surpluses are either competed away or
imputed away." Rent is what we call it when they are imputed away. He
might have added, they may also be frittered away: that is what we
seek to avoid.</span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Imputed rent is the foregone gain
of withholding land from the
market, i.e. from others. It is equal to the marginal product of
land. I premise (some others differ) that rent is the prior
distributive claim, not a "residual." Thus, unused valuable land
costs the owner as much rent as though he were paying cash to a
landlord. Failure to realize this rent is imputable to management,
not land as such.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rent is a levelized concept to
give a unitary, commensurable
expression to costs and yields that have variable time patterns.
Selecting time patterns optimally is part of maximizing rent. That is<span
 style="font-style: italic;">
a fortiori </span>true of exhaustible resources.<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A. Dissipation
means waste and destruction or suppression.&nbsp; </b>It means
incurring needless costs, or aborting surplus-yielding activities.
Redistribution is not, per se, dissipation. No incentive is required to
produce land, or able to make more be created, so who collects rent is
a distributive choice. However the manner of collection may twist
incentives and interfere with efficient use; so may the method of
tenure, or tenure-creation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>B. How rent is
dissipated. </b>Open access, tragedy of commons. Arthur Young, Scott
Gordon, Garrett Hardin, et al. Simple cases like open range, fisheries,
public parks and beaches, freeways: a principle easily perceived
(although not usually by undergraduates).</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>C. Open access
followed by tenure: rent-seeking institutions.</b></small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rent is dissipated
through prematurity of investments. Squatters' Rights (<b>Preemption
Act of 1841</b>), and residence requirement of <b>Homestead Act (1862)</b>,
traditional examples. Prior appropriation doctrine of water rights,
simple example. Air routes; broadcast licenses; extending utility
franchises; zoning; offset rights to pollute; other modern examples. </small>
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Offset rights to pollute
are doubly effective in dissipating rent.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">By generating a nuisance and
lowering the value of surrounding land, a polluter is rewarded by
receiving a valuable vested right to continue the nuisance in
perpetuity, or sell it.</span></small></p>

  <p><small>Internationally, rent-seeking via warfare, or big-stick
policies threatening warfare, may be seen to dissipate rent when we
deduct the public cost from the private gain. <small

Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
</small>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>In real estate there are two basic
tautologies. 
</small></font></small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>One, land value is
unrealized rent and rent is realized land value. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Two, the annual rental
income from a parcel is its market price multiplied by the interest
rate, and land price is capitalized land rent (usually over a 30 year
term). Since collecting land rent shrinks, even eliminates, land price,
it becomes necessary to determine annual rent and use that as a basis
for the rate on land.</small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which
in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Rent, Transform Society</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If society decided to share
among its members all the
annual value of society's sites and resources and air space, what
would happen? </small><br>
<br>
<small>... <span style="font-weight: bold;">It doesn't matter who owns
what. What
matters is who gets the rent.</span> We have millions of acres of
forest we Americans own together, and we are losing rent on it.&nbsp;
... </small><br>
<br>
<small>... Assuming that is true, <span style="font-weight: bold;">if
not
allowed to collect in the wrong pockets, but redirected to
everybody's pockets,</span> we can expect a solution.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the past, land owners owed
services to king, but in
this age of equality then we owe our neighbors. We have an equal
right to the earth. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The community creates rent.</span>
Land value rises when
infrastructure goes on land. Technology progresses when the community
becomes more tranquil and density goes up. Density is a really good
measure of land value. No one owner by
himself is responsible for density. Rent from land value is justified
because all should share in the rent. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If the community collected the
rent, it would motivate
owners not to speculate in anticipation of a higher future return.
There would be a tendency to infill in the city and make cities
more efficient.</span> It would make mass transit more efficient.&nbsp;

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Left_Must.html">What the Left Must
Do: Share the Surplus</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Meanwhile, ignoring our common
assets guarantees that we continue to
pay rent rather than begin to receive rent. Conversely, insisting upon
a fair share could <span style="font-weight: bold;">win us the world
we want</span>. While it breaks an old habit to leave jobs behind in
favour of fair distribution, just recognizing surplus empowers people.
It reaffirms the very existence of our commonwealth and challenges the
narrow view of property as exclusively private. While the Left gets
excoriated for wanting to be big spenders, demanding a dividend in lieu
of waste and a shift of taxes from individual effort to social surplus
helps refurbish the Left&#8217;s image.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The call to share the commonwealth enjoys an unshakable moral
base and
gets high marks for real world success, unlike taxes upon true
earnings. Once implemented, sharing rent will grant us leisure &#8211; time
enough to evolve and reconnect with friends, family, and neighbours &#8211;
and drain away fortunes rather than let the fortunate continue to soak
society. Hence support for shifting taxes and paying dividends to the
citizenry grows already, without the Left&#8217;s leadership. It&#8217;s time to
run with the banner of an extra income for everyone, in the halls and
capitols of governments everywhere. To liberate humans from exploitive
labor, let us advance the sharing of society&#8217;s surplus. <a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and
automobile.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the
public, governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies. Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now wipe out the taxes, subsidies,
liability limits, and rent
retention. Instead, replace all that with running government like a
business. Charge full-market value for state acknowledgements (the
seven secret subsidies):

<small>Collecting rent for
government-granted privileges would not only raise trillions but also
whittle corporations down to a competitive size, less hazardous to
democracy. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides charging what privileges
are worth, government should also
replace license with responsibility ("internalize the
externalities"). To temper the temptation to use lands both fragile
and valuable, society could impose surcharges - an Ecology Security
Deposit, Restoration Insurance, Emission Permits, and fines when
users exceed standards. To minimize all these charges, producers
would seek sustainable alternatives. Getting and sharing rent from
land titles is the centerpiece of this geonomic revenue reform. Each
phase of such a revenue shift motivates sustainable choices in its
own way.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Noticing rent, realizing its
social nature, accepting that it's to
be shared, and understanding that wages and interest should not be
expropriated, for most people that's a new way of thinking. Thinking
such thoughts leads to a new way of conceiving economics, too.
Ecological economics becomes not just a branch of economics but a
whole new discipline, needing a new name. In geonomics we maintain
the distinction between items bearing exchange value that come into
being by human effort - wealth - and those that don't - land. Keeping
this distinction in the forefront makes it obvious and
non-controversial that speculating in land drives sprawl, that
hoarding land retards Third World development, that borrowing to buy
land plus buildings engorges banks, that so-called "interest" is
quasi-rent, that the cost of land inflates faster than the price of
produced goods and services, that over half of corporate profit, says
the Urban Land Institute, is from real estate. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Summing up these analyses, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geonomists offer a Grand Unifying
Theory, that the flow of rent pulls all other indicators in its wake.
</span>Geonomics differs from economics as chemistry from alchemy, as
astronomy from astrology. The acid test of any science is prediction,
a test that economics fails and geonomics passes. Plugging in the
land price cycle of 17+ years lets geonomists crank out predictions
more accurate than those generated by "the experts" who missed, for
example, the collapse of mighty Japan. When the land of the Rising
Sun was on the market for four times the assessed value of all
America, that's when a few geonomists, like voices in the wilderness,
countered conventional wisdom by proclaiming that the Japanese boom
would bust. According to these geonomic prognosticators, don't expect
America's next downturn for at least another five years, despite the
tech wreck or any other stock market fluctuations. </small><small>...&nbsp;

<p>Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Leaking.html">Leaking Economic
Value of Communities</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wearing pajamas outdoors in the
winter, one wouldn&#8217;t expect
to retain body heat. Yet, people do try to sustain community while
hemorrhaging its commonwealth. Losing it, residents must work more
than necessary.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When residents import food and
energy, they deprive others in the
community of income. Yet, the loss pales when compared to paying
mortgages and [income] taxes. A recent
study of Oakland, CA found torrents of dollars pumped out of town
headed for the treasuries of distant capitols and the bank vaults of
distant lenders.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While mortgages and interest
elevate an elite elsewhere, they keep
debtors on a treadmill at home. To those anxious over every next
payment, how appealing is an economy no longer expanding its girth?
In addition, what&#8217;s their debt for? Credit? The total savings of
all members of a community should suffice. Local bank "used to" be
the norm.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other major drain, taxes, at
about 40% of the average
worker&#8217;s income, usually total more than the value of government
services received. And who receives them? Corporate loggers, miners,
factory farms, and tractor trailers. Lose such subsidies, leveling
the playing field, and local recyclers, family farmers, and freight
haulers could compete. Their success would plug the visible leaks -
imported food, energy, and materials.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While a community might not be
able to command a distant capitol
to turn off the subsidies, a locality may be able to avoid federal
and state taxes. ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cutting out outsiders&#8217; taxes means
the locality would have to
take over providing the outsiders&#8217; services: nuclear power
plants, toxic dumps, scarifying freeways, submarines, whatever. To
pay for whatever desired services, from where will the city or county
get the money? From themselves, their commonwealth. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It&#8217;s the
money they spend on the nature they use, the prices and rents paid
for sites and resources.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How
can communities capture that flow of natural values and keep
it circulating locally? Get local government to charge some kind of
land use fee.</span> Depending on state law, the locality could replace
the
property tax with a site value tax, raise the fee for defending
deeds, levy a fee for resource use, and/or resurrect ancient land
dues.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Community, where we live, and
economy, how we live, cannot be
separated. As long as communities leak economic value, they cannot
sustain themselves in a steady-state, like the skinny guy with a
tapeworm wondering why he&#8217;s always hungry. By reclaiming land
values, a community plugs its leaks so residents can sustain the
lives of nature and neighborhood. ...&nbsp; <a

<p>Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">What To Do About
the Real Estate Bubble</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What&#8217;s bubbling, and until when?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Sellers are happy. So are developers and speculators. Real estate has
gone all bubbly, and that bubble has gone ballistic. What goes up,
however, must soon do something else.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Actually, it&#8217;s not housing whose price has entered the
stratosphere. Buildings age &#8211; get older, more worn out. What&#8217;s getting
more valuable is the land, the location &#8211; whether it has a building on
it or not. Buildings you can make more of, but land you can not,
especially locations along the coasts or on the good side of town. None
of that would matter if you could ever get buildings to hover around in
the air. Meanwhile however, speculators are happy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... What&#8217;s seemingly good for landowners is not necessarily good
for the economy. As people spend more on land, something nobody
produced, they spend less on output, things people do produce. As
producers get less money spent on their products, eventually they take
the hint and produce less. "Produce less" is another way of spelling
recession.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Plus, more expensive land means heavier borrowing to buy it.
More debt means more inflation and less stability. When producers cut
back, borrowers have a much harder time paying back their debts. As
people go bankrupt, they drag others down with them. A collapsing house
of cards is another way of spelling depression.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preventing bubbles?</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If land values didn&#8217;t get
inflated, of
course they would not have to get deflated.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Call it mutual compensation for
deprivation from part of our common natural heritage. </span> While in
rhythmic
systems, prices must rise and fall, but they need not boom then bust;
they could climb then glide. What would temper economies, preventing
bubbles? Rather than let a few lucky owners collect land values,
neighbors would have to recover land values for themselves. Nobody made
land, and no lone owner made its value; the presence of society in
general did that. Plus, for excluding everyone else from their sites,
owners owe everyone else, as each one of us owes everyone for excluding
them. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To recover land value,
government
could either transform the property tax into a land tax or replace it
and other taxes with land dues or land use fees or an annual deed fee.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To pay the land dues, owners use their
land efficiently; owners who had been speculating get busy and develop.</span>
No longer allowed to tax anything that moves, local governments, too,
which presently let acres of abandoned urban land and buildings lie
fallow, get busy, too, and make sure to get those acres into the hands
of ambitious owners who&#8217;ll pay land dues. More locations put to use and
more buildings put up increases supply, which dampens price.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Better still, as government recovers
land rent, that leaves owners with less land rent to capitalize into
land price. Hence buyers need not borrow so much.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Land would still rise in value. With
every discovery of a nearby natural resource. With the opening of every
new bridge. With every techno-advance, as silicon wafers did for
Silicon Valley. With every jump in income and drop in crime, land value
rises. But no longer into a bubble. Because every rise would find its
way &#8211; via land dues and rent dividends &#8211; into everyone&#8217;s pockets. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
If the 18-year average holds for this cycle, then real estate still has
a few more years of sucking all the investments and purchasing power
out of the rest of the economy. Land is still able to soak it all up,
and lenders are still willing to pump more in. So despite the premature
panic (markets almost never do what everybody says they&#8217;re going to
do), Mankiw&#8217;s 2007 would be the earliest that the current bubble would
burst, and 2008 is just as likely.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Then land prices will fall for a few years. Since the run-up was steep,
the drop will be, too &#8211; after correcting for inflation, maybe as much
as 50%. Which will be an enormous relief for the economy &#8211; just what
the doctor ordered. With land affordable again, a new cycle can get
under way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether the new one will
be boom and bust or climb and glide is up to us, whether we&#8217;re willing
to practice geonomics, to forego taxes and subsidies in favor of land
dues and a Citizens Dividend.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While I don&#8217;t mind the current
gambling, I do mind the widening of the cavernous gulf between haves
and have-nots, and I boil over while workweek grows more onerous, and
just seethe watching vacant lots and abandoned buildings push
development out from urban cores to sprawl on suburban farmland. To
reverse that, let&#8217;s let go of the individual owner&#8217;s hold on land rent
and share Earth&#8217;s worth equitably among us all. We&#8217;ll all be glad we
did. </span>...<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Smith_Bubble.html">&nbsp; <big><big><small><small><span

Gains Debate</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>On the other hand, the
Fed statistics<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37</span></small>
understate land values for methodological reasons. Starting with
estimates for overall real estate market prices, Fed statisticians
subtract estimated replacement prices for existing buildings and
capital improvements to derive land values as a residual. These
replacement prices are based on the Commerce Department&#8217;s index of
construction costs. Thus, building values are estimated to increase
steadily over time, on the implicit assumption that all such property
is worth reproducing at today&#8217;s rising costs.</small></div>

U.S.
Economy, 1945-94, Tables B. 11, B. 12 and R 11.</font></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>However, the value of any building tends
eventually to decline,
until finally it is scrapped and replaced. It is the value of land
which tends to rise as population and income grow (over the long run,
with cyclical swings), precisely because no more land can be produced.
Thus, capital gains in real estate result mainly from land appreciation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Building values fall because of physical deterioration, but also
because buildings undergo locational obsolescence as neighborhood land
uses change over time, so market prices tend to fall below replacement
costs. It would not be economical to rebuild many types of structures
on the same site if they were suddenly destroyed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">38</span></small> In
particular, where land use is intensifying over the long run, rising
land values effectively drain the capital value out of old buildings.
This is because the salvage value of land (its worth upon renewal)
tends to rise, while the scrap or salvage value of most immovable
improvements is negligible. Where land has alternative uses, rent is
not its current net income but its opportunity cost -- the minimum
yield
required by the market to warrant keeping the land in its present use
instead of converting it to the best alternative use. As the land value
rises, a rising share of the property income must be imputed to the
land and a falling share remains to be imputed to the improvements.<a

<p>  Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
Land for the People</a> (1889 speech)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <small>I said that rent is a natural thing. So it is. Where one man, all rights
      being equal, has a piece of land of better quality than another man, it is
      only fair to all that he should pay the difference. Where one man has a piece
      of land and others have none, it gives him a special advantage; it is only
      fair that he should pay into the common fund the value of that special privilege
      granted him
    by the community. That is what is called <b>economic rent</b>.<br>
    <br>
    BUT over and above the economic rent there is the power that comes by monopoly,
    there is the power to extract a rent, which may be
    called <b>monopoly rent</b>. On this island that I have supposed we go and
    settle on, under the plan we have proposed each man should pay annually to
    the special
    fund in accordance with the special privilege the peculiar value of the piece
    of land he held, and those who had land of no peculiar value should pay nothing.
    That rent that would be payable by the individual to the community would
    only amount to the value of the special privilege that he enjoyed from the
    community.
    But if one man owned the island, and if we went there and you people were
    fools enough to allow me to lay claim to the ownership of the island and
    say it belonged
    to me, then I could charge a monopoly rent; I could make you pay me every
    penny that you earned, save just enough for you to live; and the reason I
    could not
    make you pay more
    is simply this, that if you would pay more you would die.&nbsp; </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>THE power to exact that monopoly rent comes from the power to hold land
    idle -- comes from the power to keep labor off the land. Tax up land to its full
    value and that power would be gone; the richest landowners could not afford to
    hold valuable land idle. Everywhere that simple plan would compel the landowner
    either to use his land or to sell out to some one who would; and the rent of
    land would then fall to its true economic rate--the value of the special privilege
    it gave would go not to individuals, but to the general community, to be used
    for the benefit of the whole community.<strong>&nbsp;... &nbsp;</strong> </small></p>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <b>THE way to secure
equality is plain. It is not by dividing the
land; it is by calling upon those who are allowed possession of
pieces of land giving special advantage to pay to the whole
community, the rest of the people, aye, and including themselves--to
the whole people, a fair rent or premium for that privilege, and
using the fund so obtained for the benefit of the whole people.
</b>What we would do would be to make the whole people the general
landlord, to have whatever rent is paid for the use of land to go,
not into the pockets of individual landlords, but into the treasury
of the general community, where it could be used for the common
benefit.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, rent is a natural and just
thing. For instance, if we in this
room were to go together to a new country and we were to agree that
we should settle in that new country on equal terms, how could we
divide the land up in such a way as to insure and to continue
equality? If it were proposed that we should divide it up into equal
pieces, there would be in the first place this objection, that in our
division we would not fully know the character of the land; one man
would get a more valuable piece than the other. Then as time passed
the value of different pieces of land would change, and further than
that if we were once to make a division and then allow full and
absolute ownership of the land, inequality would come up in the
succeeding generation. One man would be thriftless, another man, on
the contrary, would be extremely keen in saving and pushing; one man
would be unfortunate and another man more fortunate; and so on. In a
little while many of these people would have parted with their land
to others, so that their children coming after them into the world
would have no land. The only fair way would be this-- that any man
among us should be at liberty to take up any piece of land, and use
it, that no one else wanted to use; that where more than one man
wanted to use the same piece of land, the man who did use it should
pay a premium which, going into a common fund and being used for the
benefit of all, would put everybody upon a plane of equality. That
would be the ideal way of dividing up the land of a new country.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE problem is how to apply that
to an old country. True we are
confronted with this fact all over the civilized world that a certain
class have got possession of the land, and want to hold it. Now one
of your distinguished leaders, Mr. Parnell in his Drogheda speech
some years ago, said there were only two ways of getting the land for
the people. One way was to buy it; the other was to fight for it. I
do not think that is true. I think that Mr. Parnell overlooked at
that time a most important <b>third way</b>, and that is the way we
advocate.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>That is what we propose by what
we call the single tax. We
propose to abolish all taxes for revenue. In place of all the taxes
that are now levied, to impose one single tax, and that a tax upon
the value of land.</b> Mark me, upon the value of land alone -- not
upon the value of improvements, not upon the value of what the
exercise of labor has done to make land valuable, that belongs to the
individual; but upon the value of the land itself, irrespective of
the improvements, so that an acre of land that has not been improved
will pay as much tax as an acre of like land that has been improved.
So that in a town a house site on which there is no building shall be
called upon to pay just as much tax as a house site on which there is
a house.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I said that rent is a natural
thing. So it is. Where one man, all
rights being equal, has a piece of land of better quality than
another man, it is only fair to all that he should pay the
difference. Where one man has a piece of land and others have none,
it gives him a special advantage; it is only fair that he should pay
into the common fund the value of that special privilege granted him
by the community. That is what is called <b>economic rent</b>.</small>  <small>BUT over and above the economic rent there is the power that
comes
by monopoly, there is the power to extract a rent, which may be
called <b>monopoly rent</b>. On this island that I have supposed we
go and settle on, under the plan we have proposed each man should pay
annually to the special fund in accordance with the special privilege
the peculiar value of the piece of land he held, and those who had
land of no peculiar value should pay nothing. That rent that would be
payable by the individual to the community would only amount to the
value of the special privilege that he enjoyed from the community.
But <span style="font-weight: bold;">if one man owned the island, and
if we went there and you people
were fools enough to allow me to lay claim to the ownership of the
island and say it belonged to me, then I could charge a monopoly
rent; I could make you pay me every penny that you earned, save just
enough for you to live; and the reason I could not make you pay more
is simply this, that if you would pay more you would die.&nbsp; </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>THE power to exact that monopoly rent comes from the power to
hold
land idle -- comes from the power to keep labor off the land. Tax up
land to its full value and that power would be gone; the richest
landowners could not afford to hold valuable land idle. Everywhere
that simple plan would compel the landowner either to use his land or
to sell out to some one who would; and the rent of land would then
fall to its true economic rate--the value of the special privilege it
gave would go not to individuals, but to the general community, to be
used for the benefit of the whole community.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I cannot pass on without
mentioning the name of one of the
distinguished Irishmen who have declared for the principle long
before they heard of me. I refer to only one name. Many of you know,
and doubtless all of you have heard, of Dr. Nulty, the Bishop of
Meath.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IN 1881, before I had ever been in
Ireland or Dr. Nulty had ever
heard of me, he wrote <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">a
letter on the Land Question to the clergy and laity of the diocese of
Meath</a>. Dr. Nulty lays down precisely the principle that I have
endeavored to lay down here before you briefly, that there is a right
of ownership that comes from work, from production; that it is the
law of nature, the law of God, </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>that all men should work; </small></li>
  <li><small>that what a man produces by his labor belongs to him; </small></li>
  <li><small>that the reservoir from which everything must come -- the
land
itself -- can belong to no man, and </small></li>
  <li><small>that its proper treatment is just as I have proposed to
let there
be security of possession and to let those who have special privileges
pay into the common fund for those privileges, and to use that fund for
the benefit of all. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Dr. Nulty goes on to say what
every man who has studied this
subject will cordially endorse, that <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the natural law of rent -- that
law by which population increases the value of land in certain places
and makes it grow higher and higher -- that principle by which, as
the city grows, land becomes more valuable -- that that is to his
mind </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the clearest
and best proof, not merely of the intelligence but
of the beneficence of the Creator</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> For he shows clearly that
that is
the natural provision by virtue of which, if men would only obey
God's law of justice, if men would only obey the fundamental maxim of
Christianity to do to others as they would be done to them: that by
virtue of that provision, as the advance of civilization went on, it
would be towards a greater and greater equality among men-not a now
to a more and more monstrous inequality.&nbsp; <a

<p>The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
  (Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a> (1881)&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>How Political Economists
Define Rent</b>
</small><br>
<small>Adam Smith says: "Rent may be considered as the produce of those
powers of nature the use of which the landlord lends to the farmer.
It is the work of nature which remains after deducting or
compensating all that can be regarded as the work of man. It is
seldom less than a fourth, and frequently more than a third of the
whole produce." The part then of the agricultural products of the
land which is the result of the operations of the powers of nature is
sometimes more than a third of the whole -- and that is the Rent of
the landlord.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Ricardo, the inventor of the
celebrated theory of Rent, called
after his name (Ricardo's "Theory of Rent"), defines Rent to be:
"That portion of the produce of the earth which is paid to the
landlord for the use of the original and indestructible powers of the
soil. It is often confounded with the interest and profit of
capital&#8230; In the future pages of this work, then, whenever I
speak of the Rent of land, I wish to be understood as speaking of the
compensation which is paid to the owner of the land for the use of
its original and indestructible properties."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Scrope writes of it: "The value of
land and its power of yielding
a Rent are due to two circumstances. 1. The appropriation of its
natural power. 2. The labour applied to its amelioration. Under the
first of these relations Rent is a monopoly. It restricts our
<span style="font-weight: bold;">usufruct </span>and enjoyment of the
gifts which God has given to men for
the satisfaction of their wants."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Senior thus speaks of Rent: "The
instruments of production are
labour and natural agents. Natural agents having been appropriated,
proprietors charge for their use under the form of Rent, which is the
recompense of no sacrifice whatever, and is received by those who
have neither laboured nor put by, but who merely hold out their hands
to accept the offerings of the rest of the community."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>McCulloch defines it: "What is
properly termed Rent is the sum
paid for the use of the natural and inherent powers of the soil. It
is entirely distinct from the sum paid for the use of buildings,
enclosures, roads or other ameliorations." Rent is, then, always a
monopoly.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Lastly, Mill says: "The land
is the principal of the natural
agents which are capable of being appropriated, and the consideration
paid for its use is called Rent. . . .It is at once evident that Rent
is the effect of a monopoly."&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

A.J.O. [probably Mark Twain]: <a href="../docs/ajo_slavery.html">Slavery</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Suppose I am the owner of an
  estate and 100 slaves, all the land
  about being held in the same way by people of the same class as
  myself.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
  <small>Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes me. I reflect that there is no
  unoccupied land in the neighbourhood, so that if my laborers were
  free they would still have to look to me for work somehow.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small>    </p>
  <p><small>Most of them think they would like to have a piece of land and
      work it for themselves, and be their own masters.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
    <small> "But," softly I observe, "you are going too fast. Your
      proposals
      about the tools and seed and your maintenance are all right enough,
      but the land, you remember, belongs to me. You cannot expect me to
      give you your liberty and my own land for nothing. That would not be
    reasonable, would it?"&nbsp; ... </small><br>
    <small>Still I am ready to do what I promised &#8212; "to employ as many
      as I may require, on such terms as we may mutually and independently
    agree."&nbsp; ... </small><br>
    <small>So they all set to at the old work at the old place, and on the
      old terms, only a little differently administered; that is, that
      whereas I formerly supplied them with food, clothes, etc., direct
      from my stores, I now give them a weekly wage representing the value
      of those articles, which they will henceforth have to buy for
  themselves.<strong> ...</strong></small>  </p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Instead of being forced to keep my
men in brutish ignorance, I
find public schools established at other people's expense to
stimulate their intelligence and improve their minds, to my great
advantage, and their children compelled to attend these schools. The
service I get, too, being now voluntarily rendered (or apparently so)
is much improved in quality. In short, the arrangement pays me better
in many ways.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>REJOICE! I AM CAPITAL AND I
EMPLOY PEOPLE!</small></center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I gain in other ways besides
pecuniary benefit. I have lost
the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
benevolence. I am a "large employer of labour," to whom the whole
country, and the labourer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
say, "See the power of capital! These poor labourers, having no
capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
country, and his own fortune together."</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whereas it is not my capital
that does any of these things.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small>But now another thought strikes me. Instead of paying an
overseer
to work these men for me, I will make him pay me for the privilege of
doing it. I will let the land as it stands to him or to another
&#8212; to whomsoever will give the most for the billet. He shall be
called my tenant instead of my overseer, but the things he shall do
for me are essentially the same, only done by contract instead of for
yearly pay.&nbsp; <strong>.... </strong></small><br>
<small>For a moderate reduction in my profits, then &#8212; a reduction
equal to the tenant's narrow margin of profit &#8212; I have all the
toil and worry of management taken off my hands, and the risk too,
for be the season good or bad, the rent is bound to be forthcoming,
and I can sell him up to the last rag if he fails of the full amount,
no matter for what reason; and my rent takes precedence of all other
debts.<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If wages are forced down it is not
I that do it; it is that greedy
and merciless man the employer (my tenant) who does it. I am a lofty
and superior being, dwelling apart and above such sordid
considerations. I would never dream of grinding these poor labourers,
not I! I have nothing to do with them at all; <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">I only want my rent --
and
get it. </span><b>Like the lillies of the field, I toil not, neither
do I
spin, and yet (so kind is Providence!) my daily bread (well buttered)
comes to me of itself. </b>Nay, people bid against each other for the
privilege of finding it for me; and no one seems to realise that the
comfortable income that falls to me like the refreshing dew is dew
indeed; but it is the dew of sweat wrung from the labourers' toil. It
is the fruit of their labour which they ought to have; which they
would have if I did not take it from them.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This sketch illustrates the fact
that chattel slavery is not the
only nor even the worst form of bondage. When the use of the earth
&#8212; the sole source of our daily bread &#8212; is denied unless one
pays a fellow creature for permission to use it, people are bereft of
economic freedom. The only way to regain that freedom is to collect
the rent of land instead of taxes for the public domain.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, labour leaders
in the USA, the UK and Australia
understood these facts. The labour movements of those countries were
filled with people who fought for the principles of 'the single tax'
on land at the turn of the twentieth century. But since then, it has
been ridiculed, and they have gradually yielded to the forces of
privilege and power &#8212; captives of the current hegemony &#8212;
daring no longer to come to grips with this fundamental question,
lest they, too, become ridiculed.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And so the world continues to

a synopsis of Robert V. Andelson and James M. Dawsey: <a
 href="../docs/Andelson_FWTPL_syn.html">From
Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The
profit of the earth is for all" (Eccles. 5:9). The Old Testament ethic,
to assure everyone the same natural opportunity, asserts that all
people have an equal right to economic rent, and the Levite tithe
demonstrates that the socialization of rent offsets the ethical and
practical harm resulting from private land ownership. But there is
another basis for its advocacy: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent
should be taken by society because it is a social product. Rent arises
in large measure from two societal phenomena: the mere presence of
population, and community activity in a particular area. </span>More
people means more demand for space on which to live and work. Community
activities such as roads, schools, protection, parks, sewage, utilities
and other public services, as well as the totality of private
commercial and cultural operations, all make land more productive or
desirable. It follows that a community which funds such improvements
out of its rent fund will be provided with a stable and growing fund
with which to maintain and improve them. And unlike conventional taxes,
the collection of this fund will enhance, not penalize, the production
of wealth.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Individuals, in their bare
capacity as
landowners, do nothing to produce land value. By withholding sites from
use, whether for speculation or for other reasons, they may generate
scarcity, artificially inflating rent, but this does not reflect any
positive contribution to production on the part of landowners.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>While land value is not the only type of unearned increment,
unearned
income resulting from such advantages as talent, genes or luck is not
at the expense of others. Even Karl Marx admitted: "The monopoly of
property in land is even the basis of the monopoly of capital." Marx
could have -- but did not -- champion the abolition of land monopoly;
instead he advocated its transfer from private into state hands. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It was left to Henry George to expound how
the universal principles of justice found in the Mosaic model could be
applied to the modern age in all its economic aspects -- rural and
urban, agricultural and industrial, technologically undeveloped or
advanced.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What George advocated was to
leave
land titles in private hands but to appropriate land rent via the
existing machinery of property taxation. "I do not propose either to
purchase or to confiscate private property in land. The first would be
unjust; the second, needless....It is not necessary to confiscate land;
it is only necessary to confiscate rent." No owner or tenant would be
expropriated or evicted. No limit would be placed on the quantity of
land one could hold, as long as the annual rent were paid.</span></small><br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coordinately with the
capture
of rent as public revenue, taxes on products of human labor --
improvements, personal property, services, commodities, wages, etc. --
would be reduced and ultimately eliminated.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small>George considered his remedy no mere human contrivance. He saw
the
growth of land value and the easy means of equitably distributing it as
an expression of benevolent supernatural design: "As civilization goes
on... so do the common wants increase and so does the necessity for
public revenue arise. And so in that value which attaches to land, not
by reason of anything the individual does, but by reason of the growth
of the community, is a provision intended -- we may safely say intended
-- to meet that social want."</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">George's remedy goes a long way
to
stop current inequity and prevent future inequity. While past inequity,
in the form of accumulations of capital based on previous land
speculation and monopoly cannot be accurately redressed, these fortunes
can be impelled to serve the needs of the public via investment in
production, not by further investment in land speculation and
monopoly.&nbsp; ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>To
recognize that "the earth is the Lord's" is to see that the same God
who established communities has also in his providence ordained for
them, through the land itself, a just source of revenue. Yet, in the
Wasteland in which we live, this revenue goes mainly into the pockets
of monopolists, while communities meet their needs by extorting
individuals the fruits of their honest toil. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If ever there were any doubt that
structural sin exists, our present system of taxation is the proof.
Everywhere we see governments penalizing individuals for their industry
and creativity, while the socially produced value of land is reaped by
speculators in exact proportion to the land which they withhold. The
greater the Wasteland, the greater the reward. Does this comport with
any divine plan, or notion of justice and human rights? Or does it not,
rather, perpetuate the Wasteland and prevent the realization of the
Promised Land?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This not meant to suggest that land monopolists and speculators
have a
corner on acquisitiveness or the "profit motive," which is a well-nigh
universal fact of human nature. As a group, they are no more sinful
than are people at large, except to the degree that they knowingly
obstruct reforms aimed at removing the basis of exploitation. Many
abide by the dictum: "If one has to live under a corrupt system, it is
better to be a beneficiary than a victim of it."</small><br>
<br>
<small>But they do not have to live under a corrupt system; no one
does. The
profit motive can be channeled in ways that are socially desirable as
well as in ways that are socially destructive. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Let us give testimony to our faith that the
earth is the Lord's by building a social order in which there are no
victims.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><a

month. There was one acre each for 8, 6, and 4, and 100 acres of
2-bushel land. For 8 hours per day of labor, he could work 4 acres. So
he could grow, per month, 8+6+4+2 = 20 bushels of alfalfa sprouts, much
more than enough to feed on.</small><br>

<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>Rent
becomes critically important in Georgist economics,
because rent is the increment of market gain that accrues to choice
land parcels. This insight arose originally in the context of
agricultural societies, where differential qualities of land were
recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone to
keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the
efforts of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a
higher yield separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment
might represent, this constituted a windfall gain above and beyond what
might be minimally expected. This is land rent, and it exists even if
it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as earlier noted, the greatest land rents
derive from their location, grown out of nearby social investment.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The concept of rent needs further explication precisely because
it is
so foreign to 20th century students, even those who have been schooled
in economics at it is currently taught. Land rent has no relationship
to the word rent as it is used in contemporary vernacular, that is,
when one rents a car or an apartment. Rather, rent is a surplus,
defined as the return on investment above and beyond what is minimally
required to bring a service into production. To take just an elementary
example,
consider that there are three parcels of land available for farming and
three farmers of equal ability and enterprise. But suppose the
parcels differ in their productive capacity, due perhaps to their
fertility, access to water, and so on. If planted with similar quality
seed, the three parcels will yield different quantities of harvest, the
one with the highest quality land having the best return.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The one with
the lowest quality land would in like fashion have the&nbsp;lowest
return. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic rent is
defined as the amount of surplus harvest
qualitatively measured by the difference between the parcel with the
highest return and that with the lowest return</span></span>. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>As with all nineteenth century moral philosophers, Henry George
subscribed to a belief in natural law. The natural order of things as
he saw it required that land be held in usufruct and that rent from
such should be returned to society. The theory was inspired by his
deeply religious roots and grounded in his reading of the prominent
thinkers that predated him. The natural order was also a moral order,
and the failure to comply with the order of nature and society as he
saw it was a perversion of justice. The fruits of the land belonged to
everyone, just as the fruits of one&#8217;s own labor were uniquely one&#8217;s
own. Since one owned one&#8217;s body, one was entitled to keep the product
of one&#8217;s physical efforts. Society had no more right to confiscate the
earnings of one&#8217;s sweat and brow than it ought to leave in the hands of
rich landowners the rent that was everyone&#8217;s inherent birthright to be
shared. There were just and unjust
taxes, and the only just tax was that which grew out of rent, of the
unearned increment that visited certain land sites as windfall gains
because of the efforts and investments by the community. Income and
excise taxes were unjust and confiscatory&#8212; even theft, as especially
were tariffs. Taxing or collecting land rent alone was the means of
ending poverty and restoring progress. Indeed many Georgists reject use
of the word tax entirely, preferring instead to talk instead about rent
collection. There is even a lapel button Georgists use that says
&#8220;Abolish all taxes; collect ground rent instead.&#8221; ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The premises of discourse</strong></p>
  <p>What is most called for today is a return to basic analysis. Elementary economics
      starts with the recognition that there are three factors of production in the
      creation of social wealth. Each of those factors are mutually exclusive and,
      taken together, are jointly exhaustive of all sources of market value. The
      first of these is what classical economics from Adam Smith on called land.
      Land meant every aspect of nature to which industry can be applied; it meant
      not just locations of space but air, water, and mineral wealth. Today sunlight,
      radio waves, and even time, on occasion, would be added. The second factor
      of production is labor, referring quite simply to the effort applied by people's
      minds or bodies to land. The third factor is the product of past application
      of land and labor to current production: capital. Each factor in classical
      economics has its price, the product of which is the creation of wealth as
      we commonly understand it. The price of labor is wages; the price of capital
      is interest, and the price of land is rent. Rent, as understood in economics,
      is not payment for the use of property owned by others; it has, rather, a more
      technical meaning, one which will require greater explication below.</p>
  <p>We have largely lost sight of these basic premises of economic thought,
    and it has led to our general inability to address the urban challenge of
    taxation
      with a perspective that offers an easy solution. Returning to these fundamental
      building blocks makes things much simpler and more comprehensible. Labor
    continues to be easily understood; its meaning has not changed in the course
    of a shift
      from classical to neoclassical economic thought. But capital, which had
    earlier encompassed only those creations that were the result of human enterprise&#8212; the
      product of labor and land, has now been redefined to include land. Land
    by itself in contemporary neoclassical economics has dropped out of the equation
      altogether, and so for the most part has the concept of economic rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>Mathematical
      formulas in neoclassical economics are entirely changed.</p>
  <p>There is good reason, however, to recover the use of the terms land and
    rent as they were employed in 19th century classical economics: rent is the
    surplus
      produced by the collective enterprise that can provide the necessary revenue
      to easily support public services, if it were only collected in the form
    of taxes.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5]</em></strong></font> In fact, by
    shifting taxes off labor and capital and onto land rent, the performance
    of markets
      would be made fully efficient and would be essentially painless to taxpayers.
      This is the thesis I am arguing here, and which is now possible to demonstrate
      with the advent of computer power and available data. It amplifies and
    validates what has been for a century only a plausible theoretical claim.
    We can now
      show that collecting economic rent can provide for all the services demanded
      of cities and avail themselves of the proper tax base that exceeds all
    others.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> And
      unlike other taxes there is no downside impact; in fact it's positive.
    Economic rent is the surplus created by the community, and it circulates
    through the
      markets until it ultimately comes to settle on land sites<font size="-1"><strong><em>.[7] </em></strong></font>The
      result of its accretion to land sites is to raise their market price. Economic
      rent is sometimes called land rent or ground rent for this reason, and
      comes about not through any titleholder's individual enterprise but by
      the consequence
      rather of society's collective effort. British political economist David
      Ricardo first conceived of land rent in terms of its relationship to agricultural
      production
      in the early 1800s, but its applicability today is understood far more
      easily with regard to the site values in cities. Whereas ground rent to
      Ricardo reflected
      the differential gifts of nature inherent in various land sites, it is
      today better understood as reflective of locational differentials in the
      capacities
      of communities. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Land Rent</strong></p>
  <p> From the standpoint of an economic geographer and for some land economists,
      land rent is simply capitalized transportation cost. Land rent is the surplus
      generated by social activity on or in the vicinity of locational sites that
      accrues to titleholders of those parcels. Whether or not it is recaptured by
      public policy, rent is a natural factor deriving from the intensive use of
      natural capital. One must return to nineteenth-century classical economics
      to appreciate the importance of economic rent or land rent; neoclassical economic
      frameworks have largely discarded it.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font> More
      intensive use of high-value land sites leads to site configurations that
      are less dependent on transportation services. Land rent is highest where
      the greatest
      traffic and market exchanges occur, that being at the center of large conurbations.
      Comparing land values of urban property parcels, the highest land rent
      in the urban cores and traffic junctures are analogous to the contours
      of land elevations.
      Mountain peaks gradually slope down to valleys and flatland regions and
      continue outward until at distant points &#8212; perhaps at the poles of the earth &#8212; land
      sites have no market value at all.</p>
  <p>The differentials in land values are profound, even more than most people
      realize. In 1995, in the small city of Ithaca, New York, the highest quintile
      of land had a value of over $56,000 per acre in the downtown center, whereas
      the lowest quintile only a mile away falls to less than $3,000.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Large
      city centers have far higher site prices. Even in Polk County, Iowa (which
      includes Des Moines), in the middle of cornfields where I did a study two years
      ago, the highest urban value land site was $31.3 million per acre, which quickly
      declined to about $20,000 per acre only about a mile away. In the spring of
      1998, one land parcel (the building was to be razed) of less than an acre in
      New York City's Times Square and split in two pieces by Broadway was sold by
      Prudential Life to Disney for roughly $240 million.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15]</em></strong></font> To
      take another instance, a nine-acre tract on the East River in New York City
      occupied by an obsolete power plant was purchased by Mort Zuckerman to build
      high-rise condominiums two years ago. The sale price was in the neighborhood
      of $680 million and would have been higher were it not for some enormous costs
      associated with the demolition of the old structures.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[16]</em></strong></font> It
      should be noted that the overwhelming proportion of land value is in cities;
      relatively speaking, the site values of peripheral lands, typically used for
      agriculture and timber growth, are negligible. Land values are high in urban
      areas because, over time, rent accrues to a site. Each improvement in proximity
      to a property parcel enhances the value of all other parcels. This makes even
      unimproved sites attractive objects for speculation, particularly when land
      sites surrounding it are to be improved by adding either transportation service
      or new structures. One nine-mile stretch of interstate highway in Albany, New
      York, costing $125 million to construct, has yielded $3.8 billion in increased
      land values (constant dollars) within just two miles of its corridor in the
      forty years of its existence.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17]</em></strong></font> This
      is a thirty-fold return in a time span typically used for bond repayment! The
      Washington Metro created increments in land value along much of the 101-mile
      system completed by 1980 that easily exceeded $3.5 billion, compared with the
      $2.7 billion of federal funds invested in Metro up until that time.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[18]</em></strong></font> Any
      major building construction project, private or public, will have a similar
      effect on adjacent land sites. Differentials in land value can have a profound
      effect on decisions made by titleholders, either positively by inducing appropriate
      development in urban cores or negatively by giving monopoly titleholders power
      to hold sites out of use for long-term speculative gain. Such decisions of
      course determine the character of urban configurations and society as well.
      ...</p>
  <p>Just as recovering the costs of transportation service equilibrates costs
      and benefits on one side of the equation, recovering the economic rent accruing
      to land value facilitates efficient space configurations on the other side.
      Figure 10.2, again conceptually, portrays how the collection of various transportation
      user fees as well as the recovery of land rent corrects the economic distortions
      that today result in sprawl development. The shaded area indicates the pricing
      correctives necessary to ensure that neither urban nor rural land sites are
      disadvantaged in travel or location choices that individuals make for either
      residential or commercial purposes.</p>
  <p>As it happens, collecting land rent is a relatively simple operation: It involves
      a small computer adjustment in the assessment base of what is now the local
      real property tax. The real property tax to an economist is really two separate
      taxes: that put on land value and that put on improvement values. A gradual
      phaseout of the tax on the improvement component, shifting totally to a tax
      on the land, recovers economic rent in a way that satisfies all the principles
      of sound tax theory.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[35]</em></strong></font> It
      is efficient, neutral, equitable, administrate, stable, and simple. It is also
      absolutely foolproof: One cannot hide land or take it to a remote tax haven.
      It relieves poor households (who typically own no land) of any tax burden and
      rewards those titleholders who use their sites efficiently. High-value sites
      are induced to construct high-value improvements, and low-value sites are left
      alone. In this way, central locations, where commercial enterprises typically
      locate, pay according to their intensity; home owners, who typically locate
      at the periphery of a neighborhood community, pay moderately; and agricultural
      land and forestlands pay little if anything. By an automatic and natural process,
      the centrifugal forces of sprawl development are reversed, and investment is
      encouraged in core locales. The higher density resulting affords the necessary
      ten to twelve households per acre (or the commercial equivalent) that makes
      public transportation service economically viable, lessening the prospect of
      automobile dependency.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[36]</em></strong></font> ... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As recently as a century ago
classical economic thought still regarded land for the most part as the
common heritage of mankind. From Adam Smith, through Thomas Malthus,
David Ricardo, and finally with John Stuart Mill economic productivity
was regarded as a function of three interacting factors: land, labor,
and capital. John Locke also accepted these premises. To achieve
optimal economic productivity, one had to exact the appropriate price
from each of those factors. The price of labor was in wages; the price
of capital was interest; and the price of land, particularly following
the thinking of David Ricardo, was rent. <span

for the use of something in fixed supply, or, more generally, payments
above the costs incurred for its creation. </span>Disequilibriums and
inefficiencies in economic development resulted if the appropriate
prices were not paid for each factor. But, as we shall see, there were
powerful interests in this country, bent on not seeing any rent
extracted from land use, that persuaded the nascent economics
profession at the end of the 19th century no longer to regard land as a
separate factor and to redefine the terms of production instead in
two-factor theory. This was concurrent with the inclusion of land as
property, since called "real property."</small><small>... <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span

rent.</b> Everybody talks that way. Canadian economists even when
they come to the States talk that way. Just as though rent were a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The formula says that the greater
the capacity to raise taxes that
a province enjoys, the less will be its equalization payment. And
various potential tax bases are included in this formula. And one of
those is the property tax. But then you look at the fine print and
only the improvements are included.<b><i> The land is specifically
excluded.</i></b> Very pecular. In the formula as it's commonly
printed you don't see that exclusion; it's only in the footnote. But
in the footnote it says 'Instead of the value of land we will
substitute the gross provincial product.' Of course, all right
thinking people know that land value is in direct proportion to the
growth of the provincial product. Or do they? I always thought that
was the product of other inputs. <b><i>What it means is that if a
province has a great deal of valuable land which is not being used to
a highest and best use, that valuable land will not be included in
its potential tax base, and it can continue to get subventions from
the federal government.</i></b> Whereas on the other hand if its
potential tax base includes oil and gas, then the revenues that it
receives from that, or the ability it has to receive revenues from
that, is counted against it in the sharing formula. So this is a very
peculiar sort of rent sharing. Some rents are shared and others are
not. You might even call it a conspiracy against Alberta. I'm sure
that's the way they look at it.... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_CSRS.html"><span

    Land Speculation</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>III. Effects of
    Land Taxes on Speculation</b></p>
  <p><b>A. Taxes on the Rental Value
        of Land</b></p>
  <p>The rental value of land is sometimes defined as the net return from possessing
      land, after paying the costs of other factors. Such a definition suffices if
      land has unchanging opportunities. However, when the use to which land can
      best be put varies with the time when the use begins, such a definition leads
      to ambiguity regarding the rent of land at any specified time. This ambiguity
      can be resolved by defining the rent of a site as the opportunity cost of leaving
      it unused. That is, the rent of a site for the span of time from a to b is
      the present value of net returns from use of the site beginning at a, minus
      the present value, discounted to time a, from use of the site beginning at
      time b (Tideman, 1990). Another way of expressing this is that the rental value
      of a site for the year beginning now is the amount of money that a person would
      be willing to pay for the use of the site for one year beginning now, if use
      carried with it an option to use the site into the indefinite future, upon
      payment of future rent, which would be defined in the same way. To implement
      such a recursive definition of rent, there would need to be similar recurring
      transactions involving similar land, so that amounts due in the future could
      be specified.</p>
  <p>The initial effect on the sale value of land of a tax on the rental value
      of land (disregarding general equilibrium effects and the value of any services
      financed by the tax), is to reduce the value of all land by the same percentage
      as the tax rate. That is, the tax is capitalized into the purchase price of
      land. It is borne by those who hold land at the time the tax is announced.
      Feldstein (1977) has shown that in a closed economy, a tax on rent can generate
      income effects that produce a new equilibrium with higher saving and lower
      interest rates, which have an upward effect on land prices, thereby shifting
      at least part of the tax. These effects do not arise in a small open economy,
      as when a single urban area taxes land. Furthermore, if the proceeds of the
      tax are used to finance public services that add to the value of land, it is
      possible for those who hold land to be better off with the combination of taxes
      and public expenditures than they would be with neither. In any case, income
      effects do not constitute economic distortions. A tax on the rental value of
      land has no distorting effects as long as it is assessed in such a way that
      there is no action that possessors of land can take that will increase or decrease
      their taxes.</p>
  <p>The effect on land speculation of a tax on the rental value of land is to
      reduce the return from being the one who possesses land when its improved prospects
      become known. Less effort will be spent in seeking to discover what land will
      rise in value and in seeking to acquire land in advance of when the rise in
      value becomes generally known. Because the winner's curse will be less prominent,
      less land will be withheld from development. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">Market-Based Systems
    for Assigning Rental Value to Land</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Selling land-use rights for annual rent allows each year's population to claim
      that year's rent. While the proceeds of sales can be invested for the benefit
      of future generations, not collecting the money in advance helps preserve the
      heritage of the future against political predations. For all of these reasons,
      I assume that what is desired is not a purchase price but a rental price to
      be assigned to
    each site for each year. ...</p>
  <p>The idea of renting sites one year at a time may sound unpromising at first.
      The efficient use of land generally requires improvements that last for many
      years. How can entrepreneurs be expected to improve land if they are only permitted
      to rent it for one year at a time? The answer is that entrepreneurs can be
      expected to make durable improvements to land even under these circumstances,
      provided that they have the opportunity to continue to use the land they have
      improved, for a price that is determined in a fair and impartial
    manner. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p>Commons Rent</p>
  <p>It shouldn&#8217;t be thought that the commons is, or ought to be, a money-free
    zone. In fact, an important subject for economists (and the rest of us) to
    understand is commons rent.</p>
  <p>By this I don&#8217;t mean the monthly check you send to a landlord. In
    economics, rent has a more precise meaning: it&#8217;s money paid because
    of scarcity. If you&#8217;re not an economist, that may sound puzzling, but
    consider this. A city has available a million apartments. In absolute terms,
    that means apartments aren&#8217;t scarce. But the city is confined geographically
    and demand for apartments is intense. In this economic sense, apartments
    are scarce. Now think back to that check you pay your landlord, or the mortgage
    you pay the bank. Part of it represents the landlord&#8217;s operating costs
    or the bank&#8217;s cost of money, but part of it is pure rent &#8212; that
    is, money paid for scarcity. That&#8217;s why New Yorkers and San Franciscans
    write such large checks to landlords and banks, while people in Nebraska
    don&#8217;t.</p>
  <p>Rent rises when an increase in demand bumps into a limit in supply. Rent
    due to such bumping isn&#8217;t good or bad; it just is.We can (and should)
    debate the distribution of that rent, but the rent itself arises automatically.
    And it&#8217;s important that it does so, because this helps the larger economy
    allocate scarce resources efficiently. Other methods of allocation are possible.
    We can distribute scarce things on a first come, first served basis, or by
    lottery, political power, seniority, or race. Experience has shown, though,
    that selling scarce resources in open markets is usually the best approach,
    and such selling inevitably creates rent.</p>
  <p>Rent was of great interest to the early economists &#8212; Adam Smith, David
    Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill, among others &#8212; because it constituted
    most of the money earned by landowners, and land was then a major cost of
    production. The supply of land, these economists noted, is limited, but demand
    for it steadily increases. So, therefore, does its rent. Thus, landowners
    benefit from what Mill called the unearned increment &#8212; the rise in
    land value attributable not to any effort of the owner, but purely to a socially
    created increase in demand bumping into a limited supply of good land.</p>
  <p>The underappreciated American economist Henry George went further. Seeing
    both the riches and the miseries of the Gilded Age, he asked a logical question:
    Why does poverty persist despite economic growth? The answer, he believed,
    was the appropriation of rent by landowners. Even as the economy grew, the
    property rights system and the scarcity of land diverted almost all the gains
    to a landowning minority. Whereas competition limited the gains of working
    people, nothing kept down the landowners&#8217; gains. As Mill had noted,
    the value of their land just kept rising. To fix the problem, George advocated
    a steep tax on land and the abolition of other taxes. His bestselling book
    Progress and Poverty catapulted him to fame in the 1880s, but mainstream
    economists never took him seriously.</p>
  <p>By the twentieth century, economists had largely lost interest in rent;
    it seemed a trivial factor in wealth production compared to capital and labor.
    But the twenty-first century ecological crisis brings rent back to center-stage.
    Now it&#8217;s not just land that&#8217;s scarce, but clean water, undisturbed
    habitat, biological diversity, waste absorption capacity, and entire ecosystems.</p>
  <p>This brings us back to common property rights. The definition and allocation
    of property rights are the primary factors in determining who pays whom for
    what. If, in the case of pollution rights, pollution rights are given free
    to past polluters, the rent from the polluted ecosystem will also go to them.
    That&#8217;s because prices for pollution-laden products will rise as pollution
    is limited (remember, if demand is constant, a reduction in supply causes
    prices to go up), and those higher prices will flow to producers (which is
    to say, polluters).</p>
  <p>By contrast, if pollution rights are assigned to trusts representing pollutees
    and future generations, and if these trusts then sell these rights to polluters,
    the trusts rather than the polluters will capture the commons rent. If the
    trusts split this money between per capita dividends and expenditures on
    public goods, everyone benefits.</p>
  <p>At this moment, based on pollution rights allocated so far, polluting corporations
    are getting most of the commons rent. But the case for trusts getting the
    rent in the future is compelling. If this is done, consumers will pay commons
    rent not to corporations or government, but to themselves as beneficiaries
    of commons trusts. Each citizen&#8217;s dividend will be the same, but his
    payments will depend on his purchases of pollution-laden products. The more
    he pollutes, the more rent he&#8217;ll pay. High polluters will get back
    less than they put in, while low polluters will get back more. The microeconomic
    incentives, in other words, will be perfect. (See figure 6.1.)</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s equally significant, though less obvious, is that the macroeconomic
    incentives will be perfect too. That is, it will be in everyone&#8217;s interest
    to reduce the total level of pollution. Remember how rent for scarce things
    works: the lower the supply, the higher the rent. Now, imagine you&#8217;re
    a trustee of an ecosystem, and leaving aside (for the sake of argument) your
    responsibility to preserve the asset for future generations, you want to
    increase dividends. Do you raise the number of pollution permits you sell,
    or lower it? The correct, if counterintuitive answer is: you lower the number
    of permits. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem as I see it is the mixing of two separate dimensions of economic
    value &#8211; what are frequently referred to as stock and flow. Stock value
    is a variable that has no time dimension, e.g., the stock of capital, or
    what in real estate is typically understood as the market price of a parcel.19
    Flow, by contrast, is the quantity of an economic variable measured over
    a period of time. So the flow of an investment may be measured as the amount
    of investment expenditure or the amount of income return in a given time,
    such as in a yearly period.20 We can easily understand stock when looking
    at the value of a house or an office building just as we can for a car or
    a computer, as it represents the investment of labor and capital, and can
    be priced based on market supply and demand, depreciation, and replacement
    value much as with any other manufactured good.</p>
  <p>The other component of a real property parcel is the land value, which reflects
    a market price based on very different criteria. Despite the apparent reality
    that land is visible and tangible, land prices reflect the value of location
    more than they do the material content they contain. This is easy to understand
    when one reflects that if some earth is removed from a site and brought to
    another place, the prices of each site is largely unaffected.21 Location
    value has duration, and the value of this flow of rights for exclusive use
    of a site requires a flow price rather than a stock price. <strong>This flow
    is really what classical economists refer to as ground rent or economic rent.22
    Also
    known as &#8220;land rent,&#8221; it is defined as &#8220;a payment to a
    factor beyond what is needed to put that factor into use; [it is a price
    for use] beyond what is needed to maintain a market for land.&#8221;23 Land
    has a selling price because we have come to regard land sites as objects,
    as commodities to be traded,24 and they are understood to have a static price,
    as a stock rather than as a flow. That stock price really needs to be understood
    instead as the &#8220;present value&#8221; of the flow of ground rent minus
    taxes.</strong> &#8220;Present value&#8221; is an economic term that refers to &#8220;the
    worth of a future stream of returns or costs in terms of their value now.&#8221;25
    Consideration in this way brings to the fore other concerns and factors.
