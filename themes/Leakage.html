    <div align="left">
      <p>Much of the land rent in the typical municipality's central
            business district leaves town. The landholders are not local residents who
            might spend their &quot;take&quot; in local stores. Rather, they are family trusts,
            corporations, real estate investment trusts and other corporate entities. </p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>What are we to do about that? Think outside the income
        tax box! Stop taxing wages. Stop taxing profits. Stop taxing buildings.
        Just
            tax the land values on the sites in the central business district.
        Keep that money in town, recirculating to fund next year's common spending,
        on schools,
            streets, emergency services. Why tax the tenants, whether they are
        the folks who rent their homes from someone else or those who own retail,
        professional,
            manufacturing or other businesses? It seems very odd that first we
        ask tenants to pay their landlords, and then we ask them, as wage-earners,
        to pay a
            portion of their wages, and/or a tax on their purchases, to fund the
        very services
            that
            make the site they work on valuable. Even more perverse is to tax the
        commuters who live elsewhere to pay for a portion of the services that
        cause their
            employers to pay higher rents.</p>
      <p>Our landlords make out very well, while the rent-payers end up paying
        twice. No wonder they're poor.</p>
      <p>And we haven't yet talked about people who <em>buy</em> their own homes.
        They pay the previous owner -- who didn't do anything particular to create
        the <em>land</em> value -- for the right to occupy the house and land.
        The previous owner leaves town with tens or hundreds of thousands of
        dollars' worth of appreciation -- land appreciation, since houses, bring
        manmade, are depreciating, just like cars and TVs -- and our young people
        must stretch to afford a home within a reasonable distance
        of
        their work. They pay large percentages of their salaries -- and both
        husbands and wives work in most couples -- to the mortgage lender, and
        then they pay again in the form of income and sales taxes. The lucky
        town-departer, though, leaves having been paid for occupying his house,
        or more precisely, his land, for all those years. He leaves with land
        rent too, just as the individual and corporate landlords do.</p>
      <p>Is this any way to run a society??? Georgists don't think so. We
        think we have a much better idea. Tax the land <em><strong>value.</strong> </em>Bring
        the <em><strong>price</strong></em> of land down to affordability. Don't
        reward people for holding land; ask them to pay the community, in the
        form of taxes
        pegged to the land's value, for the use of that site. Simple? Yes. Easy
        to implement? Yup! <em><strong>Just</strong></em>? Yep! Different from
        what we do now? Yes, just as the end of slavery was different from the
        period in which some Americans
        enslaved other Americans. Will it lead to a freer society, a more equal
        distribution of wealth, income, leisure and opportunity? We are persuaded
        that it will.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Every community, whatever its
      political name and extent &#8212; village,
            city, state or province or nation &#8212; has its own normal, unfailing
            income, growing with the growth of the community and always adequate
            to meet necessary governmental expenditure.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">  To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the
            land on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties
            and advantages of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this
            land in its natural state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted
            and unoccupied, including its waters, its contents and its location,
            every individual in the community (which may consist of any political
            unit selected) has an equal right, while all the individuals together
            have a joint right to the value for use which society has conferred
    upon these natural advantages.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not
            particularly descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic
            Rent.&quot;</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any
            piece of ground is the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for
            the exclusive use
            of that ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements
            thereon. <strong>Every holder or user of land pays economic rent, but
            he now pays most of it to the wrong party.</strong> The aggregate economic
            rent of the territory occupied by any political unit is, as has been
            stated above,
            always sufficient, usually more than sufficient, for the legitimate expenses
            of the government of that unit.<strong> As also stated above, the economic
            rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners. ... </strong></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">An illustration has already been given of the case of a
            piece of farm land. Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take
            a corner lot centrally located in New York City, the title to which lot
            is held by, say, Mr. John William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of
            an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom. It did not cost the present owner
            anything, nor his father nor his grandfather. There is a little old building
            on it, which has always been rented at a figure ten times as large as
            the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely subsidized each
            year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's growth
            in which the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
            in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to,
            say, two hundred times its early value.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and
            can't be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure
            of population is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public
            money to the benefit of this land must continue, he will not sell it.
            So he gives a twenty-one year lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a
            year net, with a privilege to the lessee of renewals at advancing figures.
            The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Now what is this net $20,000
      a year, which will be regularly remitted to Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe
      or wherever he may be, given in payment
            for? Not for the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does
            is to pull it down. Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock,
            which has got to be blasted out as part of its improvement.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community,
            and the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the
            present $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command
            in later years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs
            to the community and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">That the latter has no good right
      to it is at once evident when we remember that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody else has
            got to give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000 that some
            men and women have got to work to earn every year to hand over to
            a man who
            does not render, and does not feel any obligation to render, one
            dollar's worth of public or private service in return. Such is the
            wild travesty
            of justice which we call law. It is not comical only because it is
            frankly tragic in its social results.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Now suppose this $20,000 and
      all the rest of this same community product &#8212; i.e.,
            the site or location rent of its ground &#8212; were paid every year
            to its rightful owner, the treasurer of New York City, what would
            become of taxation, with its inseparable retinue, Fraud, Evasion,
            Perjury,
            Inequality, and an all-pervading public sense of injustice? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Now imagine for a moment the effect upon the appearance
            of a city and upon the comfort of its population which would result from
            the change of fiscal policy which this article proposes. At present,
            a tempting premium is placed upon keeping land unimproved or inadequately
            improved, while a heavy penalty is imposed upon improvement. Most land
            appreciates constantly. All buildings depreciate from the moment of completion.
            Yet the building is taxed equally with the land.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">What incentive does such a system offer the speculative landowner to
            put up a commodious, well-lighted modern structure in place of the old
            ruin which now pays him so well? The old one cannot depreciate much more,
            and while paying a trifling tax because of its physical worthlessness,
            he is thereby enabled to collect and pocket the economic rent of the
            ground, which the community is continually rendering more valuable. The
            new building would absorb a large amount of capital, would begin to run
            down even before it could be occupied, and would be taxed to the limit.
            Why then is not the landlord justified in letting well enough alone,
            enjoying the growing economic rent, and waiting till he can get a fancy
            price for the right to collect it?</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">But reverse the conditions. Reclaim for the community its natural income,
            making it expensive either to keep needed land vacant or to withhold
            it from the ready and willing to improve it to the full extent of its
            possibilities.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Does it require severe intellectual effort to foresee the results? Better
            and better houses, apartments, tenements, offices and stores, more employment
            for labor in all enterprises now held back by the shadow of the tax-gatherer,
            an end of all tax-lying, tax-evasion and tax-injustice, and withal, a
            public revenue adequate to all real public needs.</p>

                of land taxation is its interesting positive effect on the economic
                base of a city. It strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee
                owners harder than resident owners.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The
                land fraction in real estate is generally highest in the CBD of
                any city, so that is a favorite place for absentees to buy and
                hold. They like the steady income, and the "trophy" quality. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
                surplus in real estate is what attracts outside buyers, and land
                is what yields the surplus.</span></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>About 2/3 of downtown Los Angeles is owned
                by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more workaday city, Milwaukee,

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your
              balance of payments. When you get more tax money from absentees,
              money that used to flow to Tehran, Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows
              into your local treasury to pay your local teachers and city workers,
              and relieve your builders and building managers. In this way taxing

energy, they deprive others in the
community of income. Yet, the loss pales when compared to paying
mortgages and [income] taxes. A recent
study of Oakland, CA found torrents of dollars pumped out of town
headed for the treasuries of distant capitols and the bank vaults of
distant lenders.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While mortgages and interest
elevate an elite elsewhere, they keep
debtors on a treadmill at home. To those anxious over every next
payment, how appealing is an economy no longer expanding its girth?
In addition, what&#8217;s their debt for? Credit? The total savings of
all members of a community should suffice. Local bank "used to" be
the norm.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other major drain, taxes, at
about 40% of the average
worker&#8217;s income, usually total more than the value of government
services received. And who receives them? Corporate loggers, miners,
factory farms, and tractor trailers. Lose such subsidies, leveling
the playing field, and local recyclers, family farmers, and freight
haulers could compete. Their success would plug the visible leaks -
imported food, energy, and materials....&nbsp; <a
