        <p>In many towns and cities, some of the best sites
            in the downtown are owned not by residents of the town, who might
          spend some of their rent receipts in local stores or restaurants, but
          by out of town
            individuals, family trusts, real estate trusts, pension funds, individual
            retirees, American corporations and their shareholders, individual
          foreigners, foreign corporations and their shareholders. The rent that
          individual tenants and small businesses and other commercial tenants
          pay is siphoned off to these landholders, instead of being recycled
          to meet the needs of the local community.</p>
        <p>What would life be like in <em>your</em> town if the portion of the rent money
          that local tenants paid to their landlords <em>for locations</em> (that
          is, not for the building, but for its location) was kept by the town
          and used to support the schools, pave the highways, fund emergency
          services
          and
          libraries and social services? What would life be like in <strong>your</strong> home
          town if, when someone died or left town, instead of them leaving with
          (or
          leaving to their heirs) the value of their land, that land value was
          recycled back into local projects?</p>
        <p>We could stop taxing buildings. We could stop taxing sales. We could
          stop local wage taxes, which afflict cities like Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>And if we collected the land rent from owners of property, our children

            </a>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The best measure of rent is, of
            course, its proportion to the
            produce. The only estimate of Irish rent as a proportion of which I
            know is that of Buckle, who puts it at one-fourth of the produce. In
            this country I am inclined to think one-fourth would generally be
            considered a moderate rent. Even in California there is considerable
            land rented for one-third the crop, and some that rents for one-half
            the crop; while, according to a writer in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span>, the
            common rent in that great wheat-growing section of the New Northwest
            now being opened up is one-half the crop! ...</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>... In New York, in San Francisco, in
            Washington, Boston, Chicago, and St. Louis, live men who own large
            tracts of land which they seldom or never see. A resident of
            Rochester is said to own no less than four hundred farms in different
            States, one of which (I believe in Kentucky) comprises thirty-five
            thousand acres. Under the plantation system of farming and that of
            stock-raising on a grand scale, which are developing so rapidly in
            our new States, very much of the profits go to professional men and
            capitalists who live in distant cities. Corporations whose stock is
            held in the East or in Europe own much greater bodies of land, at
            much greater distances, than do the London corporations possessing
            landed estates in Ireland. To say nothing of the great land-grant
            railroad companies, the Standard Oil Company probably owns more acres
            of Western land than all the London companies put together own of
            Irish land. And, although landlordism in its grosser forms is only
            beginning in the United States, there is probably no American,
            wherever he may live, who cannot in his immediate vicinity see some
            instance of absentee landlordism. The tendency to concentration born
            of the new era ushered in by the application of steam shows itself in
            this way as in many others. To those who can live where they please,
            the great cities are becoming more and more attractive.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>And it is further to be remarked that too much stress is laid
            upon
            absenteeism, and that it might be prevented without much of the evil
            often attributed to it being cured. That is to say, that to his
            tenantry and neighborhood the owner of land in Galway or Kilkenny
            would be as much an absentee if he lived in Dublin as if he lived in
            London, and that, if Irish landlords were compelled to live in
            Ireland, all that the Irish people would gain would be,
            metaphorically speaking, the crumbs that fell from the landlords'
            tables. For if the butter and eggs, the pigs and the poultry, of the
            Irish peasant must be taken from him and exported to pay for his
            landlord's wine and cigars, what difference does it make to him where
            the wine is drunk or the cigars are smoked? ... <span

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
            Is it not a self-evident truth, as Thomas Jefferson said, that "the
            land belongs in usufruct to the living," and that they who have died
            have left it, and have no power to say how it shall be disposed of?
            Title to land! Where can a man get any title which makes the earth his
            property? There is a sacred right to property &#8212; sacred because ordained
            by the laws of nature, that is to say, by the laws of God, and
            necessary to social order and civilisation. That is the right of
            property in things produced by labour; it rests on the right of a man
            to himself. That which a man produces, that is his against all the
            world, to give or to keep, to lend, to sell or to bequeath; but how can
            he get such a right to land when it was here before he came? Individual
            claims to land rest only on appropriation. I read in a recent number of
            the "Nineteenth Century," possibly some of you may have read it, an
            article by an ex-prime minister of Australia in which there was a
            little story that attracted my attention. It was of a man named
            Galahard, who in the early days got up to the top of a high hill in one
            of the finest parts of western Australia. He got up there, looked all
            around, and made this proclamation: "All the land that is in my sight
            from the top of this hill I claim for myself; and all the land that is
            out of sight I claim for my son John."</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>That story is of universal application. Land titles everywhere
            come from just such appropriations. Now, under certain circumstances,
            appropriation can give a right. You invite a company of gentlemen to
            dinner and you say to them: "Be seated, gentlemen," and I get into this
            chair. Well, that seat for the time being is mine by the right of
            appropriation. It would be very ungentlemanly, it would be very wrong
            for any one of the other guests to come up and say: "Get out of that
            chair; I want to sit there!" <span style="font-weight: bold;">But that
            right of possession, which is good so far as the chair is concerned,
            for the time, does not give me a right to appropriate all there is on
            the table before me. Grant that a man has a right to appropriate such
            natural elements as he can use, has he any right to appropriate more
            than he can use?</span> Has a guest in such a case as I have supposed a
            right to appropriate more than he needs and make other people stand up?
            That is what is done.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why, look all over this country
&#8212; look at this town or any other town. If men only took what they
            wanted to use we should all have enough; but they take what they do not
            want to use at all. Here are a lot of Englishmen coming over here and
            getting titles to our land in vast tracts; what do they want with our
            land?</span> They do not want it at all; it is not the land they want;
            they have no use for American land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What
            they want is the income that they know they can in a little while get
            from it. </span>Where does that income come from? <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It comes from
            labour, from the labour of American citizens. What we are selling to
            these people is our children, not land.</span> ... <a

            Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
            (1887 speech)<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We are selling land now in large
            quantities to certain English lords, who are coming over here and
            buying greater estates than the greatest in Great Britain or Ireland.
            We are selling them land; they are buying land. Did it ever occur to
            you that they do not want that land? They have no use whatever for
            American land; they do not propose to come over here and live on it.
            They cannot carry it over there to where they do live.</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>It is not the land that they want. What they want is the income
            from it. They are buying it not because they themselves want to use it,
            but because by and by, as population increases, numbers of American
            citizens will want to use it, and then they can say to these American
            citizens: "You can use this land provided you pay us one-half of all
            you make upon it." <span style="font-weight: bold;">What we are
            selling those foreign lords is not really land; we are selling them the
            labor of American citizens; we are selling them the privilege of
            taking, without any return for it, the proceeds of the toil of our
            children.</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            <small>So, here in New York, you will read in the papers every day that
            the price of land is going up. John Jones or Robert Brown has made a
            hundred thousand dollars within a year in the increase in the value of
            land in New York. What does that mean? It means he has the power of
            getting many more coats, many more cigars, dry goods, horses and
            carriages, houses or much more food and wine. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">He has gained the power of taking for his
            own a great number of these products of human labor.</span></small><br>
            <br>
            <small>But what has he done? He has not done anything. He may have been
            off in Europe or out west, or he may have been sitting at home taking
            it easy. If he has done nothing to get this increased income, where
            does it come from? The things I speak of are all products of human
            labor &#8212; someone has to work for them. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When
            a man who does no work can get them, necessarily the people who do work
            to produce them must have less of the products of human labor than they
            ought to have.&nbsp; </span>...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">

          and the free peasantry

                the things that work produces, but doing none of it himself.
          The people who did the work were living in negro huts, on coarse food;

              himself on the fruits of their labor. (Hear, hear) He had no legal right
              to make them work for him. Oh! no. If they ran away he could not put

ROBINSON CRUSOE, as we all know, took Friday as his slave. Suppose, however,
that instead of taking Friday as his slave, Robinson Crusoe had welcomed him
as a man and a brother; had read him a Declaration of Independence, an Emancipation
Proclamation and a Fifteenth Amendment, and informed him that he was a free and
independent citizen, entitled to vote and hold office; but had at the same time
also informed him that that particular island was his (Robinson Crusoe's) private
and exclusive property. What would have been the difference? Since Friday could
not fly up into the air nor swim off through the sea, since if he lived at all
he must live on the island, he would have been in one case as much a slave as
in the other. Crusoe's ownership of the island would be equivalent of his ownership

THEY no longer have to drive their slaves to work; want and the fear of want
do that more effectually than the lash. They no longer have the trouble of looking
out for their employment or hiring out their labor, or the expense of keeping
them when they cannot work. That is thrown upon the slaves. The tribute that
they still wring from labor seems like voluntary payment. In fact, they take
it as their honest share of the rewards of production &#8212; since they furnish
the land! And they find so-called political economists, to say nothing of so-called
preachers of Christianity, to tell them so. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

IF the two young Englishmen I have spoken of had come over here and bought so
many American citizens, they could not have got from them so much of the produce
of labor as they now get by having bought land which American citizens are glad
to be allowed to till for half the crop. And so, even if our laws permitted,
it would be foolish for an English duke or marquis to come over here and contract
for ten thousand American babies, born or to be born, in the expectation that
when able to work he could get out of them a large return. For by purchasing
or fencing in a million acres of land that cannot run away and do not need to
be fed, clothed or educated, he can, in twenty or thirty years, have ten thousand
full-grown Americans, ready to give him half of all that their labor can produce
on his land for the privilege of supporting themselves and their families out
of the other half. This gives him more of the produce of labor than he could
exact from so many chattel slaves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

OF the two systems of slavery, I think there can be no doubt that upon the same
moral level, that which makes property of persons is more humane than that which
results from making private property of land. The cruelties which are perpetrated
under the system of chattel slavery are more striking and arouse more indignation
because they are the conscious acts of individuals. But for the suffering of
the poor under the more refined system no one in particular seems responsible.
. . . But this very fact permits cruelties that would not be tolerated under
the one system to pass almost unnoticed under the other. Human beings are overworked,
are starved, are robbed of all the light and sweetness of life, are condemned
to ignorance and brutishness, and to the infection of physical and moral disease;
are driven to crime and suicide, not by other individuals, but by iron necessities
for which it seems that no one in particular is responsible. <br>
  <br>
To match from the annals of chattel slavery the horrors that day after day transpire
unnoticed in the heart of Christian civilization, it would be necessary to go
back to ancient slavery, to the chronicles of Spanish conquest in the New World,
or to stories of the Middle passage. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had
          the pleasure of making her acquaintance, because she lives in a lunatic
          asylum, which does
                  not happen to be on my visiting list. This woman has been mentally
                  incompetent from birth. She is well taken care of, because
          her father left her when he died the income of a large farm on the
          outskirts
          of
                  a city. The city has since grown and the land is now worth,
          at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered
          with
          office buildings,
                  and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent by
          the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
          health, so
                  she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
              this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million
              dollars. And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation,
              which would he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the
              society which compels thousands of people to wear themselves to death
              in order to pay her the income of twenty million dollars?</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes
          it easy to see that she is not entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she
                owns. But how about all the other people who have bought up and are
                holding for speculation the most desirable land? The value of this
                land increases, not because of anything these owners do &#8212; not
                because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
                purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that
                neighborhood and must have use of the land.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
              because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way.
              But it seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the
              community was going to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself,
              is not in any way useful to the community. The man may have planted
              trees, or built roads, and put in sidewalks and sewers; all that is
              useful work, and for that he should be paid. But should he be paid
              for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences
          of this guessing game. The consequences of land speculation are tenantry
          and debt on the farms,
                and slums and luxury in the cities. A great part of the necessary
          land is held out of use, and so the value of all land continually increases,
                until the poor man can no longer own a home. The value of farm
          land
                also increases; so year by year more independent farmers are
          dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on their mortgages.
          So the land
          becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where wealth
                accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with
                festering slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided
                with enormous
                fortunes, which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot
                intelligently spend. ...</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities,
          are enormously wealthy families, living on hereditary incomes derived
          from crowded slums.
                  Here and there among these rich men is one who realizes that
          he has not earned what he is consuming, and that it has not brought
          him happiness,
                  and is bringing still less to his children. Such men are casting
          about for ways to invest their money without breeding idleness and
          parasitism. Some of them might be grateful to learn about this enclave
          plan,
          and
                  to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what its people
          are doing to make possible a peaceful and joyous life, even in this
          land of bootleggers
                  and jazz orchestras. ... <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read the whole article </a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot
                centrally located in New York City, the title to which lot is held
                by, say, Mr. John William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an
                old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom. It did not cost the present owner
                anything, nor his father nor his grandfather. There is a little old
                building on it, which has always been rented at a figure ten times
                as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
                subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period
                of the city's growth in which the increase in population and the
                expenditure of public money in that neighborhood have raised the
                value of this corner location to, say, two hundred times its early
              value.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live,
                and can't be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that
                the pressure of population is sure to increase and that the expenditure
                of public money to the benefit of this land must continue, he will
                not sell it. So he gives a twenty-one year lease to the corner for,
                say, $20,000 a year net, with a privilege to the lessee of renewals
                at advancing figures. The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which
          will be regularly remitted to Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever
          he may be, given in payment
                  for? Not for the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee
                  does is to pull it down. Not for the land itself &#8212; it
                  is all rock, which has got to be blasted out as part of its
                  improvement.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community,
                and the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words,
                the present $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location
                will command in later years, is strictly a community product, and
                as such belongs to the community and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>That the latter has no good right to it
          is at once evident when we remember that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody
                  else has got to give something for nothing.&quot; Here are
                  $20,000 that some men and women have got to work to earn every
                  year to
                  hand over to a man who does not render, and does not feel any
                  obligation
                  to render, one dollar's worth of public or private service
                  in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice which we call
                  law.
                  It is not
                  comical only because it is frankly tragic in its social results.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Now suppose this $20,000 and all the rest
          of this same community product &#8212; i.e., the site or location rent of its ground &#8212; were
                  paid every year to its rightful owner, the treasurer of New
          York City, what would become of taxation, with its inseparable retinue,
                  Fraud, Evasion, Perjury, Inequality, and an all-pervading public

                to $400,000,000. Assuming the lesser of these figures and adding
                the receipts from licenses, fees and fines, New York City should
                receive, of her own income, enough to pay all her own legitimate
                bills, to make her proper contributions to county and state and build

                          of land taxation is its interesting positive effect on the economic
                          base of a city. It strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee
                          owners harder than resident owners.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The
                          land fraction in real estate is generally highest in the CBD of
                          any city, so that is a favorite place for absentees to buy and
                          hold. They like the steady income, and the "trophy" quality. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
                          surplus in real estate is what attracts outside buyers, and land
                          is what yields the surplus.</span></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>About 2/3 of downtown Los Angeles is owned
                          by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more workaday city, Milwaukee,
                          the absentee owners consist of former residents, or their heirs,
              who grew too rich to abide the harsh winters.</b></small></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your
                        balance of payments. When you get more tax money from absentees,
                        money that used to flow to Tehran, Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows
                        into your local treasury to pay your local teachers and city workers,
                        and relieve your builders and building managers. In this way taxing
            land actually acts to undergird the value of its own base.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

          Several million persons, perhaps half the resident adult population, hold titles
          to land in southern California. With so many holders, the median holding is
          perforce small, although well above the national median. But the mean holding
          is well above the median, indicating a skewed distribution.<br>
            <br>
            All wealth distributions are skewed; so, to a lesser degree, are
            income distributions. Landholding, however, is more skewed than other
            distributions. In 1985 the
          Internal Revenue Service released a Report based on a study of 1983
            estate tax returns. According to the Report, "More than one half of his (the mean
          top wealth-holder's) wealth was held as real estate and corporate stock, with
          real estate surpassing corporate stock as the most prominent asset in the top
          wealth-holder's portfolio." (AP dispatch by Jim Luther, Riverside Press
          Enterprise, 8 March 1985, p. A3.) This Report warrants careful study.<br>
            <br>
            A 19th century California editor turned economist had observed the
            same: "The
          great cause of inequality in the distribution of wealth is inequality in the
          ownership of land ..." (Henry George, <a
 style="font-style: italic;" href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress
          and Poverty</a>,1879). It was a recurring theme: a century before, Thomas Jefferson,
          Tom Paine, Adam Smith and others were of the same opinion. A century later
          Robert <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fellmeth </span>et al. redocumented
          the point for California (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Nader Report: Politics of Land</span>, 1973).
          Between George and Fellmeth, scholars like Walter Goldschmidt, Paul S. Taylor,
          Paul Gates, Adon Poli and many others had documented the same point. Carey
          McWilliams (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Factories in the Field</span>), and novelists like
          Frank Norris (<span style="font-style: italic;">The Octopus</span>) and John
          Steinbeck (<span style="font-style: italic;">The Grapes of Wrath</span>) found
          popular success with the theme.<br>
            <br>
            The Fellmeth-Nader study was too ambitious for its resources, and
            flawed by haste. Critics seized on the flaws to discredit or dismiss
            the substance. Nevertheless
          its main theme, the concentration of landownership, may be tested by
            reference to more conventional sources today. That is our method
            here. ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_WOSC97.html">read

    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... In fact, land use decisions
      are superimposed on a
      settlement pattern based on massive market failure in land.&nbsp; The
      phenomena rather imprecisely called "land speculation" and "absentee
      ownership" betray market failure; and no one disputes there is massive
      regulatory failure in pricing and subsidizing transportation, which in
      turn determine land rents and values.&nbsp; Result: the land market is
      not efficient; land is not properly priced and allocated to begin
      with.&nbsp; This is the thread I will follow, although it may run afoul
      of The Great Secular Superstition.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>This perversion does not occur by accident.&nbsp;
      Spread and sprawl in forestry, cities and agriculture are common
      results of the dominant force driving American politics, the quest for
      unearned increments to land value.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Thorstein Veblen in his final testament, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Absentee
      Ownership</span>, noted that American farmers &nbsp;</small><br style="font-style: italic;">
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">
      ...have always, ... wanted something more than their ... share of
      the soil; not because they were driven by a felt need of doing more
      than their fair share of work ..., but with a view to ... getting
      a little something for nothing in allowing their holdings to be turned
      to account</span> (Veblen, pp. 138-40).&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      <small>To enhance those values they will now invoke
      any complaisant higher power, and since God already did His bit by
      donating the Earth, they turn to Government.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But the profile of land values
      is like a volcanic
      island.&nbsp; To raise the top and the slopes and the shores we must
      also raise the shallows above sea level, where they shed the waters and
      come into use.&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Rising population is one factor pushing up the
      profile of values, but not the strongest one.&nbsp; Increased demand
      per capita is the main factor.&nbsp; These demands include all the
      spurious demands described above, like the demand of government for
      land to "bank" and hold idle, and the demand of speculators "with a
      view to getting a little something for nothing."&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Veblen went on to say that farm technology adapts to
      the Procrustean bed of absentee ownership: rather than leading,
      technology lags changes wrought by the ownership pattern.&nbsp; Thus it
      is not "society" or "efficiency" alone that mandate inorganic
      monocultural chemical farming, but also the peculiar needs of absentee
      owners holding more land than they can work themselves or with their
      families.&nbsp; Logic of, by and for this minority is set up as logic
      for all.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>If this be true, or (more likely) partly true, it
      must be admitted that most academics go along and get along with this
      dominant minority.&nbsp; Organic farming, biological controls,
      appropriate technology, IPM, and other countervailing logics had to
      come from screwballs outside the system, plus a few martyrs and
      kamikazes inside it, dominated as it is by accommodating "regular
      fellows," "good old boys," noncontroversial administrators who
"understand local needs" and "work with community leaders," and
      complaisant faculty who enjoy "credibility."&nbsp; Are we part of the
      problem?&nbsp; Let everyone debate that with his own conscience, and be
      fair enough to lose a few points.&nbsp;&nbsp;<big> </big></small><a

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Where land is valued less for
      amenities, and more for cash crops,
      absentee ownership runs high in much of Iowa and central Illinois,
      with rents going to Chicago lawyers and European investors. Likewise
      the oven-like Imperial and San Joaquin Valleys of California, whose
      absentee owners are more likely to live in coastal California, but
      also have addresses all over the world &#8211; some real, and some in
      tax havens (Gaffney, 1982). </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In such regions, land values per
      capita run high. Vilas County,
      for example, an abandoned old &#8220;cutover&#8221; county centered on
      Eagle River, now has the highest land value per capita in Wisconsin,
      thanks to its many little lakes, and the high social status of
      summering there. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Owner-occupancy and operation.</b>
      There is considerable evidence
      that the result of heavy land-value taxation is to discourage
      absentee owners, and induce sales to residents, and operators. Rural
      Denmark is one case in point. Urban New Westminster, B.C., is another
&#8211; it long boasted the highest rate of resident-ownership in
      Canada, at a time when it was the only city in B.C. exempting
      buildings 100% (and before a boom in apartments, which I suspect
      changed the data). On the east side of the San Joaquin Valley, small
      farms and small businesses are related to resident-ownership and
      owner-operation, both urban and rural. Another Goldschmidt-type study
      or two are needed to establish the relationship definitely, for
      skeptical scholars.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>Few people can invest
      heavily in an asset
      of high price and deferred
      yields.&nbsp; Those who can do so have a field with fewer competitors
      than most, and tend to expand widely.&nbsp; As Loyd Fisher, a rustic
      Nebraska land
      economist twanged to me and others 30 years ago, "When a rancher
      buys these days it ain't the quarters
      roundin' out, it's the sections gobblin' the quarters."<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">29</span></small></small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><font size="-1"><small><small>29.&nbsp; For those
      unfamiliar
      with the American township survey system, as "section" is 640 acres or
      one square mile; a quarter is 160 acres.
    </small></small></font></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      <small>Those with existing cores of rent-yielding land -- &#8220;existing
      nuclei&#8221; --
      enjoy a continual flow of discretionary funds they can use to buy more
      land.&nbsp; The advantage of a head start snowballs over time.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Buying with equity funds is only the beginning.&nbsp; Land is
      the basis
      for extending credit.&nbsp; The "sections" go to the banks for
      accommodation to buy the "quarters."&nbsp; As Rainer Schikele wrote,
"The basis of credit is not marginal productivity, but collateral
      security." A major factor giving one a good credit rating is the prior
      ownership of land.&nbsp; </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Thus, owning land is not just dominated by, but also dominates
      access
      to long-term credit.&nbsp; Here is a positive feedback loop: it takes
      good credit to buy land, and prior ownership of land gives one good
      credit. Those already owning land
      have access to more
      land at a lower carrying cost than those trying to enter the market
      from
      poverty.&nbsp; The result is a tendency for land to agglomerate in the
      hands of the financially strong (cf.&nbsp; B-8).</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Just why some should want to expand so much as to be "alone in
      the
      midst of the earth" has puzzled man gentler souls than Isaiah.&nbsp;
      Thorstein Veblen never turned his acidic irony to better account than
      in
      his last book, <i>Absentee Ownership, </i>describing acquisition for
      acquisition's sake:</small></div>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1955, Spiro Agnew was a
      Maryland State Assemblyman on the
      rise.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> He carried a new law that let
      tax assessors value farmland on its
"use-value" as farmland, instead of market value. It let owners who
      were farming for unearned increments around Baltimore and D.C. hold
      out with low carrying costs.</span> "Farmland" meant land used for
      farming,
      and any play at farming would qualify. Under this law, a relative of
      mine with 102 acres in Maryland near Western Avenue, the D.C. line,
      kept just two steers thereon to validate his farmland assessment
      status. Holding for the rise "never crossed his mind." Right --
      except, whenever such land is condemned for public use, courts
      everywhere have held that compensation must be based on speculative
      market value.<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
      </strong><br>
      <small>It is not just peri-urban land speculators who
      gain. A large
      chunk of land value in rural regions is not based on cash flow from
      food and fiber, but on amenities. Wisconsin is a major playground
      for rich urbanites from nearby Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and
      St. Paul. "Use-value" assessment exempts this chunk of value
      completely, for use-value is based on capitalizing the net cash farm
      income from growing crops, and, in the Wisconsin law, specifically
      corn. The highest land values per capita in the State are in Vilas
      County up in the north woods, once dismissed as worthless "cutovers."
      Vilas' barren podzol soils are worthless for corn, but sparkling
      lakes bedizen the County. Values per capita in Vilas are 6 times
      those in Milwaukee. Rich recreationists and "investors" (read
      speculators) are gobbling up the "wild forties." Shoreline parcels
      are like diamonds among coal. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">100
      years ago, American
      Georgists made a big point that city land
      outvalues rural land many times over. One implication is that
      taxing city land is taxing the rich, and we can ignore farmland. </span>Some
      land-taxers counsel that farmers are easily misled to oppose us,
      so leave them alone and convert the cities. But rich city folks also
      own choice rural lands.

      much too low a rate to make up for a 60-year lifetime of exemption.</span>
      County assessors have to value the land separately on its putative
      value for growing timber, following a State-legislated formula that
      is tailored drastically to understate even that low value (California
      Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Much
      of that land, though, has
      alternative uses, e.g. for retirement and vacation homes and resorts,
      the outliers and pioneers of urban sprawl. There are also mineral
      values, hunting, fishing, rifle ranges, grazing, campsites, tourism,
      rights of way, lumber camps, loading sites, water sources, lakes, log
      storage, landings - there are many things to do with 1/3 of a
      nation's land. <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Those uses are
      all declared "compatible" with timber,
      hence land values derived therefrom are tax-exempt.&nbsp; </span></span></small><small

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It seems to me therefore that we
    need to face up to the question
    that is known in my trade as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiscal
    Federalism, that is, how is money
    going to be distributed by the federal government out of its
    so-called surplus, either to people or the States, or localities? ... </span></small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
    </span></small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
    </span>The reason it's so hard to sell growth policies at the local
    level
    today in the United States is very much due to the fact that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">t</span><b style="font-weight: bold;">he
    United States federal government taxes people and it gives
    subventions</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> to landlords. So the
    landlords can get the
    subventions without having the people. So who needs people?</span>
    That's it
    in a nutshell. We need to reverse that, I think, if we're going to be
    able to make Georgism work at the local level. <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
    
</strong><br>
    <small>
    At any rate, let's begin by looking at the similarities between
    the federal systems in the United States and Canada. In both
    countries we find something called '<b>vertical balancing'</b> which
    means that the senior governments send money to the junior
    governments. We find also something called '<b>horizontal
    balancing</b>' which means that the payments are made more to the
    poorer governments, those that are poorer on a per capita basis, than
    to richer ones.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
    <small>
    </small><br>
    <small>
    <strong>&nbsp;...</strong> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cannan's Law</span>. ...
    But the general idea is, you may
    think you have tenure control of land but if the municipal government
    can tax that land and use that money to finance public welfare
    services, public education and other things that are open to all
    comers, then you will end up with an uneconomical distribution of
    population.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
    <small>
    </small><br>
    <small>
    At the same time, in both countries you find something I will call
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hammer's Law</span>. This is not a
    carpenter's tool but again the name of a
    man, an economist in Missouri, who observed in 1935 that if you
    compared population to land values in the different counties of his
    State (in the very poor counties of the Ozarks the land was hard
    scrabble land of very little value, with the very rich lands in the
    north-western part of the State, which resembles Iowa) you found that
    the population density was much greater on the very poor land of the
    Ozarks than it was on the very rich land of the northwest.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
    <small>
    </small><br>
    <small>
    Now another similarity to the two countries us that the
    subventions that do go from the federal government to the provinces
    in Canada (and you find a similar thing in the United States) do not
    come from the richer provinces. They come instead from the general
    fund, the general taxpayer.<b> There is in other words more vertical
    balancing than there is horizontal balancing (horizontal balancing
    you remember means equalization among the different
    jurisdictions).</b> It's a little like what somebody said about
    foreign aid. 'Foreign aid is a device by which poor people in rich
    countries are taxed to subsidize rich people in poor countries.'</small><br>
    <small>
    </small><br>
    <small>
    We'll see that equalisation in most countries works something like
    that; that is, in addition to this inter-provincial equalisation,
    there's a tax shift involved where local sources of taxation like the
    property tax are being displaced by the federal income tax. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I suppose
    Ferdinand Marcos would be a splendid example of the kind of person I
    was talking about in the poor country and in West Virginia you have
    all these coal companies whose owners live in Palm Beach, whose
    shareholders live in Palm Beach and such places, who benefit from an
    inter-state equalisation that benefits West Virginia. Well these are
    similarities.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
    <small>
    </small><br>
    <small>
    The federal aid in Canada goes to provinces, whereas in the
    United States it goes to specific cities, The U.S. Congressman likes
    to have his fingerprint, as they say, on every dollar that goes from
    Washington. ... So in the
    States the idea has been: <b>Tax the States according to their
    population and then give the money back according to political
    power.</b> In the United States Senate it means that the smallest
    State has just as much clout as the biggest State or would have if
    their senators weren't so merchantable. (I mean, in California when
    we need something we just look to Nevada or one of those places for a
    Senator who is having difficulty raising funds for his next election.
    But that's another story.)<strong> ...</strong></small><small>
    </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the most delightful
    distinction about Canadians is the strong
    and explicit recognition among almost everyone, even if he's an
    economist, who discusses this subject, that different resource
    endowments are the basis of inter-provincial differences.</span>
    <b>Equalisation in Canadian politics means sharing the economic
    rent.</b> Everybody talks that way. Canadian economists even when
    they come to the States talk that way. Just as though rent were a
    permissible word in polite discourse. It's very refreshing. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">However
    there's a very selective attitude towards rent -- towards what rents
    are shareable, I should say.</span> </small></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>Rents from oil and gas are fair game. </small></li>
      <li><small>Forest revenues are fair game. </small></li>
      <li><small>Mineral revenues of other kinds are fair game. </small></li>
      <li><small>Water power is fair game. </small></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But now how about the rents that
    are generated by the valuable
    lands of Montreal, or Toronto, or some of those other big and
    powerful cities in the east?</b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>They are not fair
    game.</i></b> As a matter of fact, if you pore through the fine print
    of the equalization law, which I did on the airplane, you find the
    most interesting exception to what's included in the formula. I'll
    explain the formula to you in a moment if you are still awake. 
    </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The formula says that the greater
    the capacity to raise taxes that
    a province enjoys, the less will be its equalization payment. And
    various potential tax bases are included in this formula. And one of
    those is the property tax. But then you look at the fine print and
    only the improvements are included.<b><i> The land is specifically
    excluded.</i></b> Very pecular. In the formula as it's commonly
    printed you don't see that exclusion; it's only in the footnote. But
    in the footnote it says 'Instead of the value of land we will
    substitute the gross provincial product.' Of course, all right
    thinking people know that land value is in direct proportion to the
    growth of the provincial product. Or do they? I always thought that
    was the product of other inputs. <b><i>What it means is that if a
    province has a great deal of valuable land which is not being used to
    a highest and best use, that valuable land will not be included in
    its potential tax base, and it can continue to get subventions from
    the federal government.</i></b> Whereas on the other hand if its
    potential tax base includes oil and gas, then the revenues that it
    receives from that, or the ability it has to receive revenues from
    that, is counted against it in the sharing formula. So this is a very
    peculiar sort of rent sharing. Some rents are shared and others are
    not. You might even call it a conspiracy against Alberta. I'm sure
    that's the way they look at it. </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>Now another difference is
    the high degree of foreign
    ownership.</i></b> <i>Actually there's no higher degree of absentee
    ownership in Canada than there is in the United States but it is much
    more visible because it's international absentee ownership, whereas
    our absentee owners live in some other corner of the United
    States</i>, at least some of them do, or in Canada -- we have quite a
    few of them. Of course Hong Kong, Belgium, you name it. This high
    degree of absentee ownership, as Bob Williams more than hinted this
    morning, is one of the reasons for the success of the populist
    parties. They recognise property ownership is an alien phenomenon in
    some considerable measure and therefore a legitimate target for
    attack. </small><b><small>Some economists say that the ideal taxpayer
    is a
    non-resident alien. In the case of these foreign owned resources
    you're getting pretty close. ...</small></b></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now let's look at the sharing
    formula. <b>The sharing formula in
    Canada is essentially based on population and potential tax base.</b>
    And it can be made to look very complicated but I think I've boiled
    it down to its essence. <b>You take a province's percentage of the
    population of Canada, and then you take the percentage of the tax
    base that it has, subtract that and that gives you another
    percentage. And then you multiply that times the total tax revenue
    that's collected throughout Canada from that tax source, and then you
    pay them that amount out of the provincial treasury. ... </b></small><small>
    </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The conclusion of all this is that
    the Canadian system is
    really better in terms of its Georgist implications because the
    payments to the provinces, with all the faults that I've described,
    are essentially based on population. Population is in the formula.
    And if you compare this with the way things are done in the States,
    population plays a very minor role in the formula for equalisation
    payments in the United States. </small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, how should it be done?
    Well, there's a well known Georgist
    economist who figured this out a long time ago and wrote an article
    about it. His name is Colin Clark. ... He came up with a plan for
    collecting economic rent at the federal level, and he said what we
    really should do, and this I think is the ultimate equalisation
    payment, is <i>we should classify local jurisdictions according to
    land value per capita, and those that have the least land value per
    capita, we'll leave all of that land value for them to use for local
    purposes. But then we will graduate the federal land tax according to
    the amount of land value per capita in the jurisdiction, and thus we
    will have a federal tax that automatically achieves inter-regional
    equity, without all this razzmatazz that I've been describing about
    inter-regional equalisation payments. </i><a style="font-weight: bold;"

    assigned is whether the taxable
    capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
    cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
    is "yes."</b></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
    local revenue problem today is
    whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
    exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
    California. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He keeps repeating we
    must make a hard choice: cut taxes
    and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
    figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
    one of them.)</span></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
    a property tax based on
    land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
    driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
    certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
    rate,
    not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
    town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
    that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
    think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</b></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There is the answer to
    Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope here
    in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
    answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
    now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
    object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
    toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Non-property
    taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
    activity.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>New
    buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
    it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
    fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
    of their lower property tax rate.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Most California land, on
    the other hand, is now taxed at
    well below the allowable max of 1%</b>. <b>Speculators may sit on it
    at little tax cost, however many highways and water and sewer lines
    run to and past it, however many policemen are guarding it from
    trespass.</b> Little wonder that California enterprise, once so
    dynamic, flexible, and vital, is giving way to stasis and decay. We
    used to lead the nation in making jobs; now in losing them. We used
    to lead in school quality; now in jail population. 
    </small></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When you tax land,
    the market moves each owner to join it with labor and capital as a
    vehicle for enterprise or shelter.</span>    </small></li>
      <li><small>When you untax it, the market
    moves each owner to hold it more passively and obstructively as a
"store of value," like a dog burying a bone. The market not only
    moves the sitting owners, it moves ownership itself to new owners
    whose needs are compatible with the tax system you impose. <strong>... </strong>    </small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Another attractive
    feature of land taxation is its
    interesting positive effect on the economic base of a city. It
    strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder than
    resident owners.</b> The land fraction in real estate is generally
    highest in the CBD of any city, so that is a favorite place for
    absentees to buy and hold. They like the steady income, and the
"trophy" quality. The surplus in real estate is what attracts outside
    buyers, and land is what yields the surplus. <b>About 2/3 of downtown
    Los Angeles is owned by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more
    workaday city, Milwaukee, the absentee owners consist of former
    residents, or their heirs, who grew too rich to abide the harsh
    winters.</b></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your
    balance of payments. When you
    get more tax money from absentees, money that used to flow to Tehran,
    Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows into your local treasury to pay your
    local teachers and city workers, and relieve your builders and
    building managers. In this way taxing land actually acts to undergird
    the value of its own base. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
    Geoism seeks to expose the many forms of unearned wealth, or privilege,
    that exist in our monstrous economic system. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Monopoly rights are the more obvious
    examples of economic privilege, but less noticeable is the massive
    wealth to be gained by using the Global Commons (especially land)
    without reimbursing the rest of us. ... </span></small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Here we&#8217;re going to look
    at one of the most obvious examples of
    unearned wealth &#8211; the massive riches accumulated by the great
    landowners of Britain. Remember, it&#8217;s not the acreage of land that is
    important, but the value of the land.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Britains' wealthiest man gets rich the easy way -- he has his
    underlings collect and bank his rent. And if the rents from his vast
    land holdings weren&#8217;t enough, soaring property prices have escalated
    his net worth sky high &#8211; to be exact, UK&pound;11.5 billion. To give
    him his full title, he is <span style="font-weight: bold;">His Grace,
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gerald Grosvenor</span>, OBE,
    Sixth Duke of Westminster</span>.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Forget the vast tracts of rural land, including a 100,000-acre
    estate
    in Scotland which contains no less than three mountains. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">300 acres
    the duke owns in central London,</span> comprising Mayfair and
    Belgravia, are
    today one of the most valuable patches of ground on the planet.</span>
    <strong>... </strong></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The duke has nowadays diversified his land portfolio. His
    commercial
    property company, Grosvenor, has become a serious player, with a vast
    array of investments and developments around the world. These include
    office blocks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">San Francisco</span>,
    business parks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver</span>,
    luxury
    apartments in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hong Kong</span> and
    shopping centres in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spain </span>and
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Portugal</span>. In
    the UK, Grosvenor has developed Festival Place shopping centre in
    Basingstoke and is set to undertake a &pound;700m. mixed-use
    redevelopment in the centre of Liverpool. Back in his tract of Mayfair,
    land values are in the stratosphere: in 2001, BP&#8217;s pension fund sold
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">ten acres of Mayfair for a cool
&pound;335m.</span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Is it any wonder that, given how there is little or no land
    value
    taxation, the duke has all his many eggs in the land investment basket?
    But it&#8217;s not just for economic considerations that he could never
    contemplate selling his vast acreage, for he has a philosophical reason
    for not selling. (Have a bucket ready before reading the following!) <span

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
    one
    thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
    the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
    political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
    tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
    address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
    could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
    buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
    the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
    powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
    efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
    site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
    is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>

    <small>issues:&nbsp; <font size="3"><small><br>
    </small></font><font size="3"><small>Is ownership of land <i>value</i>
    concentrated? More so than other wealth? It's hard to unveil the
    largest landowners who own land under different names or corporations,
    or together with partners and family members. Best guesses tend to
    underestimate the concentration. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">One study of a Pennsylvania town
    of
    15,000 found that 1.5 percent of landowners owned 53 percent of the
    land value. Under a land tax, they would pay 53 percent of the revenue.</span></small></font><br>
    <font size="3"><small><br>
    How much of the central business district (CBD) is owned by
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absentees</span>? One
    argument for a hotel tax is that it taxes out-of-state
    visitors who don't vote (locally). Yet in North Carolina, for example,
    nine of the ten largest private landowners are headquartered
    out-of-state. In Los Angeles, more than half of the CBD is owned
    abroad. In all of LA, an even greater amount of land is held by
    absentee Americans due to chain stores owning land there but being
    based elsewhere.&nbsp; ... </small></font></small><br>
    <small><br>
    <font size="3"><small>Eventho' almost everyone would worry about paying
    more tax, the PTS is
    inherently progressive. Studies of the towns in Pennsylvania that have
    shifted some tax from buildings to land show that about 75% come out
    ahead (nearly the entire bottom four quintiles of income earners), 20%
    break even and <b>5% pay more (together a bit larger than the top
    quintile
    of income recipients), who are usually absentee owners. ... <br>

    solution which in turn needs a

    <p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment on Parts
        of the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985
study &#8220;Who Pays New York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>        As for their treatment of the New York Local Property Tax, the authors
          first identified seven separate categories of real property: owner-occupied,
          rental, commercial, industrial, public utilities, farmland, and unimproved.
          This is a somewhat unusual classification, different even than those
          universally used in New York State.7 One can see immediately that there
          will necessarily be some overlap &#8211; &#8220;unimproved&#8221; parcels
          can sometimes be assigned in other categories according to their zoning.
          And rental property is commercial, whomever the tenants may be, whether
          households or businesses.</p>
      <p>To their credit, however, the authors devoted considerable attention
        to the issue of tax shifting, which is never an easy subject, including
        a discussion of taxes on real property. They recognized that no shifting
        occurs for vacant parcels and titleholders therefore bear the full burden.
        So also for homeowners. For rental properties they assigned 50% of the
        burden to tenants, 25% to corporate stockowners, and 25% to real estate
        owners. For commercial, industrial, farmers, and public utility parcels,
        the shifting was put at 67%. In every instance where shifting is recognized,
        the part never shifted, of course, is the land component, and this is
        implicit in their assumption. These were referred to as &#8220;consensus
        incidence assumptions regarding the property tax.&#8221;8</p>
      <p>A third consideration they recognized is the potential for tax exporting
        to other states, more often important for classes other than residential
        property but still significant. It occurs both on account of titleholders
        being out-of-state and also because of what is known as the &#8220;federal
        offset,&#8221; i.e., the deductibility of state and local taxes for federal
        tax itemizing. For all New York State and local taxes taken together,
        they estimated that roughly 10% percent of total revenue is exported,
        but for real property taxes, the total exported is only about half that.</p>

    <p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington
        and the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
        argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity,
        and are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained
        them from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and
        natural resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every
        one of the N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal
        beds, 1/Nth of the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile
        soil. God wills a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own
        vine and his own fig tree.</p>
      <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership
        of land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in
        the absence of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale
        of land. (See Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his
        land is sell the use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared
        once every fifty years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned
        to its hereditary owner.</p>
      <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
        of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his
        bookkeeping expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally
        among the natural owners of the land, viz. the people of the country,
        with everyone receiving a dividend check regularly for the use of his
        share of the earth (here I am anticipating what I think George would
        have suggested if he had written in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
      <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
        of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements
        on it, practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not
        the original sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose
        to hold his &quot;fair share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay
        a land tax about equal to his dividend check, and so would break even.
        By 1/Nth of the land is meant land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the
        value of all the land in the country.</p>
      <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be
        worth as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer
        to hold more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some
        would prefer to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual
        check representing the dividend on their inheritance from their father
        Adam.</p>
      <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of
        poverty at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are
        enough to feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the
        land and 1/Nth of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the
        population. A family of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what
        their dividend checks will enable them to pay the tax on) will find that
        their labor applied to that land is enough to enable them to feed and
        clothe themselves. Of course, they may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere
        more profitably, but the situation from which we start is one in which
        everyone has his own plot of ground from which to wrest a living by the
        strength of his own back, and any deviation from this is the result of
        voluntary exchanges agreed to by the parties directly involved, who judge
        themselves to be better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
      <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is
        extremely conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic
        ideas about land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or
        vehicles or gold or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking
        countries uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal
        property (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not
        the opposite of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
        means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the
        people. Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
        term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that
        the landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
        for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to
        property other than land, although complications arise when there are
        buildings on the land that is being seized.</p>
      <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
        support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
        Huxley</a>, Woodrow
        Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo
        Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
        F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized by Alfred Nobel
        himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and the Henry George
        Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight of the Economics
        Laureates</a> as supporters, in
        whole or in part, of the proposals of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970;
        <a href="Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>, 1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco
        Modigliani, 1985; James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
        S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
      <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
        cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
        tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is
        about to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value
        of the land and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure
        you that real estate assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice
        to make the two assessments separately, and a parcel of land in the business
        district of a large city very often has a different owner from the building
        on it.) Many cities have moved to a system of taxing land more heavily
        than improvements, and most have been pleased with the results, finding
        that landholders are more likely to use their land productively -- to
        their own benefit and that of the public -- if their taxes do not automatically
        go up when they improve their land by constructing or maintaining buildings
        on it.</p>
      <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
        proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental
        and reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results
        of a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the
        difference in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other
        proposals of the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me
        absolute dictator of the world so that I can supervise the distribution,
        and if it doesn't work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that
        absolute dictators seldom resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read
