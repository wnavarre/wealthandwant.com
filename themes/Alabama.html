    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landownership imparts
      superior bargaining power&nbsp; </b>Labor starves, in contests of
      endurance; land endures.&nbsp; </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>A
      landowner is also a person with labor power.&nbsp; He or she can earn
      income like any worker.&nbsp; Landownership gives income above that,
      which gives <span style="text-decoration: underline;">discretionary </span>spending
      or waiting power.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>In contests with capital, land has the greater waiting power
      because
      over
      time capital depreciates, while land appreciates.&nbsp; Thus landowners
      (when free of heavy taxation) are noted for their patience.&nbsp;
      Patience is the essence of bargaining power.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Because land is fixed, more ownership by one person or group
      means less
      ownership by others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt, unavoidably.&nbsp;
      Thus, the expanding agent necessarily weakens others by the same stroke
      that strengthens himself.&nbsp; Landownership often gives market power
      in
      the sale of specific commodities and services. <a

    Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_2RiR.html">Two-Rate in Reverse</a><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1955, Spiro Agnew was a
      Maryland State Assemblyman on the rise.<span style="font-weight: bold;">
      He carried a new law that let tax assessors value farmland on its
"use-value" as farmland, instead of market value. It let owners who
      were farming for unearned increments around Baltimore and D.C. hold
      out with low carrying costs.</span> "Farmland" meant land used for
      farming,
      and any play at farming would qualify. Under this law, a relative of
      mine with 102 acres in Maryland near Western Avenue, the D.C. line,
      kept just two steers thereon to validate his farmland assessment
      status. Holding for the rise "never crossed his mind." Right --
      except, whenever such land is condemned for public use, courts
      everywhere have held that compensation must be based on speculative
      market value. ...</small><br>
      <small></small><br>
      <small><small></small>It is not just peri-urban land speculators who
      gain. A large
      chunk of land value in rural regions is not based on cash flow from
      food and fiber, but on amenities. Wisconsin is a major playground
      for rich urbanites from nearby Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and
      St. Paul. "Use-value" assessment exempts this chunk of value
      completely, for use-value is based on capitalizing the net cash farm
      income from growing crops, and, in the Wisconsin law, specifically
      corn. The highest land values per capita in the State are in Vilas
      County up in the north woods, once dismissed as worthless "cutovers."
      Vilas' barren podzol soils are worthless for corn, but sparkling
      lakes bedizen the County. Values per capita in Vilas are 6 times
      those in Milwaukee. Rich recreationists and "investors" (read
      speculators) are gobbling up the "wild forties." Shoreline parcels
    are like diamonds among coal.<strong> ... </strong></small><small><small></small></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">100
      years ago, American Georgists made a big point that city land
      outvalues rural land many times over. One implication is that
      taxing city land is taxing the rich, and we can ignore farmland. </span>Some
      land-taxers counsel that farmers are easily misled to oppose us,
      so leave them alone and convert the cities. But rich city folks also
      own choice rural lands.

    uttered his final "Rosebud."<span style="font-style: italic;"> The

      of the struggling family
    farmers whom use-value assessment of farmland saves from destitution.</span></small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The privilege of use-value
      assessment stretches even beyond
      farmlands, vast as they are. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Timberland
      </span>in most states gets the
      same preferred treatment, only better. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">About 1/3 of
      the privately
      owned land in the U.S. is in timber. </span>In California, owners
      (mostly
      huge corporations) may put the land into the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">"TPZ"</span> class. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
      standing timber is then exempt, and taxed only at harvest, at 2.9%,
      much too low a rate to make up for a 60-year lifetime of exemption.</span>
      County assessors have to value the land separately on its putative
      value for growing timber, following a State-legislated formula that
      is tailored drastically to understate even that low value (California
      Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Much
      of that land, though, has
      alternative uses, e.g. for retirement and vacation homes and resorts,
      the outliers and pioneers of urban sprawl. There are also mineral
      values, hunting, fishing, rifle ranges, grazing, campsites, tourism,
      rights of way, lumber camps, loading sites, water sources, lakes, log
      storage, landings - there are many things to do with 1/3 of a
      nation's land. <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Those uses are
      all declared "compatible" with timber,
      hence land values derived therefrom are tax-exempt.&nbsp; </span></span></small><small

        In California, some favored use-classes are farming, timber, and golf.

        and hunting grounds, catering to the Heston vote in league with absentee
        corporate owners (and, for no visible theological reason, organized fundamentalists).
        Lands in classified uses are assessed by capitalizing their visible money
        income from the official use only, thus exempting from the tax base all
        values from rustic manorial, recreational, and blood-sport uses, and
        all speculative values based on higher future uses. In vast rural and
