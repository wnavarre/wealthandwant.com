<blockquote>
  <p>Pennsylvania has had the enabling legislation that allows municipalities to
    tax land and buildings at different millage rates for about 90 years, and about
    17 cities and towns are using it, to good effect. Harrisburg is the most notable.</p>
  <p>Pennsylvania's taxes are complicated, in the sense that the individual property
    owner receives separate bills for schools and for other taxes, and because
    other municipal costs account for less of the tax bill than do the school taxes,
    the fact that municipalities use this and have seen fit to expand it is particularly
    notable. In some municipalities, the tax rate on land is six times that on
    buildings.</p>
  <p>Untaxing buildings leads to better buildings. Taxing land values more heavily
    nudges well-located land into better use, preserving the land on the fringe
    from premature development. </p>
  <p>Land Value Taxation is an excellent example of thinking globally and acting
    locally. </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>TPR - What's your take on the
Pennsylvania story? Are the landlords running scared from the new
'Whiskey Tax Rebellion'?</small><br>
<br>
<small>MG - Pennsylvania allows its cities what is called "local
option" on property tax policy. This gives each city the option of
down-taxing buildings and up-taxing land. An accelerating number of
cities have chosen this option, the latest being Allentown.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Landowners can't run, not without leaving their land behind; and
the idea is not to scare them, but show most of them they have more to
gain from un-taxing buildings than they lose from up-taxing land.
Un-taxing buildings encourages new building, with all the gains that
brings. When a city gets old and rundown, a lot of people get the point.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The opponents have several points from which to attack. Now they
are focusing on the State Legislature. As it happens, Harrisburg itself
is one of the cities that has adopted the option of down-taxing
buildings, and the good results may be seen by looking out the window;
but many legislators get their ideas and motivations from elsewhere.
The great danger to the movement in Pa. is that about when half the
cities will have chosen to down-tax buildings, the legislature will
follow the bad example of California and replace the property tax by
raising state income and sales taxes. ... <a

<p>  Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
    Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>For fans of democracy, the most recent victory of
the PTS came about via the initiative. The votes were cast in Allentown
(Pennsylvania is one of the few states that permits separate rates for
land and buildings). A key local leader knew of the success that
Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and other Pennsylvania towns had had with the
PTS and had the clout to make the shift part of a total revision of the
city charter. When the revision passed, propertied opponents put the
repeal of the PTS on the ballot separately. Advocates of the split
conducted a typical grassroots campaign of phone banking while
opponents relied on paid advertisements. Altho' the dollars spent
during the campaign heavily favored repeal, the voters heavily favored
keeping their new fiscal toy. ... <br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small> W.W.II, when its steel industry
plummeted,
Pittsburgh widened its two-to-one land-building ratio. The city watched
60 new buildings and skyscrapers, valued at $700 million then, stand up
in industrial areas. This privately financed renewal brought 16,000 new
jobs to an area that had employed 4,000. Then-Mayor David Lawrence,
noting the power of the stick, said the higher rate on land <i>"discouraged
hoarding of vacant land for speculation."</i> His successor, Mayor
Joseph Barr, noting the carrot effect, explained, <i>"Fine
structures erected through private investment as part of the renewal
program benefited by the lower tax rate on buildings."</i> When many
decaying cities were seeking federal aid, Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle
brought the city national fame.</small></font></small>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>In 1951 the Pennsylvania legislature
granted all cities the two-rate
choice, omitting any ratio limits. Over two decades later in 1975,
Harrisburg, the capitol, shifted its property tax landward. The value
of its private real estate grew from $212 million in 1981, when it was
cited as the second most distressed city in the nation, to over $880
million in 1994. Its mayor during much of this recovery, Stephen Reed,
noted another benefit: <i>"Many
states try to save farmland by buying development rights. That's
expensive. Without spending a dime, we can achieve the same goal with a
two-tier tax. Unused urban land is what pushes development into open
spaces. This tax, by assuring better use of unused land in cities and
suburbs, will discourage the gobbling up of farms."</i></small></font></small></p>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>
Ailing, small towns in distressed Appalachia passed the shift in the
eighties: McKeesport, New Castle, Duquesne, Washington, Aliquippa,
Clairton, Oil City. In 1990 Titusville chimed in. A year later
Coatesville, DuBois, Hazleton, and Lock Haven followed. In 1996, after
repeated vetoes by the mayor, Allentown came on board with its 100,000
residents. That makes 16 municipalities with the two-rate property tax.
All of them are growing by densification unlike many of their neighbors.
</small></font></small></p>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>
In 1992, Uniontown reversed its adoption of the PTS. (It was one of the
towns one of these co-authors lobbied. It seems he may have pushed to
hard. They accepted a higher initial rate which spurred a backlash
which scuttled the whole program. Damn eagerness!) Like many others in
the region, this city of 12,000 needed help; 80 percent of downtown
sites were empty. Their big mistake was to introduce the two-rate
reform under 34 year-old assessments which underestimated the value of
lots with abandoned structures. The few retailers left were hit with a
drastic increase. Moreover, officials did not give out public
information in advance. When people got their tax bills, they were
angered and uninformed, causing the city council to revoke the shift.</small></font></small></p>
<p><small><font size="3"><small>
While the 1951 law abolished ratio limits, it has been used only to
increase the land portion. In 1979, Pittsburgh moved to a three-to-one
ratio and in a few years moved to six-to-one. Six others have chosen
five-to-one. In 1995 Washington, 30 miles from Pittsburgh, shifted to
taxing land 11 times higher than buildings; Aliquippa to 16-to-one.
</small></font></small></p>
<small><font size="3"><small>
These spreads are diluted by overlapping counties and school districts
which still levy property taxes of one rate. When the city, county, and
school taxes are figured in, Pittsburgh is dampened to a 2.5-to-one
ratio. To address this lack of uniformity, the legislature granted
permission to school districts and boroughs the option to split their
rates. So far, only two noncity jurisdictions have taken advantage of
this option, totally 18 jurisdictions, including Pittsburgh, that have
opted for a higher rate on land and a lower one on buildings. Across
the Delaware River in New Jersey, officials recently held a public
hearing on the PTS. <strong>...</strong><br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>Eventho' almost everyone would
worry about paying more tax, the PTS is
inherently progressive. Studies of the towns in Pennsylvania that have
shifted some tax from buildings to land show that about 75% come out
ahead (nearly the entire bottom four quintiles of income earners), 20%
break even and 5% pay more (together a bit larger than the top quintile
of income recipients), who are usually absentee owners.<b> ... <br>
</b></small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>Starting in 1914, Pittsburgh and Scranton
introduced "the graded tax." Over a decade they phased in a higher rate
on land until it was twice the rate on buildings. Doing so gradually
allowed residents and businesses time to adapt, giving the PTS
political acceptability. Tho' this delayed benefits, land speculators
offered little opposition since they did not face the sudden effects of
the full shift. Such an approach is still prudent today.<strong> ... </strong></small></font><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

half the New Hampshire level.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Property tax reform in
Pennsylvania is, therefore, heavily
diluted. Add to that the problem of overlapping tax jurisdictions:
when a city reforms its property tax, its county and school district
carry on as before. What changes, then, is just 1/3 of 28%, or about
9% of the complex of state and local taxes. Federal taxes are totally
untouched. Trench warfare in Pennsylvania cities is therefore
inchmeal, and the results hard to measure. ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Eventho&#8217; its advocates must overcome the visceral dislike of the more
familiar tax on both land and buildings, the proposal to collect ground
rents has enjoyed popular support. In the mid 1990s, the people of
Allentown Pennsylvania (whose sorry state inspired pop singer Billy
Joel) voted twice to shift their property tax off buildings, onto
locations. They had to vote twice because after expressing their
preference the first time, the real estate lobby put the question on
the ballot again, where it passed by an even larger margin. Since
shifting its tax base, the town revitalized its center and
neighborhoods, drawing praise from Richard Florida in his <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Rise of the Creative Class</span>(2002).
Allentown is one of 20 jurisdictions in Pennsylvania that levy land
more highly than improvements. </small><small><a
