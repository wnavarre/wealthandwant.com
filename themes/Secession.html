Nic Tideman: <a
 href="../docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html">The
Constitutional Conflict Between Protecting
Expectations and Moral Evolution</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>3. The
Possibility of a Right of Secession</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But slavery is long gone. Of
what relevance, you may ask, are such
arguments today? I suggest that, some time in the next century or
two, a number of moral issues as momentous and contentious as slavery
will rise to public consciousness and pose the same issues of moral
advance versus the protection of financial interests that might be
thought of a property rights.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider the issue of secession.
While there is often a
correspondence between the borders of a nation and the set of persons
who want to identify with a particular nationality, there are many
instances when the preponderance of persons in a region would
strongly prefer not to be part of the nation that exercises
sovereignty over them--Chechins in Russia, Basques in Spain, Kurds in
Turkey, Iran and Iraq, Kashmiris in India, Catholics in Northern
Ireland, Hungarians in Serbia, Romaina, and Slovenia, Corsicans in
France, Palestinians in Israel, Christians in Sudan, and so on around
the globe. The particular locations of national borders are primarily
the result of wars. In many cases, the only justification that can be
given for borders apart from "If you try to take what I claim, I'll
kill you," is that any acknowledgement that borders were subject to
question would lead to interminable conflict, so we are better off
abiding by what we have than allowing the question to be opened.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But this puts the advocates of
maintaining existing borders in the
potentially uncomfortable position of needing to support every
"reasonable" government that seeks to suppress its secessionists.
This then necessitates an evaluation of the reasonableness of the
complaints of every minority with regard to language, religion,
education, the provision of public services, marriage rules,
child-rearing practices, tolerated intoxicants, and every other area
of social life about which people can disagree. The person who wants
to support the efforts of a government to suppress its secessionist
minorities must be able to say that in every area where the
government imposes a rule on the minority, no right that the minority
ought to have is violated. It is becoming increasingly difficult to
sustain a claim that it is possible to know what rights minorities
deserve. I predict that within a century, humanity will come to a
consensus that the right of a defined unit to secede from a larger
governmental entity is a basic human right, that no nation or
administrative sub-unit is entitled to cling to control of a compact
sub-unit whose citizen are united in their desire not to be
controlled by the larger entity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Already we may be seeing the first
signs of this. Czechoslovakia
was peacefully partitioned into The Czech Republic and Slovakia,
although the fact that this seems to have been mutually desired makes
it less evidential for the thesis. The Kremlin acquiesced with only a
little grumbling to the dismantling of the USSR. Here one might
propose that with democracy looming, it was valuable for Russians to
ensure that they would not become a minority in their own nation.
After some fighting, the international community pressured the
remnants of Yugoslavia to accept the departure of Slovenia, Croatia
and Bosnia. Canada seems to acknowledge implicitly that if the people
of Quebec really want to no longer be part of Canada, they may have
their way. When Quebecoi insist that Native American tribes that want
to remove their tribal lands from the jurisdiction of Quebec must
never be allowed to do so, they sound inconsistent. This is not
enough evidence to make a convincing case, but it may be straws in
the wind. Still, in so many other cases, there is little if any
general international support for the efforts of secessionists.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>4. The
Complementary Right of Equal Access to Natural Opportunities</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of the factors that makes
the case for secession difficult is
the problem of regional inequality in natural resources. When the
people who called themselves Biafrans sought to secede from Nigeria
in the 1960s, the morality of their claim was undermined by the fact
that, if they had succeeded, they would have taken disproportionate
oil resources from the rest of Nigerians. The limited support for the
efforts of the Chechins to separate from Russia is explained in part
by the understanding that, even though the Chechins have been abused
by Russians for centuries and have never fully acceded to their
incorporation into Russia, if Chechniya were allowed to separate from
Russia, that would create a precedent that would make it difficult to
oppose an effort by the people of the sparsely populated Yakutsia
region of Eastern Siberia, rich in oil and diamonds, to insist that
they too have a right to be a separate nation. ... <br>
<br>
If a very sharp and deeply felt division of opinion about the proper
role of the state developed, then it would be sensible to allow the
minority to secede. There is nothing sacred or inevitable about any
particular number of nations or their borders. If a majority allows a
disgruntled minority, who are a majority in a particular region, to
leave and take territory with them, then the remaining majority will
avoid a potential problem of underpopulation and excessive claims to
natural opportunity that would occur if the minority were to simply
emigrate.<br>
<br>
The dissatisfied minority can make a claim for an opportunity to secede
on the following basis: The prior claim to territory is based on the
rights of the minority as well as the majority to equal shares of
natural opportunities. The minority have rights to themselves. They
should not be obliged to live in a type of nation they do not want.
They may find all other nations unacceptable, or other nations may find
the dissatisfied minority unacceptable. Justice requires that there be
some way in which the dissatisfied minority can receive their rightful
share of natural opportunities, free of obligations that entangle them
with others, so it is proper for them to expect to be able to sever
their share from the territorial rights that belong jointly to the
majority and the minority.<br>
<br>
The majority could justly require the minority to take their share of
rights in whatever territory the majority wished to cede, provided that
the ratio of the value of the territory so ceded to the value of the
territory retained was roughly equal to the ratio of the minority to
the majority, with any discrepancy settled by periodic cash payments.
The majority might also reasonably require the minority to pay any
costs of the separation.<br>
<br>
When the people of a nation ensure that they do not claim more than
their shares of natural opportunities, when they permit any citizen who
desires to leave to do so, and they stand ready to allow any
substantial majority within a reasonably compact subarea to succeed,
then the people of that nation can justly say, "The laws we choose to
live under represent our conception of what a nation ought to be. If
you don't like it, create your own nation somewhere else. We claim for
ourselves no more than our share of what nature provides." Thus a wide
variety of arrangements within nations are consistent with justice.

about the types of nations that
can be expected to emerge in such a world. As mentioned previously,
one would expect fewer barriers to immigration, since immigrants
would arrive with claims to their shares of natural opportunities.
Also, nations could expect to have greater difficulty retaining
citizens when they had either low wages, low returns to saving, or
laws that people found oppressive. ...&nbsp; <a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Similarly, the localities within a
national subdivision are free
to implement a pattern of locality entitlements that differs from the
ones described, provided that they allow any locality to "emigrate."
Since locations do not move, "emigration" here means secession. But
secession is potentially expensive, because of the difference in the
way that entitlements are calculated when membership in larger
entities changes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For example, suppose that Toronto
wanted to secede from Ontario
and become a separate province. As long as Toronto is a part of
Ontario, the group that shares the rental value of Toronto (in an
unimproved condition) consists of all Ontario localities. If Toronto
were to become a separate province, that rental value would be shared
among all Canadian provinces, and a much smaller share would come
back to Toronto. The opportunity to share such rent would be glue
that would tend to bind localities in provinces and provinces in the
nation. But if the pressures to separate ever became great enough,
the right to do so would be recognized. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If localities are permitted to
secede from national subdivisions
in place of emigrating, one might ask whether individuals may secede
from nations. The answer is, in principle, yes, but it is likely to
be impractical for them to do so, except on the fringe of
civilization. If an individual who wants to declare himself an
independent nation, the share of rent that he can claim is the land
value per person in the equalization of rent among nations. But,
unless he wants to live on the edge of civilization, he will need
land in the midst of other people, where rents will be very high.
Furthermore, his neighbors would not be treating him unjustly if they
responded to his secession with an economic boycott. Thus it could be
expected that people would not propose to secede in the middle of
existing jurisdictions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When all individuals and
jurisdictions are free to emigrate and to
secede in whatever ways they find practical, and equal access to
natural opportunities for all members of any entity is the default
option from which the entity is free to depart, then any taxes that
are imposed as a condition of continued membership in the entity are
consistent with Neutrality. People really can go somewhere else if
they don't like it, and the equal access to natural opportunities
required by Liberalism is satisfied. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If people were entirely
selfish, and if outcomes were dominated by
competition among jurisdictions, then in the Liberal world that has
been described we would see efficient taxes -- on externalities and
on the appropriation of natural opportunities. To the extent that
people have feelings of community and of compassion for one another,
we would find people agreeing to accept obligations to share the
rewards of their efforts with others, though justice could not oblige
them to do so. </small><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>...&nbsp; <a

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The Morality of Taxation:
The Local Case</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is a gentler side of taxation that provides some explanation of our
    tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that people achieve their
    common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so that there will be money
    to pay for public services that they want. From this perspective, taxation
    may
    be considered no more than the dues for belonging to a club that provides
    people with things that they would rather pay their share of than do without.
    However,
    to make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people must
    be able to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to be a citizen
    of the taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by some taxing jurisdiction,
    the choice isn't exactly free.</p>
  <p>The problem of morality in taxation is the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How do we retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions
          to the cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
          the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
      of plunder? </li>
    <li>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly impose on our fellow
          citizens? </li>
    <li>And how do we set up a structure of government that will ensure that
      these limits are observed? </li>
  </ul>
  <p> The turn-of-the-century Swedish economist, Knut Wicksell, had ideas that
    dealt with some of these questions (Wicksell, 1958 [1896]). Wicksell argued
    that if
    a public expenditure is worthwhile, then there must be some allocation among
    citizens of the taxes that are needed to finance the expenditure that would
    make everyone better off. If legislatures were required to achieve unanimity
    to pass
    spending programs, then they would have to find allocations of taxes that
    were unanimously acceptable before they could pass those programs. In that
    case, majorities
    would have no opportunity to exploit minorities, and inefficient proposals
    would be prevented from passing as well. Wicksell recognized that if complete
    unanimity
    were required, strategic holdouts would be likely to prevent any program
    from passing, so he was content to recommend a rule of "near-unanimity," without
    being specific about what this meant. </p>
  <p>While Wicksell's insights are interesting, they do not fully solve the problem
      of moral taxation, because any departure from unanimity opens the door to
      exploitation of minorities, and the requirement of more-than-majority approval
      means that the costs of coalition-building will leave some worthwhile activities
      unapproved. Still, we would probably have a much more efficient public sector
      if every public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative bodies.</p>
  <p>But to make taxation truly voluntary, the option to leave must be viable.
      If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to another, taking
      all of their belongings with them, then competition among jurisdictions would
      tend to eliminate oppressive taxation. This would leave only the fees that
      people were prepared to pay to have public services (Tiebout, 1956). ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">read

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_PEME.html">The Political Economy of Moral
Evolution</a> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This paper argues that a liberal theory of the resolution of disagreements
      about the requirements of justice must include the possibility of secession.
      When such a possibility is allowed, it can be predicted that there will be
      changes not only in the character of disputes about the requirements of justice,
      but also in the patterns of taxes and public expenditures. There will be
      a greater propensity for seeing the other side's point of view in disputes
      about the requirements of justice, and a greater tendency to support public
      activities by efficient taxes on the beneficiaries of public
  expenditures.</p>
    <p>The paper begins with a discussion of the nature of moral truth, its relation
      to scientific truth, and the way in which moral knowledge grows. Next discussed
      is the difficulty of translating moral knowledge into social institutions,
      arising from the inevitability and impropriety of judging one's own cause.
      Ackerman's "neutral dialogue" is endorsed as the most acceptable way of
      dealing with this difficulty. But I suggest that in dialogues regarding
      the requirements
      of justice there should be an understanding that one possible outcome of
      the dialogue is failure to agree on mutually acceptable conditions for
      being part of the same society, leading to a parting of the ways. The conditions
      under which such a parting would occur constitute the most fundamental
      question
      of justice. I suggest that Ackerman's proposed condition of equal sharing
      of the providence of nature (Ackerman's initial manna) among all generations
      constitutes an appropriate basis for parting if agreement should be impossible.</p>
    <p>I argue that such an understanding of the possibility of secession would
      provide a better framework for the growth of moral knowledge than when the
      politically successful are able to preclude experiments with alternative
      conceptions of justice. It would also reduce opportunities for the politically
      adroit to exploit the less adroit. If competition among societies for citizens
      resulted from the possibility of secession, the competitive equilibrium would
      include land value taxation. <strong>...</strong></p>
    <p>There are several practical difficulties with secession as the resolution
    of moral disagreement that need to be mentioned. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, as long as the world seems so hostile that defense against foreign
            invasion is required, there will be efficiencies in defending larger
        areas. </li>
      <li>Second, when sovereignty is fragmented, there will be a temptation
        to levy taxes that will be paid predominantly by foreigners. It was in
        response
            to the recognition of this that the U.S. Constitution included a
        ban on taxes in interstate commerce. The same impulse can be seen today
        in the
            desire of localities to impose taxes on restaurant meals, backed
        up by the argument that a substantial fraction of such a tax is paid
        by people
            from out of town. </li>
      <li>Third, if any partition were undertaken, there would be likely to be
            numerous people who found themselves on the wrong side of the dividing
            line, as happened so tragically when Pakistan was partitioned from
        India.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I will respond to these in order. ... </p>
    <p>So suppose that those who wished to secede claimed no more land and natural
      resources per capita than were available to others, but they constituted
      a group that was distinctly more capable than average. Could those who were
      left behind argue that this departure
  of talent was unfair to them? ... </p>
    <p>With respect to tax and expenditure decisions, politically active special
      interests would face an important additional limitation in their efforts
      to exploit the rest of the public: An exploited group could secede. While
      the costs of secession would limit the use of secession as a device for avoiding
      exploitation, the need to be sensitive to this possibility would create pressure
      for benefit-related taxation and for an efficient public sector. If alternative
      states are viewed as competing for citizens, one can ask what offers potential
      citizens would receive from states. The answer from economic theory is that
      each citizen would be offered his marginal product, plus the rent on the
      share of land and natural resources to which the state would have a claim
      by virtue of his citizenship. Competitive pressures would induce states to
      refrain from taxing labor incomes, unless there were social costs associated
      with the generation of income. Future capital accumulations would similarly
      tend to escape taxation. Thus land, natural resources and previously accumulated
      capital would be the only tax bases not subject to erosion by competitive
    pressure. <a href="docs/Tideman_PEME.html">read the whole article</a></p>
