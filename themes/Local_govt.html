of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, supposing we should abolish all other
    taxes direct and indirect, substituting for them a tax upon land values,
    what would be the effect?
In the first place it would be to kill speculative values. It would be
to remove from the newer parts of the country the bulk of the taxation
and put it on the richer parts. It would be to exempt the pioneer from
taxation and make the larger cities pay more of it. It would be to
relieve energy and enterprise, capital and labour, from all those
burdens that now bear upon them. What a start that would give to
production! In the second place we could, from the value of the land,
not merely pay all the present expenses of the government, but we could
do infinitely more. In the city of San Francisco James Lick left a few
blocks of ground to be used for public purposes there, and the rent
amounts to so much, that out of it will be built the largest telescope
in the world, large public baths and other public buildings, and
various costly works. If, instead of these few blocks, the whole value
of the land upon which the city is built had accrued to San Francisco
what could she not do?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">So in this little town
[Burlington, Iowa], where land values are very low as compared with
such cities as Chicago and San Francisco, you could do many things for
mutual benefit and public improvement did you appropriate to public
purposes the land values that now go to individuals. </span>You could
have a great free library; you could have an art gallery; you could get
yourselves a public park, a magnificent public park, too. You have here
one of the finest natural sites for a beautiful town I know of, and I
have travelled much. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You
might make on this site a city that it would be a pleasure to live in.</span>
You will not as you go now &#8212; oh, no! Why, the very fact that you have a
magnificent view here will cause somebody to hold on all the more
tightly to the land that commands this view and charge higher prices
for it. The State of New York wants to buy a strip of land so as to
enable the people to see Niagara, but what a price she must pay for it!
Look at all the great cities; in Philadelphia, for instance, in order
to build their great city hall they had to block up the only two wide
streets they had in the city. Everywhere you go you may see how private
property in land prevents public as well as private improvement.&nbsp;

<blockquote>
  <p>    <em>Q5. If the full rental value were taken would it not produce too much revenue
      and encourage official extravagance? If only what was needed for an economical
      administration of government, would not land still have a speculative value?</em><br>
    A. In the first part of your question you are thinking of a vast centralized
    government as administering public revenues. With the revenues raised locally,
    each locality being assessed for its contribution to the state and the nation,
    there would be no such danger. The possibility of this danger would be still
    further reduced by the fact that private business would then offer greater
    pecuniary prizes than would public office, wherefore public office would
    be sought for purer purposes than as money-making opportunities. As to the
    second part of your question, the speculative value of land would be wiped
    out as soon as the tax on land values was high enough and that on improvement
    values low enough to make production more profitable than speculation. And
    this point would be reached long before the whole rental value was absorbed
    in taxation. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

A. However poor the town or heavy the taxes, it would at least tend the equalize
their present tax burden. The assessed value of land in the three smallest towns
of Massachusetts, Alford, Holland, and Peru, is $282,335, or more than three
times that of the buildings. Allowing one half of the assessed valuation of land
to be improvement value, the unimproved basis for taxation would be $141,168,
or 60 percent more than the buildings. Thus an apportionment according to unimproved
land values, increasing ever so slowly, would seem to be fairer than one according
to improvements, which require constant renewal. ... <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE SOURCE OF PUBLIC
REVENUE </b></small><br>
<small>What are the factors that cause land to have market value and to
whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
market value for three reasons: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
productivity of the soil and natural resources, 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>the publicly provided
services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
value of land and 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>the growth of communities and peoples'
competitive
demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that people
and businesses are willing to
pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
be used as revenue, by the
community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
for the period of time.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>ENVIRONMENTAL
PRESERVATION </b></small><br>
<small>It is the responsibility of the local communities to insure that
the market rent of land is collected for public purposes. When a
major part of land rent is not collected, which is the case in most
of the world today, land title holders obtain rights to sell the
value of the public improvements which were made by the whole
community. The community added to the market value of land by making
improvements which increases demand and rent for the land. The longer
the possessors hold the land out of use the greater will be the bonus
they obtain.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By prohibiting people from using
good land, the possessors force
the premature use of other less desirable land, which is more distant
from the city. This raises the cost of community improvements and the
rental value of the unused, but better located, land. This
precipitates the degradation of the rural environment by using city
land inefficiently -- and creates huge unnecessary pressures on the
natural environment.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A problem that we face is that
cities throughout the world are
spreading out and using land prematurely which is not needed and
should not be used. That is because failure to collect land rent
subsidizes the waste of natural resources and clutters the
environment. Cities that collect the full rental value of land are
more compact and provide greater and less costly amenities for their
citizens.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any moves to enact good government
principles without collecting
the full market rent of the land may result in a failure. People are
guided by the profit motive. When people can make a larger profit by
doing nothing, but keeping the land they possess out of use for a
long period of time, they will do so. When the community collects the
full market rent of land, they eliminate the motive for keeping land
out of efficient use, because the unearned profit has been collected
as public revenue.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Efficient land use appeals to all
people because it surpasses the
political constraints of most people. Everybody understands that the
earth belongs equally to all people. They want a clean environment on
earth and to leave a healthy inheritance to the future generations,
regardless of their political viewpoints.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The major function of a competent
city government is to provide
good community services by collecting the land rent created within
the community to ensure the efficient use of land and equal
opportunities for all of its citizens. Transportation is an important
function of government which would facilitate the creation of a
compact city, where people can easily find the facilities they desire
for education, commerce, religion and recreation. Good
land use, with the freedom of individuals to achieve the highest and
best use of land, would ensure a desirable community. A compact city
would reduce the need to invade the wilderness and devastate the
environment.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Adam Smith, in The Wealth of
Nations, suggested that any "tax"
should be a charge for services which benefit all people and are more
efficiently preformed by a single cooperative effort. He postulated
four principles of taxation which any source of revenue should
meet:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote>
    <p><small>1. Light on the
    production of wealth, and does not impede
    or reduce production; </small>
    </p>
    <p><small>2. Cheap to collect, requiring few collectors, and easy to
    understand;</small>  </p>
    <p><small>3. Certain; can't be avoided, little opportunity for
    corruption,
    and provides adequate revenue;</small></p>
  </blockquote>
  <small> </small>
  <blockquote>
    <p><small>4. Equitable and fair, payment for benefits received,
    impartial,
    and just.</small></p>
  </blockquote>
<small></small></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Collecting public revenue from
land rent is the only revenue
source, or "tax", that meets these criteria.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While the major argument for
raising public revenue from land rent
and natural resources is because it is equitable and fair, it is also
the most efficient method of raising the revenue which is needed for
public facilities and services. Land is visible, can't be hidden and
its valuation is less intrusive than valuations of income and sales.
Taxes on labor and capital cause people to consider alternative
options, including working with less effort, which produces less real
goods. For example, a tax on wages will reduce after-tax net wages
and weaken the incentive to work. A person might be willing to work
hard for a wage of $20 per hour, but decide to drop out if the taxes
take $8 and the net wage is only $12 per hour. Economists claim that
present taxes account for a 25% loss in production in the United
States. Production and consumption would be greatly improved if
public revenue came primarily from land rather than a wage tax. The
same would occur when buildings and machinery are taxed. The tax on
building reduces the quantity and quality of buildings produced. A
tax on sales, commerce or value added reduces consumption, production
and net wealth. Sales tax evasion in the United States has exceeded
30% in recent years.</small></p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>As new
inventions and more
efficient ways of producing goods are
discovered, people's economic well-being is not improved, because
they have lost access to land and must pay both rent and taxes. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)</span>
Instead of rent being used to provide community services, capital and
wages must be depleted, which obstructs private enterprise.</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
taken for public purposes production and
distribution are not held back. This is because<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> the same amount of
rent would otherwise have been taken by some private individual</span>.
The
rent would be the same, the difference is how it is utilized. </span>There
is evidence that communities who raise their revenue from land,
rather than from labor and capital, are more prosperous, many
increasing productivity by more than 25% <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(6)</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>HOW MUCH LAND RENT
SHOULD THE COMMUNITY COLLECT? </b>
<br>
In order to preserve the environment, it is necessary and possible
to better utilize our communities. If the producers of the land
market value (nature, government and people) don't utilize land rent,
someone else will. This is why efficient land use fails under
contemporary land systems in most countries. All countries collect
some of the land rent, perhaps 10%, 20% or 30%, but none yet, collect
all of the market rent of land.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Studies have been produced that
demonstrate that communities
prosper and succeed in proportion to the percentage of the land rent
that they collect. The first communities that decide to collect all
of the ground rent will have an enormous competitive advantage over
all other communities. They will be able to reduce or eliminate
regressive taxes on labor and capital. They will attract new business
and industry and become prosperous.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>To determine how much land rent
the community should collect
let's consider the alternatives. Whatever is not collected will be
capitalized into market value by land owners. Buying land at inflated
market prices is a block to new industry. Land owners sell the
capitalized land rent (known as land value) which is uncollected by
the community even though it is unearned income. This causes a
disparity between landowners and non-landowners. In the United States
5% of the population, which does not include many homeowners or
farmers, own 70% of the total national land and natural resource
values.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>People will come to a well run
community because they will be
better off than living by themselves or in an impoverished locale. A
city must secure revenue in order to provide good quality
services.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This revenue can best be procured
when the community recaptures
the value of the benefits and services that it provides. This is done
by collecting the rental revenue from land that reflects the value of
the services and facilities provided in that community. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The land rent
belongs equally to all people that live in the locale who helped to
produce that value. In a well run community. there is sufficient land
rent to provide adequate funding for the social purposes requested
of, and provided by, the local city government</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cities which choose to collect
land rent as their primary source
of revenue have the advantage of not requiring burdensome taxes to be
paid by workers, businesspeople, entrepreneurs or citizens.
Individuals who work to create wealth should be allowed to keep what
they produce. When labor is not taxed, greater production and
consumption occurs. Investment capital is formed which is used to
produce more wealth. New jobs are created and economic diversity
results.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Each person has a right to keep
what he or she produces, but no
one has the right to waste what belongs to all people, the land which
includes the natural environment. Each person should have an
opportunity to use the best land for his business or personal needs,
as long as they are willing to pay the land rent that other land
users are willing to pay.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If
the value of land rent exceeds the community's needs for public
services a method of dispensing of the surplus revenue can easily be
found. </span>To maintain an equitable society, where nobody has
special
benefits that they do not pay for, it is important to collect all of
the land rent. The community should use what is needed for public
services and improvements such as schools, hospitals, parks, police,
roadways, utilities and defense -- and reserve a fund for
emergencies.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>An ethical
proposal might be to then divide the excess revenue
that is not needed for public facilities and services at the end of
each year and send each citizen in that community an equal portion of
the remaining revenue. This is similar to the method used in Alaska
and Alberta. Equality of opportunity to be productive can only be
accomplished by recapturing all of the market rent of land and
ensuring that all people benefit from its value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent potentially
an important source of public
revenue, collecting all of it would ensure that the equal opportunity
to be productive would be available to all citizens. People could
fund useful buildings, equipment and wages, rather than having to buy
land at inflated prices. Many countries, including the United States,
were started on the premise of using land rent to fund public
services. Many countries suffer economic loss because they no longer
collect the market rent of land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The value of land can be estimated
with an acceptable accuracy, at
a cost which is very small compared to the revenue to be obtained. A
proper system of assessment and taxation of land can provide for the
proper economic use of the land. A land site should be available to
the user who can make the highest and best use of the site and
maximize the site benefits for all people. A land tax can provide a
major source of public revenue which the local governing body could
use for the benefit of all people. A land tax can prevent the
dispossession of our children, the future producers in the society.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Justice requires that land values, which are created by society and
nature, be made available for public improvements. This is the
responsibility of good government.</span>. <a

        land fraction in real estate is generally highest in the CBD of any city,
        so that is a favorite place for absentees to buy and hold. They like

    and the Land Value Tax Perspective </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>How to Do It in
    Asheville</b> </p>
  <p>What are the steps to be taken to implement land value taxation in Asheville?
    First, there has to be broad support for this idea at the grass roots. The
    public must understand the theory and practice of land value taxation. At the
    same time the city government, the Mayor and Council, must understand and support
    the proposed change. Then, a state law must be enacted giving Asheville the
    option of shifting to a two-rate tax, and then the Council must pass a local
    ordinance adopting the two-rate tax and setting the rates. </p>
  <p>Easier said than done, but not impossible. The single biggest problem will
    be inertia, simple resistance to change. Everyone favors change when it applies
    to others. That's a given, but this is a common sense idea which, when properly
    introduced and explained, can generate public support. The experience in Allentown,
    Pennsylvania, where there were two referenda on this question, both of which
    won the support of the majority, gives us confidence that it can be done here.
    There's lots of support available to help you on your way. </p>
  <p><b>It's So Good, You've Got to
    Try It!</b>
  </p>
  <p>There are many advantages to land value taxation other than the ones already
    stated: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">No State or Federal aid is needed to implement
          this idea.</span> After the necessary legislation is passed, only a change
          in computer programming is needed to change the tax bills. </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is a very progressive tax. </span>We
          believe, in taxation, that the rich should pay more than the poor.
      The poor own or use very little land and will pay very little land tax.

          class owns only the land under their homes and will pay modest amounts
      of land tax. <span style="font-weight: bold;">All large and valuable tracts
          of land are owned by corporations or wealthy individuals, they will pay the
          most land tax.</span> </li>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
  <p>It's been an axiom of urban policy for the past half century to lament the
      plight of American cities &#8212; that they have lost their most productive
      populations, that their infrastructure is deteriorated and obsolete, that they
      contain people most in need, and that their tax base is limited. This essay
      argues that none of this needs to be so, and that municipal leaders need only
      to think &quot;outside the box&quot; as the hackneyed phrase goes, to find
      undreamed of revenue that will not only provide all the support cities
      need but enhance the economic vitality of their being by its collection.</p>
  <p>As conventionally viewed, cities not only have need for more services but
      lack the tax base on which to draw from. The services are greater in cities
      than in suburban and rural communities because that's where streets and other
      general services are the heaviest, where the schools are the greatest challenge,
      where the police and fire departments are most relied upon, where the social
      programs face the greatest pathologies, and where general administration is
      the most complex and requires the greatest control and coordination. It seems
      so obvious that it hardly needs mentioning, and no further discussion is required.</p>
  <p>At the same time, so the argument goes, the revenue bases upon which to
    levy taxes are most lacking: the middle class and the wealthier populations
    have
      largely moved out, and stores have relocated to malls and highway junctions
      taking the sales tax base with them. What's left are deteriorating buildings
      and a complaining citizenry: the footloose commercial and industrial sector
      also threatens to relocate along with a residential population feeling
    strangled by growing municipal and school taxes on real property. A few cities
    have reached
      beyond taxation of property and sales to impose one more &#8212; an income
      tax &#8212; on top of the others. And greater reliance upon user fees and
      on privatized services shifts the burden increasingly to the poor. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

  Rights Democracy: Public Finance based on Early Christian Teachings</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Perceptions of the causal
factors of these statistics and the suffering
of so many who lack basic necessities in this wealthy country are most
often simplistic explanations - these people lack money and they lack
money because they lack jobs or their wages are too low, or housing
costs are too high. For those concerned about the growing wealth gap in
America and worldwide, and the resultant poverty, homelessness, hunger
and food insecurity, the dilemma usually bogs down into supply or
demand side efforts to find solutions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">But the root cause is a
deeper injustice.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The primary cause of the
enormous and
growing wealth gap is that the land and natural resources of the earth
are treated as if they are mere market commodities from which a few are
allowed to reap massive private profits or hold land and resources out
of use in anticipation of future profits. </span>Henry George, the
great 19th century American political economist and social philosopher,
proposed a solution to a problem that too few understood at the time
and too few understand today. Early Christian teachings drew upon deep
wisdom teachings of the Jubilee justice tradition when they addressed
this problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is the Land
Problem.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
Land Problem takes two primary forms: land price escalation and
concentrated land ownership.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As our system of economic
development proceeds, land values rise faster than wages increase,
until inevitably the price paid for access to land consumes increasing
amounts of a worker's wages. In classical economics, this dilemma is
called the "law of rent" and has been mostly ignored by mainstream
economists. The predictability of the "law of rent" - that land values
will continually rise - fuels frenzies of land speculation and the
inevitable bust that follows the boom.</span> A recent <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>cover
story informs us that there are big gains and huge risks in housing
speculation in about 30 predominantly coastal markets that encompass
100 million people. Since 2000, home prices in New York, Washington,
and Boston have surged 56% to 61%. Prices jumped 58% in Miami and Los
Angeles and 76% in San Diego where the median home price county-wide is
$582,000. The gap between home prices and fundamentals like job growth
and incomes is greater than ever.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The
second form of the Land Problem is the fact that in most countries,
including the United States, a small minority of people own and control
a disproportionately large amount of land and natural resources.</span></small>
Data suggests that about 3% of the population owns 95% of the privately
held land in the US. Less than 600 companies control 22% of our private
land, a land mass the size of Spain. Those same companies land
interests worldwide comprise a total area larger than that of Europe -
almost 2 billion acres.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[8]</span>    </small> </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In order to show that there was
NO NEED for land reform in Central
America because our land in the US is even more concentrated in
ownership than Central America, Senator Jesse Helms read these facts
into the Congressional Record in 1981: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In Florida, 1% owns 77% of the land. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Other states where the top 1% own over two-thirds of the
land are Maine, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon.
    <strong>... </strong>    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George, the great American
political economist and land rights
philosopher (1839-1897), eloquently confronted the enigma of the wealth
gap in his masterwork <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty </span></a>and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">set forth both an ethical and practical
method for holding and sharing the land as a sacred trust for all. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>He made <span style="font-weight: bold;">a clear
distinction between property in land and property in wealth produced by
labor on land</span>. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>He said that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> private
property in
human made wealth belonged to the producer and that the state should
not tax wealth produced by human labor.</span>    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George said:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>To abolish these taxes would be
to lift
the whole enormous weight of taxation from productive industry. The
needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory; the cart-horse and
the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship; the farmer's plow
and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would be free to
make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, un-annoyed by the
tax-gatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, "The
more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!" the
state would say to the producer,</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small>"Be as industrious, as thrifty,
as
enterprising as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall
not be fined for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before;
you shall not be taxed for adding to the aggregate wealth.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[17]</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>In an economic system such as ours which uses money as a medium
of exchange, land and resources come to have monetary value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In
asserting that the gifts of nature are common property and should be
equitably shared by all, George saw that in a just society the
ownership of land and natural resources would be conditional upon the
cash payment to all of a fairly assessed tax, or land rent, for the
exclusive right to God's gifts. Thus the collection of land rent for
the community as a whole would replace the taxation of productive
endeavors. Those with more and/or better located land would pay more
into the common fund, while those with little or no land would pay much
less or nothing at all.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>As George explained it:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>...the value of land is at the
beginning of society nothing, but as society develops by the increase
of population and the advance of the arts, it becomes greater and
greater. In every civilized country, even the newest, the value of the
land taken as a whole is sufficient to bear the entire expenses of
government. In the better developed countries it is much more than
sufficient. Hence it will not be enough merely to place all taxes upon
the value of land. It will be necessary, where rent exceeds the present
governmental revenues, commensurately to increase the amount demanded
in taxation, and to continue this increase as society progresses and
rent advances.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[18]</span></small><br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The author of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Common Sense</span> was onto the same idea
when he said:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Men did not make the earth...It
is the
value of the improvement only, and not the earth itself, that is
individual property...Every proprietor owes to the community a ground
rent for the land which he holds. - Tom Paine
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enormous sums are currently
accruing
as unearned income to a relatively few individuals, families and
corporations who are holding large amounts of land, very valuable and
well-located land, and natural resources as their own exclusive private
property.</span> These enormous land values and resource rents are also
accruing as unearned income to banks holding mortgages based on
exploitative compound interest rates. It may be of interest to note
that the word "mortgage" means "dead hand." Truly, when one must work
so many years of one's life to pay off a mortgage, one productive hand
is as if dead in terms of producing for oneself, as the labor of that
hand pays the mortgage. For the 33% of citizens (40 million people) in
the United States who are renters, there is not even equity ownership
to look forward to after a life of labor. For the more than three
million homeless people in American and the multi-millions who are
homeless around the world, what Henry George said in 1879 holds true
today:</small><br>
<br>
<small>Our primary social adjustment is a
denial of justice. In allowing one man to own the land on which and
from which other men must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a
degree which increases as material progress goes on.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[19] ... </span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>The policy approach urged by Henry George and Thomas Paine as a
way to
assure human rights to the earth's resources was successfully
implemented in part and to varying degrees in several places throughout
the world.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As a result of decades of steady education and promulgation,
there are
now 18 municipalities in Pennsylvania which have adopted a so-called
split-rate property tax which shifts taxes away from buildings and onto
land according to site value. This approach is based on the
understanding that the property tax is actually two types of taxes --
one upon building values, and the other upon land values. This
distinction is an important one, as these two types of taxes have
significantly different impacts on incentive motives and development
results. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Decreasing the tax on buildings gives property owners the
incentive to build and to maintain and improve their properties. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>As the levy on land values is increased, land speculation
and
poor land utilization, an example being slum buildings and boarded up
buildings, are discouraged. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
signal thus sent to property holders is to either improve their
properties or sell them to someone who can do so. </span>    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>Either way, labor and
capital gain access to land to improve and
augment the building stock. The tax incentives are harnessed correctly
to encourage effort directed to the provisioning of housing and other
basic human needs.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[24]</span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Shifting the tax burden in this way </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>discourages land hoarding and encourages good land
utilization. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>It promotes a more efficient use of urban infrastructure
(such as roads and sewers), 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>decreases the pressure towards urban sprawl (as there is
significant infill development), and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>assures a broader spread of the benefits of development to
the community as a whole.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Researchers have carefully
recorded the number of building permits issued in the three year period
before and after the <span style="font-weight: bold;">split-rate</span>
was put in place. In every instance, the number of building permits
increased significantly after the implementation of this reform. As the
city improves, without the need for subsidies, the land values
gradually increase, thus providing the city with an increasing source
of revenue for public services. With this system, land values maintain
a natural correlation to the overall health of the city. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Land
values do not peak and spike as they do under conditions which promote
land speculation and profiteering. As development stabilizes, land
values also stabilize.</span> Thus it is possible to have a
self-financing city with citizens reaping the full rewards of their
labor and creativity.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The experience with this form of taxation in the 18
municipalities of
Pennsylvania point towards the possibilities of a self-renewing city.
But until we greatly reduce or eliminate the burden of federal income
and payroll taxes and the billions of dollars of wasteful and
inequitable corporate subsidies, we will only have a partial
realization of the promise. Nonetheless, there is much we can learn
from the split-rate tax cities in Pennsylvania, upon several of which
we shall now focus.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Harrisburg</span>, the capital
of
Pennsylvania, provides one of the best examples of the benefits of
shifting taxes away from labor and productive capital and onto land
according to site values.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In 1981 Harrisburg was listed as the second-most distressed city
in the
nation under criteria used by the federal government. A review of the
gains made in effective economic development activities since then has
produced significant results, and the sharp reversal of nearly three
decades of previous serious decline. Beginning with the implementation
of the split-rate property tax and gradually increasing the tax on land
while decreasing the tax on buildings, Harrisburg has sustained an
economic resurgence that has garnered national acclaim. It twice won
the top United States community honor as All-American City, along with
the top state recognition from the state Chamber of Business and
Industry as Outstanding Community in Pennsylvania, all because of
Harrisburg's development initiatives and progress.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As of 2001, the value of taxable real estate was over $2.2
Billion,
versus $212 Million in 1982. Over 26,000 building permits were issued
from 1982 representing over $2.65 Billion in new investment. Even
adjusted for inflation, this is more than for any period since
Harrisburg became a municipality in the year 1791, with most of this
investment undertaken since 1990. There are over 5,500 businesses on
the city tax rolls in 2001 compared to 1,908 in 1981. The number of
vacant structures, over 5,500 in 1982, have been reduced by 85% to less
than 400. The crime rate has dropped 53% and fire rate has been cut by
72%.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[25]</span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed has written several letters to
officials
of other cities telling them that the split-rate tax has been a key to
the remarkable renewal of his city.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The citizens of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allentown</span>,
the
third largest city in Pennsylvania with a population of 105,000, voted
for the land value tax system in 1994 and it was instituted in 1996.
The difference between the land and building rates was expanded in each
of the following four years. Michael Rosenfeld, the executive director
of that city's Redevelopment Authority, says that the benefits of this
tax approach are evident. The value of both new commercial construction
and of new residential construction increased substantially after the
shift to land value taxation. Nearly three out of every four properties
in Allentown saw some sort of tax cut. Today, many of those properties
have new or better buildings on them, stabilizing the tax base to the
point where there has been no need for a tax increase in five years.
The number of building permits in Allentown has increased by 32%
compared to the three-year period before the land value tax reform.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Allentown and Bethlehem are both in eastern Pennsylvania and are
roughly comparable as to size and economy. In that Allentown adopted
this tax approach and Bethlehem did not, there was an opportunity to
compare the two. Allentown's new construction and renovation grew by
82% in dollar value in the three years after it adopted two-rate LVT as
compared to the prior three years. Its new construction and renovation
grew 54% faster than Bethlehem's new construction and renovation
despite the infusion of much federal grant money into Bethlehem (but
not into Allentown) during 1997-99.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[26]</span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>The small cities of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Washington
</span>and
Monessen, both in southwestern Pennsylvania, are roughly comparable as
to size and economy. Monessen has the common form of property tax which
taxes building value significantly more than land value. After
Washington adopted the split-rate tax in 1985, it saw its new
construction and renovation increase by 33% in dollar value following
this tax reform as compared to the prior three years. During the same
time period, Monessen's new construction and renovation decreased by
26%.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[27]</span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Studies comparing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Oil City</span>,
Pennsylvania, which shifted its tax base starting in January 1989, with
Franklin, a comparable neighbor municipality, found that Oil City
experienced a 58.2% increase in new construction and renovation in the
three years after it adopted a two-rate property tax as compared to the
three years before, whereas Franklin experienced a 12.2% decline during
the same time periods.[28]</small><br>
<br>
<small>In 1995, <a href="../auth/Tideman.html">Professor Nicholas Tideman</a>,
the Chairman of the Economics Dept. at Virginia Tech University and his
then-graduate student, Florenz Plassman, now a professor at the
University of Binghamton, N.Y. completed a highly technical, peer
reviewed study of land value taxation in Pennsylvania. To quote from
the conclusion of their study: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"The results say that for all
four
categories of construction, an increase in the effective tax
differential is associated with an increase in the average value per
permit. In the case of residential housing, a 1% increase in the
effective tax differential is associated with a 12% increase in the
average value per unit. From the perspective of economic theory, it is
not at all surprising that when taxes are taken off of buildings,
people build more valuable buildings. But it is nice to see the
numbers."<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[29]</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><a href="../auth/Cord.html">Dr. Steven B. Cord</a>
has done an exhaustive review of 237 studies of land value taxation
from all over the world. In every instance there was an increase in
construction and renovation after the policy was enacted, indicating
that there were previously unmet needs for housing and other living and
working space.<small><span

we choose to utilize land distant from employment, social, and civic
needs while bypassing superior land?

</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sprawl is not just about
the density of land use. In many cities only one half of the land is
devoted to housing and commercial uses while the other half is vacant
or under-improved. Could it be that there are inefficient
requirements built into some public policies? Smart growth should not
be constrained by archaic patterns that impede or misappropriate free
and open urban land usage. Local ordinances and practices within
cities that force accelerated suburban sprawl should be abolished. We
don't need more regulation, we need greater freedom to act
responsibly. Individuals should have the opportunity to decide
whether they want to live in the suburbs or in the city. This should
not be a coerced decision because of a public policy that impedes
growth within the city. Simple tax reform can help to achieve some of
the goals and objectives of smart growth without government
intervention and wasteful subsidies.</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><br>
<br>
<small>One means that has long been available but not brought into
general use is to exempt buildings from the real estate tax and begin
to impose an annual tax on land sites that makes holding land off the
market for speculation a costly proposition. An annual fee on land
should be set near what the land site alone would yield if rented by
the owner to the highest bidder. Think of how this would change the
behavior of land owners. If I owned a parcel of land with a rental
value of $6,000 a year and that was near what the city charged me as
my annual fee, my return on investment as a land speculator would be
greatly reduced. In order to generate positive cash flow I would
either develop the land myself or put it on the market so that
someone else would develop it. At the same time, if my tax rate on
the building I constructed on the land was zero, my incentive is to
construct a building that maximizes my cash flow (i.e., to develop
the parcel to its highest and best use in the market). At minimum,
land prices would stabilize and the increase in land brought onto the
market would be somewhat offset by increased demand. Land prices to
builders would tend to begin to fall over time.</small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
<br>
<small><b>A Strategy for
Economic Development</b>
</small><br>
<small>Economic theory recognizes that when government places taxes on
production and on commerce the net result is a reduction in those
activities. The reason this occurs is that these taxes add to the
cost of production and to the cost of doing business. The ideal
public policy would be to reduce taxes on production and commerce and
raise public revenue from non-distorting revenue sources.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That non-distorting revenue source
is land and natural resources.
The central problem which limits the operational success of the
economy is the failure to procure the public value which is created
by the community. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This value ought to be reserved
for the community to pay for
public improvements. However, this value is to a large extent
diverted into private pockets by speculation in land and natural
resource values. The correct approach is to create a system in which
no-one, except the citizenry as a whole, is rewarded by the
collection of publicly created values.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists can agree that the
economically efficient public
finance system is one in which revenue is drawn from the rent that
people pay for the use of land and natural resources. These payments
do not distort economic activity. Land rent, because it is pure
surplus, could be taken and used for any purpose and there would be
no negative consequences for the allocation of labor and capital, or
in the use of land and natural resources. If this surplus is invested
in needed infrastructure and other public services, it will in turn
increase land values for future public investment.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Public Finance by
Self-Financing</b>
</small><br>
<small>In the public sector, capital investment in infrastructure
projects would no longer be a debt burden, because the projects would
become self-financing. User charges for the public services, when
combined with the rental income created by these projects, would
cover the cost of creating and running a public service.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It was estimated that the BART
transportation system in San
Francisco produced two times more land value than it cost to build.
The public recaptured only a small part of the cost from benefits
provided by land taxes and user fees. Most of the cost came from
external sources, unrelated sales and income taxes. Most of the
profits went into only a few pockets.</small></p>

is short of capital is
misleading .<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span> <a

A Plea to Public Economists</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Fortunately, real-estate

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The empirical fact on the ground
is attracting increasing academic
attention from many fields, including urban studies, legal scholars,
and anthropologists, and there have been international scholarly
conferences to explore private communities (Glasz, 2005).</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The great challenge concerns
existing
communities of the traditional governmental structure: How are they
converted to a nexus of private property and contract?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Robert Nelson (1999) has proposed a policy for converting
neighborhoods
to residential associations, similar to the policy in St. Louis, where
neighborhoods may privatize (Foldvary 1994). Under Nelson&#8217;s plan, state
law would permit property owners to petition to form a neighborhood
association within a proposed boundary. Approval would require an
affirmative vote both of 90 percent of the total property value
affected and 75 percent of the individual unit owners. The relevant
governments would 125 then authorize a transfer of services and
property such as streets to the association, accompanied by tax credits
in compensation for the reduction of government expenses. All property
owners in the privatized neighborhood would be required to be members
of the association and pay assessments. Since they would already have
title to the real estate, there is no financial impediment, as there
would be if they had to buy the land afresh.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Conversion to civic associations would not only partially
privatize
local governance, it would also result in a shift in public finances,
with lower taxes to the city, replaced by association assessments which
would be much closer to geo-rent. The association would get revenue
from payments either equal per member or based on front footage or
property value. The economic ideal would be payments based on geo-rent,
because the rent would most closely reflect the value of the community
services. But even if there is, say, an equal payment by the real
estate owners, if the properties have about the same market value, the
payments would have the effect of tapping geo-rent, with no excess
burden.</small><br>
<br>
<small>My proposal (Foldvary, 1994) for a neighborhood conversion makes
the
membership in private communities strictly voluntary and open to any
real estate owner. Any person or organization having title to land
would be able to partially secede, to withdraw property and services
from governmental jurisdiction, and create its own governance. The
government could require an exit fee or on-going rental payments to
compensate for its services that the private community would still
benefit from. If most of a neighborhood wishes to privatize but some do
not, those wishing to remain directly under the government would
continue to be under government jurisdiction, and there would then be
agreements for the joint provision of services such as streets that
service both members and non-members. While this may result in a more
complicated arrangement than that of Nelson, I believe it is important
to maintain the voluntary nature of civic associations as much as
possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small>

  Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The United States is a federation of states (and Indian-nation reservations),
      with many government functions such as criminal law, education, and local services
      provided by the states. Since the federal income tax was enacted in 1913, taxation
      and authority have shifted increasingly to the federal government.</p>
  <p>In 1902, federal taxes represented 37 percent of total revenue to governments
      at all levels.45 By 2002, federal taxes represented 67 percent of the government
      revenue pie.46 The share taken by state governments rose from 11.4 percent
      in 1902 to 21.5 percent in 1986. Local governments&#8217; share fell from
      51.3 percent in 1902 to 13.7 percent in 1986.</p>
  <p>The change in the share of tax revenues taken by each level of government
      has occurred in large part because of the relative ease of increasing income
      taxes at the federal level, and the relative difficulty of increasing local
      and state taxes. Taxpayers find it much easier to respond to changes in
    state and local taxes, by moving to lower-tax communities. It is far more
    difficult
      to avoid taxes imposed by the federal government &#8212; especially since
      U.S. citizens are taxed even if they are abroad.</p>
  <p>Revenue-sharing from the federal government to the states is, in effect, a
      tax cartel among the states, collusion to tax the population and then divide
      the funds among the states. Taxation at the federal level also encourages spending
      by the federal government instead of the states, so now we have federal departments
      and agencies for education, housing, health and welfare, energy, and other
      fields that once were local, state, or private-sector matters.</p>
  <p>Local and state governments, once willing to go along with the federal government&#8217;s
      tax-and-revenue-sharing scheme, are beginning to realize centralized taxing
      brings with it centralized authority, dramatically reducing local control.
      Revenue-sharing comes with strings attached: Local and state governments
    must abide by federal government mandates in order to obtain the funds, taken
    from
      their residents in the first place. Revenue-sharing allows the federal
    government to sidestep the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides
    that powers
      not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved to the
    people and the states.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation would shift economic power back to state and local governments.
      Land is suited to local taxation because &#8212; unlike enterprise, capital,
      and labor &#8212; it cannot be moved. Land is also the logical source of local
      public finance because it does not burden enterprise, so that entrepreneurs
      don&#8217;t even want to run from it. Indeed, entrepreneurs welcome a shift
      to land value taxation, not only because their economic profits are not
      taxed if all taxation is on land values, but also because land value taxation
      reduces
      the price of land, so they do not need to borrow so much when they invest
      funds in an enterprise.</p>
  <p>When public finance is based on land value taxation, government revenues flow
      up, instead of trickling down from the federal government to the states and
      then to local governments. Real estate taxes today are assessed and collected
      primarily by county governments; under a system of land value taxation, funds
      raised would flow up from the counties to the states, and only then to the
      federal government.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation would create a decentralizing force, shifting or &#8220;devolving&#8221; power
      down to local government in accord with the principle of subsidiarity:
    that which can be most efficiently done by individuals or smaller jurisdictions
      should not be done by larger or higher-level jurisdictions. Government
    functions
      would then come under more observation and control by the voters, who can
    monitor and alter local governments much more easily than remote federal
    agencies.

  <p>      Every community, whatever its political name and extent -- village, city, state
        or province or nation -- has its own normal, unfailing income, growing with
        the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary governmental
        expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes.
In a
market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
four factors of production: </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>the rent of land, </small></li>
  <li><small>the wages of labor, </small></li>
  <li><small>the interest received from owning capital, and </small></li>
  <li><small>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
investments and organizing production). </small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy
must
either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</small></p>
<p><small>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does
so at
the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
market forces.</small></p>
<p><small>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
have the option of moving away. </small></p>
<p><small>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the
rent
of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
for the costs that their actions impose on others.</small></p>
<p><small>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for
revenue
to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
collected publicly without discouraging growth.</small></p>
<p><small>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<small style="font-weight: bold;">... Every activity that is
continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
</small>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Thus the rental value of land is a
natural first source of
financing for local public expenditures.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Making the rental value of
land a principal source of local public
revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.
</span></small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of the rental value
of land is the gift of nature</span>--the fertility
of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second part of the
rental value of land comes from the provision
of public services.</span> The local agencies that provide these
services
can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
results from their activities.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A third part of the
rental value of any particular site arises
from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
site. </span>Social collection of this part of the rental value of
land is
particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
private activities according to how much they increase the rental
value of land.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of
land
has two parts. </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> First, the rental value
of land has the rare quality of being a source of public revenue that
does not discourage productive activity. </span>If people are taxed
according to their labor earnings, they can be expected to work less,
and to tend to move from the places that tax them. If people are taxed
on their investments and savings, they can be expected to save and
invest less, and to find it attractive to put their savings and
investments in other places where they will not be taxed as much. But
when the rental value of land is collected, no one will reduce the
amount of land in existence, and no one will move his land elsewhere.
Thus social collection of the rent of land does not reduce the
productivity of an economy in the way that most other sources of public
revenue do.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second part of the
efficiency argument is that social collection of the rent of land tends
to make land more available to those who want to start new enterprises</span>.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
not collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to
ignore the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better
use of it. </span>On the other hand, if those who have rights to land
are required to make annual payments equal to the market value of the
rights they hold, then these continuing payments will induce people to
ask themselves regularly whether they ought to release the land to
someone who can make better use of it.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>To achieve the potential efficiency of public revenue from
land,
it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
their neighbors are being charged.</small></p>
<p><small>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
passing out titles to the current users of land. </small></p>
<p><small>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
land.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>The
efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small></p>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</small></p>

<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
<p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
features. 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
this feature. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
development. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
its land.</small><a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices
with practical resolutions and synergies</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the state or local level,
George's program is the answer to
California Governor Pete Wilson's dilemma, and every governor's
dilemma: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>it untaxes and attracts capital, and encourages capital
formation, without giving away the store, or untaxing the rich, or
starving the schools and police. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>It raises state revenues from the
richest people while attracting business and wealth with the very
same stroke.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
unique, remarkable quality of a property tax based
on land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land, however high the tax rate. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Not one square foot will walk out
of town. The only bad thing to say
about this tax's incentive effects is that it stimulates
revitalization, and makes jobs.</span> If some people think that is
bad,
maybe they are the problem.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So George's simple program not
only reconciles efficiency and
equity, it squares taxes and incentives.<big style="font-weight: bold;">
... </big></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George's tax program stimulates
both the demand side and the
supply side. Here is the gist of why it works where other methods
fail. <b> A land tax spurs landowners to use land to earn cash to pay
the taxes. A land tax creates pressure on owners to hire and produce
more; other taxes create pressures to hire and produce less.</b> That
works because it is a fixed charge: it cannot be avoided by
underusing land, and it is not increased by using it. It applies
leverage to landowners, just as would a fixed debt service. Leverage
means that a landowner, by raising gross output 20%, for example, may
raise his net income by 100%.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the demand side, to repeat, </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>it makes jobs by removing tax penalties from hiring
workers and creating capital. </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, a land tax creates pressure on owners to hire
more; other taxes create pressures to hire less. </small></li>
  <li><small>Third, untaxing capital and its income raises the
incentive to invest, answering those who still dispute Say's Law. </small></li>
  <li><small>Fourth, tax revenues are spent locally (whereas rents paid
to absentee owners are spent distantly). <strong>...</strong>  </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The taxable capacity of land is
surprisingly high. It has been
concealed conceptually by many sophisms inherent in modern economic
theory, and concealed statistically by rolling land rent into other
categories. A good deal of potential rent has also been aborted by
the counterproductive tax methods used on buildings and labor. This
is a big topic, treated in "<a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The
taxable capacity of land,</a>" and "<a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_HTRaDC.html">How
to revive a dying city</a>," bound herein, and "Adequacy of land as a
tax
base," and "The synergistic city," on reserve.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
great deal of latent rent would be generated by new, full
development. It is not just the individual sites that matter here,
but the synergistic community effects of active renewal and full,
timely development. </span></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The positive neighborhood effects of replacing
old buildings with new are irresistible and contagious, raising land
prices all around. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The converse is also true: the negative
neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand without replacement
are depressive. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, when you take the tax off
new buildings, and
put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick off a general
process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope into optimism:
optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax base. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urban blight is cumulative and
self-reinforcing: blighted
buildings cast a pall on land around them, discourage upkeep and
stifle renewal. Whatever slows renewal of one site therefore slows
the neighborhood, which reflects back blight to the first, a vicious
downward spiral. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Conversely, new buildings help
stimulate renewal around
them.<font size="-2"><small><i>12</i></small></font> The rule is that
new
buildings draw tenants from old and weaken other Defenders so other
owners have to renew, too. When they do, where better than next to
the newest, hottest building? So renewal is cumulative, just like
blight, only upwards in a benign spiral. A benign spiral is a "free
lunch," the kind that cynics say "there ain't no such thing as."<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When a city untaxes buildings its
land prices, the new tax base,
are pushed up. Competition for sites raises the tax base -- not
buildings, now, but land prices derived from ground rents. Using the
higher base the city can improve public services, if needed, but
without taxing any building, without scaring away any generators of
fiscal surpluses. In this scenario, buildings raise the tax base
indirectly, by raising the value of land around them. So do
productive people, when their wages are not taxed away. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land prices are raised just by the
expectation of new buildings'
being tax free. The mere expectation will <i>immediately</i> boost
the value of land, even before the new buildings go up. </small><small><a

whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He keeps repeating we
must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span

people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem. ...
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"Corporate" is not
coterminous with "industrial," anyway.
Many corporations are in retailing. They own chain stores, malls,
gasoline stations, auto dealerships, major real estate
"developments," drive-ins, office space, department stores, banks,
"power centers," etc. As to these, shifting to the land basis will
shift more of the tax burden to them, because retailing has a higher
land fraction than any other major land use (except vacant, golf
courses, cemeteries, parking lots, etc.). <b>That is because location
is more critical to retailers than other businesses. You can tell
this by their high rate of tear-downs and remodeling.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Among its other effects,
site-value taxation will induce
some land to shift from retail to industrial use.</b> Recall that
exempting the building, or prospective building, lets buyers bid more
for land. The higher the building fraction, the stronger is that
force. Thus the present system, which is biased against buildings
generally, is biased against industrial compared with retail uses.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Removing that bias will help industry
outbid retail for land -- not
all land, of course, but land on the tipping point between the uses.
Most towns today seem oversupplied with retailers, compared with
their shortage of basic industries. Shifting to the site-value basis
of property taxation helps redress that balance. ...</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The adequacy of a tax base must
be judged over the cycle of
boom and bust, a cycle we are now learning is still much alive.
</b>How stable is the base? Capital comes and goes; land is fixed.
When they finally close that plant and move the work to Mexico, at
present we reward them by lowering their taxable valuation -- reward
them and punish ourselves, as city revenues fall. On the other hand,
if we taxed just their land, the valuation would remain about the
same. They will squeal, cajole, and threaten, but no way can they
move their land to Mexico. They will just have to find a new use for
it. Meantime, you will have made it more likely there are profitable
new uses by removing the tax threat against whatever new capital they
might invest in your town to employ your people.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> Another attractive feature
of land taxation is its
interesting positive effect on the economic base of a city. It
strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder than
resident owners.</b> The land fraction in real estate is generally
highest in the CBD of any city, so that is a favorite place for
absentees to buy and hold. They like the steady income, and the
"trophy" quality. The surplus in real estate is what attracts outside
buyers, and land is what yields the surplus. <b>About 2/3 of downtown
Los Angeles is owned by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more
workaday city, Milwaukee, the absentee owners consist of former
residents, or their heirs, who grew too rich to abide the harsh
winters.</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your
balance of payments. When you
get more tax money from absentees, money that used to flow to Tehran,
Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows into your local treasury to pay your
local teachers and city workers, and relieve your builders and
building managers. In this way taxing land actually acts to undergird
the value of its own base.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;To stimulate building is
also to uphold and fortify the tax
base, even though you do not tax the new buildings directly. Some
people fault the "depressing" canyons of Manhattan, between the
skyscrapers. In my observation, it is not the canyons that depress
Manhattan. <b>When the GM building went up, Fortune Magazine reported
it doubled the rents of stores across the deep canyon so formed.</b>
Its spillover effects were highly positive. What really depresses
Manhattan are rather the centenarian firetraps and the activities
they attract. They tend to downvalue other lands nearby, eroding the
tax base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect of
floorspace rentals on ground rents
and land values. Doubling floorspace rentals will more than double
land values, through a kind of leverage effect. That is because <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">all
cash flows above a constant amount required for the building will
inure as ground rents.</span> The higgling and arbitrage of the market
will
see to that. Once that constant is met, everything above it goes to
landownership as such, raising land prices which are the land tax
base.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>When you observe cities
much, the positive neighborhood
effects of replacing old buildings with new are irresistible and
contagious, raising land prices all around. The converse is also
true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope
into optimism: optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax
base.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There are three kinds of
slums.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>Type I slums</b> develop on land in the van of downtown
expansion, on land held for a future higher use. The speculators are
milking the old structures for any residual value. They don't much mind
when the tenants leave, and spare them the trouble of an eviction when
they want to sell or rebuild. That's what they're in it for: the
current use is incidental.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Type III slums</b> (listed here out of numerical order)
develop on land that is no good, and may never be, like floodplains and
earthquake faults. They also develop around abbatoirs, dumps,
stockyards, etc., although these are subject to change. In either case,
people are driven there by the inadequate development of good land.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Type II slums</b>, our focus here, are the most
extensive.
They occur on good or superior residential land originally developed
over fifty or a hundred years ago. It may once have housed the upper
crust, but as the buildings aged without replacement they "filtered
down," and down, and down, until their occupants began radiating
negative neighborhood effects. There comes a tipping point where the
neighborhood self- destructs cumulatively, because no one wants to
build new in a decayed, menacing neighborhood. The renewal value of
land is lost, the tax base is lost, nothing remains but social and
public costs: a municipal disaster area. The city that fails to renew
itself on time is steering itself to this fate, like Camden, the Bronx,
East St. Louis, Benton Harbor, MI, and Detroit.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;That's the bad news. How do
you turn it around? When you
drop buildings from the property tax base, you change the arithmetic
of incentives, as we have discussed. Parachuting into the middle of a
slum is still hopeless, as before. Change will come first to the
fringes of the Type II slum, where it merges into healthy
neighborhoods. New development likes to anchor onto healthy
neighborhoods. Richard Hurd, father of urban studies in America,
taught us in 1902 that land values are marked by continuity in space.
It's still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles last.
<b>Hope survives at the edge of the slum; land there retains some
renewal value. There is where you'll first see change, because there
is where the forces are evenly balanced. Tip the forces for renewal,
and there is where it begins.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Once it begins, it
proceeds incrementally through the
Type II slum. When it's through, your oldest neighborhood has become
your newest, the cutting edge of progress, the showplace of the town.
That is how it has got to work; that is how it will work when you
exempt buildings and tax only land. When it is through, you have a
high tax base where now you have nothing but fire and police
calls.</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; .</span>..&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small>

Revive a Dying City</a><small><b><br>
</b></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>George's
Constructive Program</b>
</small><br>
<small>The key to renewing cities is shifting from obstructive ways of
sharing rent, like rent control; and destructive ways, like looting
and subsidies; to constructive ways. Henry George showed us how
equity and efficiency go hand in hand, how the magic of justice
combines with the magic of incentive.
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small>First, by George, equity need not be in
kind. The monetary
mechanism overcomes the clumsiness of in-kind equity. If four
families inherit a one-family house, all four don't crowd in; they
sell and divide the money, or one buys out the others. There is
equity in money as well as in real estate. Money is often better; the
reinvestment opportunity puts the house on a magic carpet to follow
you anywhere. Money is wonderful!</small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>Second, by George, use the tax mechanism.
Do not divide land into
unusable morsels, or shackle the market with rent controls, or
dissipate rent in subsidies. Give land to the highest bidder, and tax
ground rents to support government. </small></li>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Power to Destroy or
to Redeem</b>
</small><br>
<small>But we've always heard that tax destroys incentives. The news in
Henry George is that we can tax all the rent out of land, and not one
square foot will walk away, nor will God switch off the Creation. Man
creates capital by saving; some Other Force created land, and
sustains and serves it every day, undeterred by taxes.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Nor will Georgist taxes leave
owners sulking on their land, but
the contrary. A 1983 <span style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>magazine
article calls them <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Higher
Taxes that Promote Development." The fixed tax is levied on land
value, based on opportunity cost. The owner uses land harder and
improves it more to meet a fixed tax; or sells, releasing surplus
land to those needing more space. <span

they increase with enterprise. Land tax increases only with
opportunity cost, which is independent of the enterprise of the
owner.</span> The only activity this tax impairs is withholding land

need for that: California can show you 17 years of experience. To
read your future, just study our past. Here is what has happened

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The obvious direct results have
been to cut public services, raise
other taxes, and lose credit rating.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>

</strong><br>
<small><b>It should give one pause. It is, however, if you think about
it, the expectable result of what the voters did.</b></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>They turned property from a functional concept into a
sacred one; from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce
goods, and pay taxes into a welfare entitlement. </small></li>
  <li><small>They rejected the concept of a tax on inert wealth in
favor of the rival concept of taxing liquidity and cash flow. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The predictable result is to
inhibit economic activity, and
encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.</small><br>
<br>
<small>David Shulman tersely summarized the distributive effects of
Prop.
13 as he left us for Salomon Brothers in Manhattan: "it breached the
social compact." <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small><b>1/8 of all new businesses started in the U.S. were in
L.A., 1945-50. </b>These were small, creative, flexible, and too
varied to classify. No Linnaeus could sort them in conventional
categories: the new Angelenos simply stayed here and started
producing everything for themselves, some things previously imported,
and others never seen before.<strong>&nbsp; ...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Why is that not happening
today, 1995?</b> An invisible,
pervasive change is <b>Proposition 13</b>, which makes it possible to
hold land at negligible tax cost. In 1945 land was taxed at 3% every
year, building a fire under holdouts to turn their land to use. Today
that same tax cost is well below 1%. Using <b>Gwartney's Rule of
Thumb</b> (see below under B,1), it is about 1/8 of 1%: a rate of 1%
applied to 1/8 of the true value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landowners are only taxed now
if they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they meet the drag of our
high business and employment and sales taxes, necessitated by the
fall of property taxes. A handful of oligopolistic landowners control
most of the market; small businesses are squeezed out. This helps us
segue from being at the cutting edge of industrial progress to a
third-world economy - from the NH model to the AL model - with little
relief in sight. ...
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California displayed amazing
growth up to 1978, and the resilience
to shrug off the loss of war industries after 1945 and still grow
"explosively" (as Jane Jacobs put it). After 1978 we have a string of
reverses. The timing, along with a priori causative analysis, plus
various direct observations too numerous for this time-slot, support
an hypothesis that the reverses were aggravated by Prop. 13.

elected Arnold Schwarzenegger (A.S.) to replace him. A.S. has
revealed no specifics of how he will stanch our deficit. He
campaigned on generalities: he is against taxes, against waste in
government, against measures to rein in vehicle use, and nostalgic
about the good old days when Governor Pat Brown was spending heavily
on roads and water projects. No one seems sure how he will connect
the dots. After his first visit to Sacto last week, he seemed not
sure, either.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>His choice of advisors, however,
tells us A.S. will repeat Pete

spurring job creation and stimulating the economy. It is simple:
restore that part of the property tax that falls on land, while
continuing to cap the rate on buildings.<strong> </strong></span><strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>It is also alleged that land
values are too small to support
government. Let us test that idea.</b> In 2003, at the current
rate, there will be about 15,000 "confirmed" sales of owner-occupied
urban California residences at prices over $1 million. That is from
DataQuick, a standard source of current real estate data. 15,000 is
about 2.7% of all confirmed sales. Some of those go much higher. The
mean is probably over $2 million.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turnover of costlier homes is
lower than that of ordinary homes. (For example, turnover of existing
homes is 30% greater in Riverside
County, with lower values, than in Orange County, with higher
values.) 2% a year is a fair guess at the turnover of homes valued
at $1 million or more. If so, there are 50 x 15,000, or 750,000 homes
in Calif valued at a mean $2 millions. Their aggregate value is
750,000 x $2million = $1.5 trillions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These are not large buildings:
they average 2864 s.f., with 4
bdrms, 3 baths. In the north end of Sta. Monica, a vacant lot alone

land that makes them worth so much.</small></p>

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements.<strong> ... </strong><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>To bolster their local economies and fatten
their tax base, local governments compete to attract large new
employers. Hoping to recoup down the road when businesses pay full
property taxes, elected officials offer such inducements as five-year
abatements and low system development charges. Yet each locality must
outdo others' incentives. Enterprise zones and tax privileges amount to
major subsidies that would otherwise generate substantial tax revenues.<strong>... </strong><br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small><b>PTS Improves the Economy<br>
</b></small></font><b><font size="2"><small><br>
</small></font></b><font size="3"><small>Land that is higher taxed is
lower priced.
Cheaper land reduces buyers' debt. Less demand for loans lowers the
lending rate. Cheaper capital means more investment and more
employment. In Australia, in the province around Melbourne, some towns
levy the regular property tax, others tax only land. Those with the
same rate for sites and structures suffer more bankruptcies; those with
one rate for land enjoy more successful business start-ups.<br>
<br>
<b>
</b>The PTS encourages investing in high-yield use of parcels.
Developing land generates jobs in construction. As those construction
workers spend their incomes, they generate more business for local
merchants. For the few years that New York exempted buildings in the
1920s, the city boomed more than any other US city. In New Zealand,
over 80% of the towns tax land, not buildings. Before the 70's oil
shock hit, they enjoyed over a decade of employment at 99%.<br>
<br>
A stable source of revenue is a virtue in the eyes of any government.
When recession strikes, governments that tax income or property must
borrow more to make ends meet. The disincentives built into ordinary
taxes deepen and prolong the recession. When taxes upon effort are
eased, the economies can recover.<br>
<br>
The PTS can cure local recessions. Spurring building, while not
burdening it, keeps a web of regional suppliers, installers,
architects, financiers, and others in greater demand. In the 17 Western
Australian cities in the Perth area that had shifted to land taxation,
new construction increased by 34% from 1971-76, while nine localities
with ordinary property taxes saw a .02% decrease. From 1974-84, a
period marked by recession in the latter half, towns near Melbourne
that tax land alone saw the number of businesses increase by 11%,
whereas cities without land taxation witnessed a drop of 20% (Cord
1998). Similarly, in the early 1990s, Connellsville and Washington,
Pennsylvania, turned to the PTS; both enjoyed more new construction and
housing (CSE 1997). Such examples illustrate the stable growth
unleashed by the PTS.<strong> ... <br>
</strong><br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>Fiscal conservatives, too, could
find a feature to cheer. The PTS
generally reduces the number of government assessors, arbitrators, and
staff by 40 percent. Computer Aided Mass Appraisal (CAMA) also saves
tax dollars. ... <br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>Rising government costs with
deteriorating government services is
another growing problem claiming our attention. On this issue, tax
shifters can make common cause with those striving to cut bureaucratic
overhead and corporate welfare (as is done by FOE on the national level
in Washington, DC). As people feel overwhelmed by so many seemingly
divergent problems, they seek an analysis -- and prognosis -- that ties
these issues together and applies to them one of Thoreau's chop at the
root -- a role made for the PTS. ... </small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>&nbsp;<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution
which in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">What To Do About the
Real Estate Bubble</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What&#8217;s bubbling, and until when?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Sellers are happy. So are developers and speculators. Real estate has
gone all bubbly, and that bubble has gone ballistic. What goes up,
however, must soon do something else. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Actually, it&#8217;s not housing whose price has entered the
stratosphere. Buildings age &#8211; get older, more worn out. What&#8217;s getting
more valuable is the land, the location &#8211; whether it has a building on
it or not. Buildings you can make more of, but land you can not,
especially locations along the coasts or on the good side of town. None
of that would matter if you could ever get buildings to hover around in
the air. Meanwhile however, speculators are happy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... What&#8217;s seemingly good for landowners is not necessarily good
for the economy. As people spend more on land, something nobody
produced, they spend less on output, things people do produce. As
producers get less money spent on their products, eventually they take
the hint and produce less. "Produce less" is another way of spelling
recession.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Plus, more expensive land means heavier borrowing to buy it.
More debt means more inflation and less stability. When producers cut
back, borrowers have a much harder time paying back their debts. As
people go bankrupt, they drag others down with them. A collapsing house
of cards is another way of spelling depression.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preventing bubbles?</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If land values didn&#8217;t get
inflated, of
course they would not have to get deflated.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Call it mutual compensation for
deprivation from part of our common natural heritage. </span> While in
rhythmic
systems, prices must rise and fall, but they need not boom then bust;
they could climb then glide. What would temper economies, preventing
bubbles? Rather than let a few lucky owners collect land values,
neighbors would have to recover land values for themselves. Nobody made
land, and no lone owner made its value; the presence of society in
general did that. Plus, for excluding everyone else from their sites,
owners owe everyone else, as each one of us owes everyone for excluding
them. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To recover land value,
government
could either transform the property tax into a land tax or replace it
and other taxes with land dues or land use fees or an annual deed fee.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To pay the land
dues, owners use their
land efficiently; owners who had been speculating get busy and develop.</span>
No longer allowed to tax anything that moves, local governments, too,
which presently let acres of abandoned urban land and buildings lie
fallow, get busy, too, and make sure to get those acres into the hands
of ambitious owners who&#8217;ll pay land dues. More locations put to use and
more buildings put up increases supply, which dampens price.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Better still, as government recovers
land rent, that leaves owners with less land rent to capitalize into
land price. Hence buyers need not borrow so much.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Land would still rise in value. With
every discovery of a nearby natural resource. With the opening of every
new bridge. With every techno-advance, as silicon wafers did for
Silicon Valley. With every jump in income and drop in crime, land value
rises. But no longer into a bubble. Because every rise would find its
way &#8211; via land dues and rent dividends &#8211; into everyone&#8217;s pockets. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
If the 18-year average holds for this cycle, then real estate still has
a few more years of sucking all the investments and purchasing power
out of the rest of the economy. Land is still able to soak it all up,
and lenders are still willing to pump more in. So despite the premature
panic (markets almost never do what everybody says they&#8217;re going to
do), Mankiw&#8217;s 2007 would be the earliest that the current bubble would
burst, and 2008 is just as likely.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Then land prices will fall for a few years. Since the run-up was steep,
the drop will be, too &#8211; after correcting for inflation, maybe as much
as 50%. Which will be an enormous relief for the economy &#8211; just what
the doctor ordered. With land affordable again, a new cycle can get
under way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether the new one will
be boom and bust or climb and glide is up to us, whether we&#8217;re willing
to practice geonomics, to forego taxes and subsidies in favor of land
dues and a Citizens Dividend.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While I don&#8217;t mind the current
gambling, I do mind the widening of the cavernous gulf between haves
and have-nots, and I boil over while workweek grows more onerous, and
just seethe watching vacant lots and abandoned buildings push
development out from urban cores to sprawl on suburban farmland. To
reverse that, let&#8217;s let go of the individual owner&#8217;s hold on land rent
and share Earth&#8217;s worth equitably among us all. We&#8217;ll all be glad we
did. </span>...<a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">&nbsp; <big><big><small><small><span

Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a>&nbsp; (circa 1964)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span

technology the actual level of employment and production falls short of
the full use of our manpower and industrial capacity. ...</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The purpose of my talk
is
to show that the relation of property taxation to unemployment and lack
of economic growth is that of cause to effect.</span>...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Ricardo believed that ground rents and the value of land have a
tendency to rise continuously and that this benefits solely the
landowners. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The progress of
industrialization and urbanization in the
second half of the 19th century resulted in a rapid increase in the
value of urban land and the owners of such land reaped tremendous
profits. This led John Stuart Mill to observe, that "Only the
landowners grow richer, as it were in their sleep without working,
risking and economizing". He called for the taxation of land in order
to recapture the unearned increment accruing to the land owners.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The apostle of land taxation is <a href="About_HG.html">Henry
George</a>. In his famous book
<a href="../George_P&P.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span></a> he develops
his single tax theory. He tries to show that poverty and unemployment
and other evils are caused by the land monopolists. Henry George's
theory is similar to that developed by John Stuart Mill. Land values
are based on ground rents which are created by the community and not by
the land owners. Therefore the community is justified in recapturing
these rents by a single tax on land. <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>Three criteria are generally used to judge the merits of a tax. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, it must be satisfactory as a revenue producer, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>second it must be equitable and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>third its economic effects should not collide with the
public
interest. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For instance if full employment
and economic growth are regarded as
desirable, the question to be examined is what effects will this tax
have on achieving these objectives?<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>When analysing property taxes we shall distinguish between that
part of
the tax which is assessed on improvements and that part which is
assessed on land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>That part of the tax that is assessed on buildings penalizes
everybody
who improves his land, his buildings or intends to construct
residential, commercial or industrial property. The most serious
incidence of property taxes is on new housing. When rental property or
houses are newly constructed these taxes add 15 to 20% to the annual
cost depending on assessment practices and tax rates.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The steep increase in the level of rentals represents a true and
accurate yardstick of our housing shortage. During the period 1950 to
1961</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the average rental rose from $71.13 per month to $186.79
or by
160%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>During the same period median urban family income rose
from
$3,497 to $5,924 or by only 69%.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></li>
  <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Construction costs per square foot rose
from $8.68 in 1950 to $11.32 in 1961 or by only 30.4%.</span></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The ever widening gap between
the level of rentals and the urban family income constitutes a rental
squeeze, which has brought untold misery and hardship to families in
the lower income group, especially to those belonging to minority
groups. The rental squeeze has also aggravated overcrowding and slum
conditions.</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">In
the
press, on the radio and on television we are often warned about the
threat of inflation. Hardly ever are we told, that the increase in the
cost of living is to a large extent due to the increase in housing
costs brought about by the housing shortage.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To
the
extent that property taxes discourage residential construction and the
improvement and modernization of homes they create unemployment.</span>
The housing construction industry employed about 2,200,000 people in
1962, that is about 1.4 persons per housing unit. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Any change in the direction of
home building employment is multiplied 2.57 times. </span>Thus an
increase in housing starts by 50% would give employment to 2.8 million
persons. An increase by about 66.6% or by 2/3 would create about 3.6
million jobs. These figures do not take into consideration the
investment in public utilities, streets, schools etc., that would be
required to service these additional housing units.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Under our property tax system wealthy communities with expensive
homes
or with heavy concentration of industry will have a large tax basis and
low tax rates. Schools will be good and public services will be
adequate. Yet in a poor community the tax base will be much smaller,
tax rates will be much higher and still it will be found impossible to
provide for good schools and adequate public services.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In a pamphlet entitled <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Paying for better
schools</span> the Committee for Economic Development came to the
conclusion that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"where a
child happens to live is likely to be important in determining the
quality of his education. In some areas children are taught by meagerly
qualified teachers in substandard schools with inadequate equipment.
The school session is shorter and the school leaving age is lower than
the national average."</span></small><br
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A
defect
of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small>This characteristic of the property tax is obscured by the
rising
trends of land values, which in many cases offset the loss in value of
the improvement. Increases in tax rates and differences in assessment
procedures and practices further hide the fact that ad valorem taxes
favor obsolete real property.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let us now turn to that part of
the
tax that is assessed on land. </span>Increases in population,
immigration from the farms and other forces have led to a rapid
increase in the population of our large cities and metropolitan areas. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Population
pressure is bound to increase the value of urban land. Yet an adequate
system of land taxation could have prevented the steep rise in urban
land values.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are
capitalized. For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have
an imputed or expected income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of
capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad valorem" tax would reduce the
imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax would naturally reduce the
value of the land by the same percentage.</small><br>
<br>
<small>For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by
taxing land at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have
increased tremendously during recent years. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For instance in Los Angeles county the
assessed value of land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002
millions in 1962, an increase of a little over 100%. </span>The
assessed values, are supposed to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the unearned increment in land values
during this period amounted to not less than $8 billions.</span> Even
this figure is an understatement because it is based on assessed values
and land is greatly underassessed. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While land
values have risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land
averaged about 1.5%. Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land
would have earned about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from
its proper use.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>A higher tax on vacant or unimproved land would make it
unprofitable to
hold such lands. It will tax land into better use and it will lead to a
spurt in construction activity. While all other taxes are deterrents to
employment and economic growth, though to a varying extent, land taxes
are the only genuine incentive taxes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inflated land values must
necessarily
increase the cost of new homes, the cost of home-ownership and rentals.</span>
It discourages residential construction, prices many families out of
the housing market and aggravates the housing shortage.<strong> ... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>Homeowners who bought their homes some time in the past can reap
large
profits when selling them. Old homes should sell at a lower price,
because of the depreciation of the building, but in most cases the
depreciation of the building is more than offset by the increased value
of the lot. This increased value forces buyers to increase their down
payments or to increase their loan are higher, many families are priced
out of the market.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We have discussed the sharp increase in the level of rents that
has
taken place during these last years. These increases reflect the steep
rise in land values that have taken place in almost all sections of our
cities. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
tax assessed on the improvements has discouraged the construction of
more and better housing. At the same time, the tax assessed on land has
been too low to induce owners to sell, improve, or replace their rental
properties.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Property taxes shape the pattern of our cities. </small><br>
The inflationary
effects of property taxation are reinforced by the fact that property
taxes themselves are included in the cost of living index and that
property tax rates have the tendency to rise.</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>If taxes on improvements are low or non-existing and taxes
on
land are high, the cities are bound to grow vertically and at a fast
rate. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>If taxes on improvements are high and taxes on land are
low, our
cities will spread over larger and larger areas. They will become
metropolitan areas and they will grow at a much slower rate.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Relatively low taxes on land and
high taxes on improvements will
discourage the owners of vacant lots or underdeveloped land, such as
that used for parking lots, gas stations, hamburger stands, etc., from
improving their land. It will encourage them to keep the land out of
use and to sell later at a profit. This will create an artificial
shortage of land, which in turn will lead to urban blight and
irregular, leapfrog city growth.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This urban sprawl makes our cities look ugly, but it has many
disadvantages besides: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It gobbles up a tremendous amount of farm land; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the farmers have to give up their land before it is really
needed; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the building developer has to go far out to find available
land; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the prospective home-owner has to travel farther; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>traffic on congested roads will increase and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>new roads and schools will have to be built.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
is generally believed that zoning
laws are a very effective tool to control the growth of our cities.
Zoning laws determine the best possible use of urban land. Yet nobody
can be forced to improve his land and to build unless there is an
incentive. This can be achieved by taxing land at a rate that will make
it unprofitable to hold it without improving it.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>The city planner needs land taxation just as he needs zoning
laws. With
both these tools the orderly growth of our cities will be assured, but
-- as experience has shown -- without land taxation rational and
efficient land usage becomes impossible.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Professor Galbraith and others have expressed concern about the
poverty
of the public sector of our economy as compared to the affluence of the
private sector. The appearance of our cities, the inadequate financial
support we give our schools and poor public services seem to support
this view. Yet, I can not agree with Professor Galbraith's conclusion
that we need more public revenues to meet these needs. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It seems to me that the spreading out of
our cities over wider and wider metropolitan areas has immeasurably
increased the financial burden of local governments. In other words,
wasteful use of land caused by our property tax system is the real
reason of the poverty of the public sector.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>It stands to reason that the spreading out of our cities into
wider and
wider metropolitan areas is a very costly venture. For instance it was
found that in the New York region suburbs have to make capital outlays
of $68 per capita for new housing, while only $44 was required for new
housing in the central cities and only $38 in the non-metropolitan
area. Another survey found that it costs $80 per household to provide
water in the outlying suburbs against $30 in the city.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The administration of the property tax leaves very much to be
desired.
Assessment procedures and practices are in many cases erroneous,
arbitrary and widely variant. So is the ratio of assessed value to full
market or cash value. In many states no public records are available
indicating assessed values and the taxpayer has no of knowing what his
tax bill will be.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The most serious defect in the
administration of property taxation is the continuous, widespread and
enormous underassessment of land. A survey made recently found that in
9 California counties, vacant lots and acreage were assessed at only
5.3% of the cash value, while residential property was assessed at
19.3% of its value. The illegal underassessment of land deprives local
governments of millions of dollars of revenues. Moreover, it further
aggravates the serious defects of property taxation.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on
improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not
identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
paradox of property taxation
consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
improvements produce the same results as lower rates on land.</span>&nbsp;

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>5. Adapting to
the changing nature of inter-urban and inter-regional competition.
</b>Georgist policies had a good run at the local level in the days
when cities sought to grow by attracting population. New York City,
Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Houston, San Diego,
San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, and many
smaller cities all had their periods of rapid population growth with
Georgist-leaning leadership (Gaffney, 2001). Federal income tax
policies have stifled that. <span style="font-weight: bold;">By
loading the Federal tax burden on
labor, while sparing capital, Congress creates a universal bias for
cities and counties to see purely proletarian labor as a &#8220;fiscal
deficit generator,&#8221; a parasite to repel, while capital and
housing for the rich generate local fiscal surpluses. </span>The
resulting
local biases toward selective growth policies are well known, but
most advocates of housing for the poor are merely hacking at the
branches of evil, ignoring the roots in Federal tax policies.</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
<br>
<small><b> Territorial
expansion:</b> Regional cross-subsidy, with subeconomic extension of
public works and services. George&#8217;s critique of land speculation
came to be focused on
&#8220;<b>Speculator Type
#1</b>,&#8221; who withholds good lands from timely use. Georgists
have neglected to condemn the counterpart
&#8220;<b>Speculator Type
#2</b>,&#8221; who acquires marginal lands cheaply, and then lobbies
public agencies to extend roads, utilities, military and police
protection, and other public services to them, below cost. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some Georgists may even see this
as a legitimate way, and an
easier way, to combat the artificial scarcity of land that Speculator
Type #1 causes &#8211; a way of perpetuating the &#8220;frontier
safety-valve.&#8221; However, it unbalances development severely: too
much roading, et al., too little use of the land thus &#8220;opened
up.&#8221; Some taxpayer must pay for the roading et al. If the taxes
are activity-based or improvement-based (i.e. anything but land
taxes) they will sterilize marginal land, and lower the intensity of
use of all land. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a pervasive, immanent bias
in most of our institutions,
from city departments of public works up through state and provincial
public utilities commissions and highway departments, clear to the
Pentagon, World Bank, and CIA. Types #1 and #2, in tandem, create our
form of Imperialism, that perpetual quest for Lebensraum that is our
curse. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In my political experiences, one
collects more cuts and bruises
combating Speculators Type #2 than Type #1. I was, for example, able
to lead the local countywide campaign against Howard Jarvis&#8217;
&#8220;Proposition 13&#8221; without being seriously punished, but a
few years later when I led the campaign against southern
California&#8217;s favorite public water-works boondoggle, the
&#8220;Peripheral Canal,&#8221; my academic and professional world
collapsed about me. Earlier, when I joined the furor against American
imperialism (Gaffney, 1971) and the myth of infinite natural
resources (Gaffney, 1972), I became persona non grata at Resources
for the Future, Inc., where I then worked. In British Columbia, 1975,
I learned that the self-styled &#8220;socialist&#8221; government under
Premier David Barrett was unwilling even to consider withdrawing any
of its expensive cross-subsidies to speculators Type #2, and resented
me for raising the issue. The moose-pastures of northern B.C.
&#8220;are a mighty empire,&#8221; they told me, and the rich retirees
on the Gulf Islands are important constituents who should have both
their subsidized ferry service and their exclusionary zoning to keep
hoi polloi from sharing it. I have war stories, but the objective
point is that the socio-political bias for territorial expansion is
even stronger than the bias against cultivating, intensifying and
renewing our internal frontiers. The Georgist dream of taxing central
rents to finance public services becomes a nightmare when the public
money is dissipated in enriching Speculators Type #2. This kind of
spending not only dissipates rents, and wastes capital, at the same
time it despoils the environment. Worst of all, as the subeconomic
land development proceeds, each new settlement makes a platform for
the next, so there is no end to it short of the limits of capital and
of Earth. It is perhaps fortunate for Earth that, historically, the
limits of capital have been reached first, at the ends of bursts of
territorial overexpansion. ... <a

<p>Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">The
Taxable Surplus of Land: Measuring, Guarding and Gathering It</a>&nbsp; (for
the Duma Hearings in Moscow, 1999)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
  In arid lands, water is life, and the
  most valuable
  natural resource is water. </span>For
  example, in southern California we need water so much we
  import it from the
  Feather River 600 miles north of us, pump it uphill
  through the long San Joaquin
  Valley, then over the high Tehachapi Mountain range, and
  tunnel it through the
  San Bernardino Mountain Range, all at great cost. When it
  gets here, it
  supplements and competes with local water that nature
  provides freely in the
  Santa Ana, San Jacinto, and other rivers. That local water
  then has a value equal
  to the high cost of importing the remote northern water.
  That value in the local
  waters is a taxable surplus. However, we have not learned
  to take that surplus
  value into the local treasuries; we give the water away,
  and worse, we actually
  subsidize people to withdraw water by helping them pay for
  dams, canals, and
  pipelines so they can waste water without paying for it.
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus we turn a public
  asset into a public liability - an extreme form of folly
  that is called "dissipating
  rent."</span> In this age of growing water scarcities it is past
  time we learned to husband
  and nurture rent, in order to socialize it by taxing the
  surplus. So should you, in
  comparable circumstances. ...</small></p>
  <p>... The taxable surplus available from taxing the Net Product of land goes
    on forever, and grows as land rents grow. It is not like the false "revenue" that
    comes from privatizing land, which the IMF et al. would have you do. Selling
    the title to land gives money to the government currently in power, which
    this government is prone to treat as current income and spend right away:
    but it is not permanent income, any more than you would call it income when
    you sell your farm or home. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">To have income, permanent income, you must
    reserve the right to tax land forever, and use that income for public purposes
  or social dividends. </span></p>
  <p>If you think you need cash immediately, in excess of current taxable surplus,
    you can always borrow on the security of the tax revenue you have reserved
    for your government. There are certain dangers in mortgaging your public
    revenues like that, and I would counsel prudence and caution; but these dangers
    are small and uncertain compared with the certain disaster that will follow
    if you sell land forever, without
reserving any power to tax it in the future. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
The U.S.A. fell into this trap in the 19th Century. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Federal Government supported itself
for years by selling off its vast public domain, a domain so vast that generations
of politicians came and went who thought of these sales revenues as a kind of
income.</span> After a while, though, the land was all gone. Then we had to turn
to excise taxes, and income taxes, which have now grown so high they will slowly
strangle us. Those of us who foresee this danger now look to you, Russia, with
your vast undeveloped resources in public ownership, to avoid our errors and
become, as we once fancied ourselves, the "last best hope of earth." We look
to you to convert your nation from its status as a wretched colony from which
people would escape, to a refuge of new opportunity for your own people, and
for the "huddled masses, yearning to breathe free" of
the whole world. ...&nbsp;<small><small> <font style="font-weight: bold;"><small><a
