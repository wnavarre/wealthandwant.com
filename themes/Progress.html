    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 5: The Basic
    Cause of Poverty</a> (in the unabridged: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Book
    V: The Problem Solved</a>) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought
    this question:</p>
  <p>&quot;Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German
    Ocean a no man's land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should
    be able
      to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and
    of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large a part of
    English
      soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
  <p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
      to thirty shillings a day.</p>
  <p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
      would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall; and
    if he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would happen
    without
      any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural
    opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry being much changed;
    only that kind of
      production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together
      less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in
    wages would be at the expense of rent.</p>
  <p>Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
      has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: <strong>&quot;Here is a little
      village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the railroad
      will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light of the candle;
      it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply
      the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be any higher?&quot;</strong></p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for
      a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
      on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not
    be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances
    are
      that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold
      possession.&quot;</p>
  <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing
      more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni
      of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole
      in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota
      to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city
      you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an
      almshouse. ...</p>
  <p>For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which he must draw
      for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for
    the supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be
    taken,
      the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized,
    without the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it
    we live,
      to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
      of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
      to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. <strong>Material progress cannot
      rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing
      wealth from
      land; and hence, when land is monopolized, it might go on to infinity without
      increasing wages or improving the condition of those who have but their labor.
      It can but add to the value of land and the power which its possession gives. </strong>Everywhere,
      in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is the base of aristocracy,
      the foundation of great fortunes, the source of power. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    11 Effect of Remedy Upon the Sharing of Wealth</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
    IX Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: Of the Effect Upon Distribution
    and Thence Upon Production</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all public
      burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated until we
      consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
  <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
      in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
      inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
      as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands, gives
      a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced by labor and
      capital.</p>
  <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
      and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
      this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
      the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed. Rent,
      instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality. Labor and
      capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the
      state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
      would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
  <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided into
      two portions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
          producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;</li>
    <li> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
          in public benefits to all its members.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young children
      and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as well as the vigorous.
      And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents the result of individual
      effort in production, the other represents the increased power with which
      the community as a whole aids the individual.</p>
  <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by the
      community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce inequality
      as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater and greater
      equality. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/11_Effects_upon_Sharing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

  <p>To remove want and the fear of want, to give to all classes leisure, and

      life seemed banned would ere long be dappled with the shade of trees and
    musical with the song of birds. Talents now hidden, virtues unsuspected,

    14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
    X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
      is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
      of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
      and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
      the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
  <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. <strong>It shows that the
        evils arising from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are
        becoming more
      and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, <em>are not incidents of
      progress,
      but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt</em>; that they will not cure
      themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
      greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
      previous civilization has trod. </strong>But it also shows that these evils are not
      imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
      which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
      an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
  <p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men, and
      all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
      In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely
    offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice &#8212; for,
    so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems
    to be
      the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and
    asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform
    ourselves
      to the law &#8212; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution
          of wealth and power; </li>
    <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
    <li>tame the ruthless passions of greed; </li>
    <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
    <li>light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; </li>
    <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse to discovery; </li>
    <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
    <li>make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men are
      created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot; ...</p>
  <p>We honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her statues and sound her
      praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so grow her
      demands. She will have no half service!</p>
  <p>Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings.
      For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the law
      of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation.</p>
  <p>They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission when she has
      abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot, who think of
    her as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of life, have
    not seen
      her real grandeur &#8212; to them the poets who have sung of her must seem
      rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun is the lord of life, as
      well as of light; as his beams not merely pierce the clouds, but support
      all growth,
      supply all motion, and call forth from what would otherwise be a cold and
      inert mass all the infinite diversities of being and beauty, so is liberty
      to mankind.
      It is not for an abstraction that men have toiled and died; that in every
      age the witnesses of Liberty have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty
      have
      suffered.</p>
  <p>We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge, invention,
      national strength, and national independence as other things. But, of all these,
      Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary condition. ...</p>
  <p>Only in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet beamed
      among men, but all progress hath she called forth. ...</p>
  <p>Shall we not trust her?</p>
  <p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
      inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower. <strong>Liberty
      calls to us again. We must follow her further; we must trust her fully. Either
      we must wholly accept her or she will not stay. It is not enough that men should
      vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before the law.
      They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means of
      life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature.
      Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light!</strong> Either this, or darkness comes
      on, and the very forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that work
      destruction. This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries.
      Unless its foundations be laid in justice the social structure cannot stand.</p>
  <p><strong>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing
        one man to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have
        made them
      his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on.</strong> This
      is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
      the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
      is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has
      been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom,
      and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
  <p>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse. It
      is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
      houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
      them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
      that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
  <p>Civilization so based cannot continue. The eternal laws of the universe
    forbid it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness that is in every
    soul answers,
      that it cannot be. It is something grander than Benevolence, something
    more august than Charity &#8212; it is Justice herself that demands of us to right
      this wrong. Justice that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice
      that with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies
      and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches
      when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep?</p>
  <p><strong>Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that attributes
        to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and brutishness that
        come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the All-Father and lays
        on Him the responsibility for the want and crime of our great cities. </strong>We
        degrade the Everlasting. We slander the Just One. A merciful man would
        have better ordered the world; a just man would crush with his foot such
        an ulcerous
        ant-hill! It is not the Almighty, but we who are responsible for the
        vice and misery that fester amid our civilization. The Creator showers
        upon us
        his gifts &#8212; more than enough for all. But like swine scrambling for
        food, we tread them in the mire &#8212; tread them in the mire, while
        we tear and rend each other!</p>
  <p><strong>In the very centers of our civilization today are want and suffering
        enough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his eyes and steel his
        nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to relieve it?</strong> Supposing
        the prayer were heard, and at the behest with which the universe sprang into
        being there should glow in the sun a greater power; new virtue fill the air;
        fresh vigor the soil; that for every blade of grass that now grows two should
        spring up, and the seed that now increases fiftyfold should increase a hundredfold!
        Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever benefit
        would accrue would be but temporary. The new powers streaming through the
        material universe could be utilized only through land.</p>
  <p>This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a fact of experience. <strong>We
        know it because we have seen it. </strong>Within our own times, under our
        very eyes, that Power which is above all, and in all, and through all; that
        Power of which the whole universe is but the manifestation; that Power which
        maketh all things, and without which is not anything made that is made, has
        increased the bounty which men may enjoy, as truly as though the fertility
        of nature had been increased. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Into the mind of one came the thought that harnessed steam for the service
          of mankind. </li>
    <li>To the inner ear of another was whispered the secret that compels the
      lightning to bear a message round the globe. </li>
    <li>In every direction have the laws of matter been revealed; </li>
    <li>in every department of industry have arisen arms of iron and fingers
      of steel, whose effect upon the production of wealth has been precisely
      the
          same as an increase in the fertility of nature. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What has been the result? Simply that landowners get all the gain.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Can it be that the gifts of the Creator may be thus misappropriated
        with impunity? Is it a light thing that labor should be robbed of its earnings
        while greed rolls in wealth &#8212; that the many should want while the few
        are surfeited? </strong>Turn to history, and on every page may be read
        the lesson that such wrong never goes unpunished; that the Nemesis that
        follows
        injustice never falters nor sleeps! Look around today. Can this state
        of things continue? May we even say, &quot;After us the deluge!&quot; Nay;
        the pillars of the State are trembling even now, and the very foundations
        of
        society begin to quiver with pent-up forces that glow underneath. The
        struggle that must either revivify, or convulse in ruin, is near at hand,
        if it be
        not already begun.</p>
  <p>The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers born
      of progress, forces have entered the world that will either compel us to a
      higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as civilization after
      civilization, have been overwhelmed before. ... </p>
  <ul>
    <li> We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and then
          refusing them the right to earn an honest living.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then denying

  The Problem</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The present century has been marked by a prodigious increase in wealth-producing
    power. The utilization of steam and electricity, the introduction of improved
    processes and labor-saving machinery, the greater subdivision and grander scale
    of production, the wonderful facilitation of exchanges, have multiplied enormously
    the
  effectiveness of labor.</p>
  <p>At the beginning of this marvelous era it was natural to expect, and it was
    expected, that labor-saving inventions would lighten the toil and improve the
    condition of the laborer; that the enormous increase in the power of producing
    wealth would make real poverty a thing of the past.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Could a man of the last century--a Franklin or a Priestley--have seen,
          in a vision of the future, the steamship taking the place of the sailing
          vessel, the railroad train of the wagon, the reaping machine of the
      scythe, the threshing machine of the flail;</li>
    <li>could he have heard the throb of the engines that in obedience to human
          will, and for the satisfaction of human desire, exert a power greater
      than that of all the men and all the beasts of burden of the earth combined;</li>
    <li>could he have seen the forest tree transformed into finished lumber--into
          doors, sashes, blinds, boxes or barrels, with hardly the touch of a
      human hand; the great workshops where boots and shoes are turned out by
      the case
          with less labor than the old-fashioned cobbler could have put on a
      sole; the factories where, under the eye of a girl, cotton becomes cloth
      faster
          than hundreds of stalwart weavers could have turned it out with their
      hand-looms;</li>
    <li>could he have seen steam hammers shaping mammoth shafts and mighty anchors,
          and delicate machinery making tiny watches; the diamond drill cutting
      through the heart of the rocks, and coal oil sparing the whale;</li>
    <li>could he have realized the enormous saving of labor resulting from improved
          facilities of exchange and communication--sheep killed in Australia
      eaten fresh in England and the order given by the London banker in the
      afternoon
          executed in San Francisco in the morning of the same day;</li>
    <li><B><I>could he have conceived of the hundred thousand improvements which
              these only suggest, what would he have inferred as to the social condition
              of mankind?</I></B></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It would not have seemed like an inference; further than the vision went,
    it would have seemed as though he saw; and his heart would have leaped and
    his nerves would have thrilled, as one who from a height beholds just ahead
    of the thirst-stricken caravan the living gleam of rustling woods and the glint
    of laughing waters. Plainly, in the sight of the imagination, he would have
    beheld these new forces elevating society from its very foundations, lifting
    the very poorest above the possibility of want, exempting the very lowest from
    anxiety for the material needs of life; he would have seen these slaves of
    the lamp of knowledge taking on themselves the traditional curse, these muscles
    of iron and sinews of steel making the poorest laborer's life a holiday, in
    which every high quality and noble impulse could have scope to grow.</p>
  <p>And out of these bounteous material conditions he would have seen arising,
    as necessary sequences, moral conditions realizing the golden age of which
    mankind have always dreamed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Youth no longer stunted and starved;</li>
    <li>age no longer harried by avarice;</li>
    <li>the child at play with the tiger;</li>
    <li>the man with the muck-rake drinking in the glory of the stars!</li>
    <li>Foul things fled, fierce things tame;</li>
    <li>discord turned to harmony!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For how could there be greed where all had enough? How could the vice, the
    crime, the ignorance, the brutality, that spring from poverty and the fear
    of poverty, exist where poverty had vanished? Who should crouch where all were
    freemen; who oppress where all were peers?</p>
  <p>More or less vague or clear, these have been the hopes, these the dreams born
    of the improvements which give this wonderful century its preeminence. They
    have sunk so deeply into the popular mind as to radically change the currents
    of thought, to recast creeds and displace the most fundamental conceptions.
    The haunting visions of higher possibilities have not merely gathered splendor
    and vividness, but their direction has changed--instead of seeing behind the
    faint tinges of an expiring sunset, all the glory of the daybreak has decked
    the skies before.</p>
  <p>It is true that disappointment has followed disappointment, and that discovery
    upon discovery, and invention after invention, have neither lessened the toil
    of those who most need respite, nor brought plenty to the poor. But there have
    been so many things to which it seemed this failure could be laid, that up
    to our time the new faith has hardly weakened. We have better appreciated the
    difficulties to be overcome; but not the less trusted that the tendency of
    the times was to overcome them.</p>
  <p>Now, however, we are coming into collision with facts which there can be no
    mistaking. From all parts of the civilized world come complaints;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>of industrial depression;</li>
    <li>of labor condemned to involuntary idleness;</li>
    <li>of capital massed and wasting;</li>
    <li>of pecuniary distress among business men;</li>
    <li>of want and suffering and anxiety among the working classes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All the dull, deadening pain, all the keen, maddening anguish, that to great
    masses of men are involved in the words "hard times," afflict the world today. <B>This
    state of things, common to communities differing so widely in situation, in
    political institutions, in fiscal and financial systems, in density of population
    and in social organization can hardly be accounted for by local causes.</B></p>
  <ul>
    <li>There is distress where large standing armies are maintained, but there
          is also distress where the standing armies are nominal;</li>
    <li>there is distress where protective tariffs stupidly and wastefully hamper
          trade, but there is also distress where trade is nearly free;</li>
    <li>there is distress where autocratic government yet prevails, but there
      is also distress where political power is wholly in the hands of the people;</li>
    <li>in countries where paper is money, and</li>
    <li>in countries where gold and silver are the only currency.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Evidently, beneath all such things as these, we must infer a common cause.</p>
  <p><B>That there is a common cause, and that it is either what we call material
        progress or something closely connected with material progress, becomes more
        than an inference when it is noted that the phenomena we class together and
        speak of as industrial depression, are but intensifications of phenomena
        which always accompany material progress, and which show themselves more
        clearly and strongly as material progress goes on. </B><I>Where the conditions
        to which material progress everywhere tends are most fully realized--that
        is to say, where population is densest, wealth greatest, and the machinery
        of production and exchange most highly developed--we find the deepest poverty,
        the sharpest struggle for existence, and the most enforced idleness.</I></p>
  <p>It is to the newer countries--that is, to the countries where material progress
    is yet in its earlier stages--that laborers emigrate in search of higher wages,
    and capital flows in search of higher interest. It is in the older countries--that
    is to say, the countries where material progress has reached later stages--that
    widespread destitution is found in the midst of the greatest abundance. Go
    into one of the new communities where Anglo-Saxon vigor is just beginning the
    race of progress;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>where the machinery of production and exchange is yet rude and inefficient;</li>
    <li>where the increment of wealth is not yet great enough to enable any class
          to live in ease and luxury;</li>
    <li>where the best house is but a cabin of logs or a cloth and paper shanty,
          and the richest man is forced to daily work</li>
  </ul>
  <p>and though you will find an absence of wealth and all its concomitants, you
    will find no beggars. There is no luxury, but there is no destitution. No one
    makes an easy living, nor a very good living; but every one can make a living,
    and no one able and willing to work is oppressed by the fear of want.</p>
  <p><B>But just as such a community realizes the conditions which all civilized
      communities are striving for, and advances in the scale of material progress--just
      as closer settlement and a more intimate connection with the rest of the
      world, and greater utilization of labor-saving machinery, make possible
      greater economies in production and exchange, and wealth in consequence
      increases,
      not merely in the aggregate, but in proportion to population &#8212; <I>so
      does poverty take a darker aspect</I>.</B> Some get an infinitely better
      and easier living, but others find it hard to get a living at. The "<strong>tramp</strong>" comes
      with the locomotive, and alms houses and prisons areas surely the marks
      of "material
      progress" as are costly dwellings, rich warehouses, and magnificent churches.
      Upon streets lighted with gas and controlled by uniformed policemen, beggars
      wait for the passer-by, and in the shadow of college, and library, and
      museum, are gathering the more hideous Huns and fiercer Vandals of whom
      Macaulay
      prophesied.</p>
  <p><B>This fact &#8212; the great fact that poverty and all its concomitants
      show themselves in communities just as they develop into the conditions
      towards which material
        progress tends--proves that the social difficulties existing wherever
      a certain stage of progress has been reached, do not arise from local circumstances,
        but are, in some way or another, engendered by progress itself.</B></p>
  <p>And, unpleasant as it may be to admit it, it is at last becoming evident that <B>the
      enormous increase in productive power which has marked the present century
      and is still going on with accelerating ratio, has no tendency to extirpate
      poverty or to lighten the burdens of those compelled to toil.</B> It simply
      widens the gulf between <A HREF="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/d/i/diveslaz.htm">Dives
      and Lazarus</A>, and makes the struggle for existence more intense. The march
      of invention has clothed mankind with powers of which a century ago the boldest
      imagination could not have dreamed. But</p>
  <ul>
    <li>in factories where labor-saving machinery has reached its most wonderful
          development, little children are at work;</li>
    <li>wherever the new forces are anything like fully utilized, large classes
          are maintained by charity or live on the verge of recourse to it;</li>
    <li>amid the greatest accumulations of wealth, men die of starvation, and
      puny infant suckle dry breasts;</li>
    <li>while everywhere the greed of gain, the worship of wealth, shows the
      force of the fear of want.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The promised land flies before us like the mirage. The fruit of the tree of
    knowledge turn as we grasp them to apples of Sodom that crumble at the touch.</p>
  <p>It is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the average of
    comfort, leisure, and refinement has been raised; but these gains are not general. <A NAME="In them the lowest class do not"></A>In
    them the lowest class do not share.* I do not mean that the condition of the
    lowest class has nowhere nor in anything been improved; but that there is nowhere
    any improvement which can be credited to increased productive power. <B>I mean
    that the tendency of what we call material progress is in no wise to improve
    the condition of the lowest class in the essentials of healthy, happy human
    life.</B> Nay, more, that it is to still further depress the condition of the
    lowest class. <B>The new forces, elevating in their nature though they be,
    do not act upon the social fabric from underneath, as was for a long time hoped
    and believed, but strike it at a point intermediate between top and bottom.</B> It
    is as though an immense wedge were being forced, not underneath society, but
    through society. Those who are above the point of separation are elevated,
    but those who are below are crushed down.</p>

              the necessaries of life is not increased. The beggar in a great city may
              enjoy many things from which the backwoods farmer is debarred, but that

    <p>This depressing effect is not generally realized, for it is not apparent where
    there has long existed a class just able to live. Where the lowest class barely
    lives, as has been the case for a long time in many parts of Europe, it is
    impossible for it to get any lower, for the next lowest step is out of existence,
    and no tendency to further depression can readily show itself. <B>But in the
    progress of new settlements to the conditions of older communities it may clearly
    be seen that material progress does not merely fail to relieve poverty--it
    actually produces it. In the United States it is clear that squalor and misery,
    and the vices and crimes that spring from them, everywhere increase as the
    village grows to the city, and the march of development brings the advantages
    of the improved methods of production and exchange.</B> It is in the older
    and richer sections of the Union that pauperism and distress among the working
    classes are becoming most painfully apparent. <I>If there is less deep poverty
    in San Francisco than in New York, is it not because San Francisco is yet behind
    New York in all that both cities are striving for? When San Francisco reaches
    the point where New York now is, who can doubt that there will also be ragged
    and barefooted children on her streets?</I></p>
    <p><B>This association of poverty
      with progress is the great enigma of our times</B>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is the central fact from which spring industrial, social, and political
          difficulties that perplex the world, and with which statesmanship and
        philanthropy and education grapple in vain.</li>
      <li>From it come the clouds that overhang the future of the most progressive
          and self-reliant nations.</li>
      <li>It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to our civilization,
        and which not to answer is to be destroyed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><B>So long as all the increased wealth which modern progress brings goes but
      to build up great fortunes, to increase luxury and make sharper the contrast
      between the House of Have and the House of Want, progress is not real and
      cannot be permanent.</B> The reaction must come. The tower leans from its
      foundations, and every new story but hastens the final catastrophe. To educate
      men who must be condemned to poverty, is but to make them restive; to base
      on a state of most glaring social inequality political institutions under
      which men are not fully equal, is to stand a pyramid on its apex.</p>
    <p>All-important as this question is, pressing itself from every quarter painfully
    upon attention, it has not yet received a solution which accounts for all the
    facts and points to any clear and simple remedy. This is shown by the widely
    varying attempts to account for the prevailing depression. They exhibit not
    merely a divergence between vulgar notions and scientific theories, but also
    show that the concurrence which should exist between those who avow the same
    general theories breaks up upon practical questions into an anarchy of opinion.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upon high economic authority we have been told that the prevailing
        depression is due to over-consumption;</li>
      <li>upon equally high authority, that it is due to over-production; while</li>
      <li>the wastes of war,</li>
      <li>the extension of railroads,</li>
      <li>the attempts of workmen to keep up wages,</li>
      <li>the demonetization of silver,</li>
      <li>the issues of paper money,</li>
      <li>the increase of labor-saving machinery,</li>
      <li>the opening of shorter avenues to trade, etc., etc.,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>are separately pointed out as the cause, by writers of reputation.</p>
    <p>And while professors thus disagree, the ideas</p>
    <ul>
      <li>that there is a necessary conflict between capital and labor,</li>
      <li>that machinery is an evil,</li>
      <li>that competition must be restrained and interest abolished,</li>
      <li>that wealth may be created by the issue of money,</li>
      <li>that it is the duty of government to furnish capital or to furnish
        work,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>are rapidly making way among the great body of the people, who keenly feel
    a hurt and are sharply conscious of a wrong. Such ideas, which bring great
    masses of men, the repositories of ultimate political power, under the leadership
    of charlatans and demagogues, are fraught with danger; but they cannot be successfully
    combated until political economy shall give some answer to the great question
    which shall be consistent with all her teachings, and which shall commend itself
    to the perceptions of the great masses of men.</p>
    <p><B>It must be within the province of political economy to give such an answer</B>.
    For political economy is not a set of dogmas. It is the explanation of a certain
    set of facts. It is the science which, in the sequence of certain phenomena,
    seeks to trace mutual relations and to identify cause and effect, just as the
    physical sciences seek to do in other sets of phenomena. It lays its foundations
    upon firm ground. <B>The premises from which it makes its deductions are truths
    which have the highest sanction; axioms which we all recognize; upon which
    we safely base the reasoning and actions of every-day life, and which may be
    reduced to the metaphysical expression of the physical law that motion seeks
    the line of least resistance--<I>viz</I>., </B><FONT COLOR="#FF6600"><B><I>that
    men seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion</I></B></FONT><B>.</B> Proceeding
    from a basis thus assured, its processes, which consist simply in identification
    and separation, have the same certainty. In this sense it is as exact a science
    as geometry, which, from similar truths relative to space, obtains its conclusions
    by similar means, and its conclusions when valid should be as self-apparent.
    And although in the domain of political economy we cannot test our theories
    by artificially produced combinations or conditions, as may be done in some
    of the other sciences, yet we can apply tests no less conclusive, by comparing
    societies in which different conditions exist, or by, in imagination, separating,
    combining, adding or eliminating forces or factors of known direction.</p>
    <p>I propose in the following pages to attempt to solve by the methods of political
    economy the great problem I have outlined. <B>I propose to seek the law which
    associates poverty with progress, and increases want with advancing wealth;
    and I believe that in the explanation of this paradox we shall find the explanation
    of those recurring seasons of industrial and commercial paralysis which, viewed
    independent of their relations to more general phenomena, seem so inexplicable.</B> Properly
    commenced and carefully pursued, such an investigation must yield a conclusion
    that will stand every test, and as truth will correlate with all other truth.
    For in the sequence of phenomena there is no accident. Every effect has a cause,
    and every fact implies a preceding fact.</p>
    <p>That political economy, as at present taught, does not explain the persistence
    of poverty amid advancing wealth in a manner which accords with the deep-seated
    perceptions of men;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>that the unquestionable truths which it does teach are unrelated and
        disjointed;</li>

        step

<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/04_Land_spec_wages.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 4: Land Speculation
    Causes Reduced Wages</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is a cause, not yet adverted to, which must be taken into consideration
      fully to explain the influence of material progress upon the distribution of
      wealth.</p>
  <p>That cause is the confident expectation of the future enhancement of land
      values, which arises in all progressive countries from the steady increase
      of rent, and which leads to speculation, or the holding of land for a higher
      price than it would then otherwise bring. </p>
  <p>We have hitherto assumed, as is generally assumed in elucidations of the
    theory of rent, that the actual margin of cultivation always coincides with
    what may
      be termed the necessary margin of cultivation &#8212; that is to say, we
      have assumed that cultivation extends to less productive points only as
      it becomes
      necessary from the fact that natural opportunities are at the more productive
      points fully utilized.</p>
  <p>This, probably, is the case in stationary or very slowly progressing communities,
      but in rapidly progressing communities, where the swift and steady increase
      of rent gives confidence to calculations of further increase, it is not the
      case. In such communities, the confident expectation of increased prices produces,
      to a greater or less extent, the effects of a combination among landholders,
      and tends to the withholding of land from use, in expectation of higher prices,
      thus forcing the margin of cultivation farther than required by the necessities
      of production.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Whether we formulate it as an extension of the margin of production, or
    as a carrying of the rent line beyond the margin of production, the influence
      of speculation in land in increasing rent is a great fact which cannot
    be ignored
      in any complete theory of the distribution of wealth in progressive countries.
      It is the force, evolved by material progress, which tends constantly to
    increase rent in a greater ratio than progress increases production, and
    thus constantly
      tends, as material progress goes on and productive power increases, to
    reduce wages, not merely relatively, but absolutely. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/04_Land_spec_wages.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<p>Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to Henry
  George</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the law of human progress?&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George saw ours alone among the civilizations
    of the world as still progressing; all others had either petrified or had
    vanished. And in our civilization he had already detected alarming evidences
    of corruption and decay. So he sought out the forces that create civilization
    and the forces that destroy it. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He found the incentives to progress to be
    the desires inherent in human nature, and the motor of progress to be what
    he called mental power. But the mental power that is available for progress
    is only what remains after nonprogressive demands have been met. These demands
    George listed as maintenance and conflict. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his isolated state, primitive man's powers
    are required simply to maintain existence; only as he begins to associate
    in communities and to enjoy the resultant economies is mental power set free
    for higher uses. Hence, association is the first essential of progress: </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And as the wasteful expenditure of mental
    power in conflict becomes greater or less as the moral law which accords
    to each an equality of rights is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice)
    is the second essential of progress. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>Thus association in equality is
      the law of progress. </strong>Association frees mental power for expenditure
      in improvement, and equality, or justice, or freedom -- for the terms here
      signify the same thing, the recognition of the moral law -- prevents the
      dissipation of this power in fruitless struggles. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He concluded this phase of his analysis
    of civilization in these words:<strong> "The law of human progress, what
    is it but the moral law? Just as social adjustments promote justice, just
    as they acknowledge the equality of right between man and man, just as they
    insure to each the perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty
    of every other, must civilization advance. Just as they fail in this, must
    advancing civilization come to a halt and recede..."&nbsp;</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, as the primary relation of man
    is to the earth, so must the primary social adjustment concern the relation
    of man to the earth. Only that social adjustment which affords all mankind
    equal access to nature and which insures labor its full earnings will promote
    justice, acknowledge equality of right between man and man, and insure perfect
    liberty to each. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This, according to George, was what the
    single tax would do. It was why he saw the single tax as not merely a fiscal
    reform but as the basic reform without which no other reform could, in the
    long run, avail. This is why he said, "What is inexplicable, if we lose sight
    of man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear when we recognize
    it."... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>While he was working at the case, too, there
            happened one of those trivial incidents that turn out to be important
          in setting the course of one&#8217;s life. He heard an old printer say that
            in a new country wages are always high, while in an old country they are
            always low. George was struck by this remark and on thinking it over, he
            saw that it was true. Wages were certainly higher in the United States
            than in Europe, and he remembered that they were higher in Australia than
            in England. More than this, they were higher in the newer parts than in
            the older parts of the same country &#8212; higher in Oregon and
            California, for instance, than in New York and Pennsylvania.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>George used to say that this was the first
          little puzzle in political economy that ever came his way. He did not
          give it any thought until long after; in fact, he says he did not begin
          to think
          intently on any economic subject until conditions in California turned
          his mind that way. When finally he did so, however, the old printer&#8217;s
          words came back to him as a roadmark in his search for the cause of
          industrial depressions, and the cause of inequality in the distribution
          of wealth.
          ... </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>So it went. Every turn of public affairs brought
          up the old haunting questions. Even here in California he was now seeing
          symptoms of the same inequality that had oppressed him in New York. &#8220;Bonanza
          kings&#8221; were coming to the front, and four ex-shopkeepers of Sacramento,
          Stanford, Crocker, Huntington, and Hopkins, were laying up immense
          fortunes out of the Central Pacific. The <a href="Railroads.html">railway</a> was
          bringing in population and commodities, which everybody thought was a good
          thing all round, yet wages were going down, exactly as the old printer
          in Philadelphia had said, and the masses were growing worse off instead
          of better.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>About this matter of wages, George had had
          other testimony besides the old printer&#8217;s. On his way to Oregon a
          dozen years before, he fell in with a lot of miners who were talking about
          the Chinese, and ventured to ask what harm the Chinese were doing as long
          as they worked only the cheap diggings. &#8220;No harm now,&#8221; one
          of the miners said, &#8220;but wages will not always be as high as
          they are today in California. <a href="Population_Growth.html">As the country
          grows, as people come in, wages will go down</a>, and some day or other
          white people will be glad to get those diggings that the Chinamen are
          working.&#8221; George
          said that this idea, coming on top of what the printer had said, made a
          great impression on him &#8212; the idea that &#8220;<a href="Progress.html">as
          the country grew in all that we are hoping that it might grow</a>,
          the condition of those who had to work for their living must become,
          not better,
          but worse.&#8221; Yet in the short space of a dozen years this was
          precisely what was taking place before his own eyes.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">Still, though his two great questions became
        more and more pressing, he could not answer them. His thought was still
        inchoate. He went around and around his ultimate answer, like somebody
        fumbling after something on a table in the dark, often actually touching
        it without being aware that it was what he was after. Finally it came to
        him in a burst of true Cromwellian or Pauline drama out of &#8220;the commonplace
        reply of a passing teamster to a commonplace question.&#8221; One day in
        1871 he went for a horseback ride, and as he stopped to rest his horse
        on a rise overlooking San Francisco Bay &#8212;</div>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">&#8220;I asked a passing teamster, for want
              of something better to say, what land was worth there. He pointed to
              some cows grazing so far off that they looked like mice, and said, &#8217;I
              don&#8217;t know exactly, but there is a man over there who will sell
              some land for a thousand dollars an acre.&#8217; Like a flash it came
              over me that there was the reason of advancing poverty with advancing
              wealth. <a href="Population_Growth.html">With the growth of population</a>,
              land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.&#8221;</div>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">Yes, there it was. Why had wages suddenly
          shot up so high in California in 1849 that cooks in the restaurants of
          San Francisco got $500 a month? The reason now was simple and clear. It
          was because the placer mines were found on <a href="Land_Common_Property.html">land
          that did not belong to anybody</a>. Any one could go to them and work them
          without having to pay an owner for the privilege. If the lands had been
          owned by somebody, it would have been land-values instead of wages that
          would have so suddenly shot up.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Exactly this was what had taken place on these
          grazing lands overlooking San Francisco Bay. The Central Pacific meant
          to make its terminus at Oakland, the increased population would need
          the land around Oakland to settle on, and land values had jumped up
          to a thousand
          dollars an acre. Naturally, then, George reasoned, the more public
          improvements there were, the better the transportation facilities,
          the larger the population,
          the more industry and commerce &#8212; the more of everything that makes
          for &#8220;prosperity&#8221; &#8212; the more would land values tend
          to rise, and the more would wages and interest tend to fall.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>George rode home thoughtful, translating the
          teamster&#8217;s commonplace reply into the technical terms of economics.
          He reasoned that there are <a href="Three-Factor_Economics.html">three
          factors in the production of wealth</a>, and only three: natural resources,
          labor, and capital. When natural resources are unappropriated, obviously
          the whole yield of production is divided into wages, which go to labor,
          and interest, which goes to capital. But when they are appropriated,
          production has to carry a third charge &#8212; <a href="../themes/Rent.html">rent</a>.
          Moreover, wages and interest, when there is no rent, are regulated
          strictly by free competition; but rent is a monopoly-charge, and hence
          is always &#8220;all
          the traffic will bear.&#8221;</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;">Well, then, since <a href="Natural_Resources.html">natural
          resource values</a> are purely social in their origin, created by the
          community, should not rent go to the community rather than to the Individual? <a href="Untaxing.html">Why
          tax industry and enterprise at all</a> &#8212; why not just charge rent?
          There would be no need to interfere with the private ownership of natural
          resources. Let a man own all of them he can get his hands on, and make
          as much out of them as he may, untaxed; but let him pay the community
          their annual rental value, determined simply by what other people would
          be willing to pay for the use of the same holdings. George could see
          justification for wages and interest, on the ground of natural right;
          and for private ownership of natural resources, on the ground of public
          policy; but he could see none for the private appropriation of economic
          rent. In his view it was sheer <a href="Theft.html">theft</a>. If he
          was right, then it also followed that as long as economic rent remains
          unconfiscated, <a href="Piracy.html">the taxation of industry and enterprise
          is pure highwaymanry</a>, especially <a href="../themes/Tariffs.html">tariff</a> taxation,
          for this virtually delegates the government&#8217;s taxing power to private
