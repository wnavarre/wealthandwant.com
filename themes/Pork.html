<blockquote>
  <p>Congress votes each year on a lot of legislation which is collectively known
      as &quot;pork.&quot; Pork spending is generally for local wants, and most
      of it has a single effect: it increases land values in the immediate surrounding
      area. Be it a bridge, or a highway, or a museum, its effect is to make
      living
      in the immediate area more appealing &#8212; or more specifically, owning
      land there more lucrative. The effect may be very local &#8212; benefiting
      just a few fortunate property owners &#8212; or  may ripple out a bit.
      But clearly people who benefit not at all (federal taxpayers in other states)
      are paying to provide a windfall for a relatively small group of property
      holders.</p>
  <p>To take a 2005 example, there is a proposal for a bridge in Alaska which
    is to cost $223 million. The proposed bridge will connect a 61,400-acre island
      to the town of Ketchican. A 33-acre property on that island, owned
    by the family which
      includes both the governor and one
      of Alaska's
      US
      senators, is valued at $245,000. If every acre on that island is valued
      similarly, the land on that island is now worth $442 million. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the building of the bridge
              <em>increases</em> the island's land value by 50%, that increase
              will be enough to pay for the bridge! </li>
    <li>If it <em>fails to increase</em> the island's land value by 50%, why
      would we think the project worth
                doing?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(2006 brought us two additional examples: a new federally funded highway
    in Illinois that increased the value of land held by Dennis Hastert, and
    a proposed bridge in the southwest which would benefit Harry Reid. Do we
    need more examples before we understand?)</p>
  <p><strong>But the question to consider here is why the <em>Federal government
                    taxpayer</em> should pay the $223 million, and the Alaskans who own
          property on that island should get to <em>privatize</em>        the increase in land value.</strong></p>
  <p>The alternative? Collect 25% &#8212; or 50%, or 75%, or more &#8212; of
    that increase as
      our common treasure, and recycle it,  to build some good project in
      another state! <strong>Why on earth should that increase in land value, created
      by our common spending, become someone's <em>private</em> property?</strong></p>
  <p>Does the picture change at all if the owners of the land on that island
    are corporations? foreign entities? pension funds? federal entities that
    lease
      land to users at full price? federal entities that
    lease
      land to users at a highly discounted price? national parks?
    individual speculators? longtime residents? Something to ponder. </p>
  <p><strong>Land value taxation would return that increase in land value to
      the commons, where it belongs.</strong> And then we could reduce our perverse
      taxes on wages and sales and buildings, which is what the &quot;starve government&quot;
      folks seem to want. But we don't seek to starve government, just return
      to the commons what is rightly the property of the commons.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE SOURCE OF PUBLIC
REVENUE </b></small>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What are the factors that cause
land to have market value and to
whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
market value for three reasons: </small><small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
productivity of the soil and natural resources, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the publicly provided
services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
value of land and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the growth of communities and peoples' competitive
demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that
people and businesses are willing to
pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
be used as revenue, by the
community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
for the period of time. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>ENVIRONMENTAL
PRESERVATION </b></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is the
responsibility of the local communities to insure that
the market rent of land is collected for public purposes. When a
major part of land rent is not collected, which is the case in most
of the world today, land title holders obtain rights to sell the
value of the public improvements which were made by the whole
community. The community added to the market value of land by making
improvements which increases demand and rent for the land. The longer
the possessors hold the land out of use the greater will be the bonus
they obtain.</span></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By prohibiting people from using
good land, the possessors force
the premature use of other less desirable land, which is more distant
from the city. This raises the cost of community improvements and the
rental value of the unused, but better located, land. This
precipitates the degradation of the rural environment by using city
land inefficiently -- and creates huge unnecessary pressures on the
natural environment.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A problem that we face is that
cities throughout the world are
spreading out and using land prematurely which is not needed and
should not be used. That is because failure to collect land rent
subsidizes the waste of natural resources and clutters the
environment. Cities that collect the full rental value of land are
more compact and provide greater and less costly amenities for their
citizens.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any moves to enact good government
principles without collecting
the full market rent of the land may result in a failure. People are
guided by the profit motive. When people can make a larger profit by
doing nothing, but keeping the land they possess out of use for a
long period of time, they will do so. When the community collects the
full market rent of land, they eliminate the motive for keeping land
out of efficient use, because the unearned profit has been collected
as public revenue.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Efficient land use appeals to all
people because it surpasses the
political constraints of most people. Everybody understands that the
earth belongs equally to all people. They want a clean environment on
earth and to leave a healthy inheritance to the future generations,
regardless of their political viewpoints.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<small>The major function of a competent city government is to provide
good community services by collecting the land rent created within
the community to ensure the efficient use of land and equal
opportunities for all of its citizens. Transportation is an important
function of government which would facilitate the creation of a
compact city, where people can easily find the facilities they desire
for education, commerce, religion and recreation. Good
land use, with the freedom of individuals to achieve the highest and
best use of land, would ensure a desirable community. A compact city
would reduce the need to invade the wilderness and devastate the
environment. ... <a

  Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some may wonder why anyone would own land if most of the rent is taxed away.
    One would own land for the same reason people rent land: in order to use
    it. Ownership also gives the title holder rights of possession, the ability
    to control the use of the site indefinitely.</p>
  <p>Today there is also a speculative motive for owning land, to profit from
    the increase in its price. <strong>With most of the geo-rent tapped for public
    revenue, the speculative motive would be dampened. That would benefit the
    economy, since with a lower price of land, funds that now go to buy land
    would instead go to build more capital goods, hire more labor, or provide
    better training.</strong></p>
  <p>The tax on the geo-rent would be borne by the owner, not the tenant. If
    a landlord, who was already charging what the market could bear, tried to
    pass on the tax, he would face vacancies. Some say that since the tax would
    be invisible to renters, the link between using public services and paying
    for them would be broken. But productive public services increase the geo-rent,
    so that link is there.<strong> If government revenue is wasted, then indeed
    this does not generate rent, and a land value tax without corresponding benefits
    would reduce land value. Pressure for a productive use of public revenue
    would come from the landowners more than from the tenants. </strong>But that is no
    different than the situation today; poor folks pay little or no income tax
    and no property tax, and typically they get government assistance. This is
    an argument not against the use of rent, but in favor of privatizing government
    programs. In the private sector, the link between ownership and control is
    stronger. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

  Nic Tideman: <a

  Tenets of the Incentive Taxation Philosophy</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Creating a More
Productive Economy</b>
</small><br>
<small>The ideas we espouse are attractive not only for their
embodiment
of principles of justice, but also because they can be expected to
lead to a more productive economy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists agree that the
imposition of taxes generally retards an
economy. The reason for this is that with almost all taxes, it is
possible for a tax payer to reduce total tax collections by doing
less of whatever is taxed--work less, spend less, save less, etc.
This means that taxes generate an incentive to be less
productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With fees for the use of
government-assigned opportunities, on the
other hand, the only thing that a person can do to reduce the amount
of money that he or she pays is to use fewer of these opportunities.
But then the opportunities can be used by someone else, who will pay
the fees, and total public revenue will be unchanged. There is no
possibility reducing total government revenue by being less
productive. Thus these fees can be collected without dragging down
the economy in the way that existing taxes do.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our ideas provide for the natural
financing of any worthwhile
public expenditure that makes a particular area more attractive or
productive--parks, freeways, subways, sewer systems, etc. These
public expenditures raise the rental value of land in their vicinity,
and thereby raise the fees that can be collected for using the land.
If the activity is worthwhile, the increase in rental values will be
sufficient to pay for the activity.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another way in
which our ideas promote a more efficient economy is
by eliminating the opportunity grow rich by having government promote
one's own interest at the expense of others. Such distortions of the
political process can occur either by persuading a government agency
to spend money in a way that raises the value of land that one owns
while others foot the bill, or by persuading a government agency to
prohibit others from doing what one is permitted to do. In both kinds
of cases, the person who promotes his or her own interest has no
reason to take account of the costs that are thereby imposed on
others, and typically these costs to others are greater than the
self-seeking benefits. This makes the economy less productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, the very possibility
of growing rich by manipulating
government action draws talented people into the effort to manipulate
government decisions, when they could be employed doing something
useful. </small><small>...&nbsp; <a

<p>Nic Tideman: <small><small><a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">Improving
        Efficiency and Preventing Exploitation in Taxing and Spending Decisions</a></small></small></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The efficiency of the competitive equilibrium requires that the sharing of
    the pre-development rental value of land (that part of the rental value of
    land that is not accounted for by local public goods) and the value of other
    natural opportunities be unaffected by migration or political competition.
    If the distribution of the returns to natural opportunities depends on where
    people live or on political competition, then efficiency will fall because
    of inefficient location decisions and rent seeking losses. For example, if
    the returns to oil in Alaska are divided among the people who live in Alaska,
    then people will move to Alaska inefficiently to share in the bounty. If the
    distribution of the returns to natural opportunities depends on political competition,
    then there will be rent-seeking losses from such competition. A non-exploitive
    and reasonably efficient local public sector is thus possible through competition
  among communities.</p>
  <p>What, then, about public goods that have benefits over greater areas? If
    only a few localities are involved, one might expect them to negotiate voluntary
    compacts with reasonable efficiency. "Pork barrel" projects--all projects
    with benefits for only a small region of the country--should not be paid
    for with
    national taxes. The practice leads to the approval of inefficient projects
    as a result of the politicking of those who benefit, and it unjustly exploits
    those who do not benefit.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For truly national public goods, other ideas
      must be explored.</span> One of the major national public goods is defense.
      In a perfectly just world, everyone would be so respectful of the rights
      of others, and everyone would feel so safe that no defense spending would
      be desired. In a less perfect world, many people, but not all, want public
      defense expenditures. How can they be provided justly?</p>
  <p>Some financing of <span style="font-weight: bold;">defense </span>expenditures
    can be provided by a Pigouvian tax on the externality of accumulating capital,
    which makes a nation a more attractive target of aggression. If the U.S. requires
    a greater defense budget than Canada, which is larger in area, it is because
    the greater value of the assets in the U.S. makes the U.S. a more attractive
    target of aggression. Thus anyone who owns capital might reasonably be charged
    for the increase in the defense budget that is needed to make other citizens
    as safe as they would be if that one person's capital were not adding to the
    attractiveness of nation as a target. It would be interesting to know how much
    of the defense budget could be covered by such charges. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I propose a self-assessed tax of, perhaps, 1% per
    year on the value of all assets and contractual rights, to pay the costs of
    defense. The owner assesses the value and pays a corresponding tax, and if
    anyone wants to buy the asset at the assessed value, it is sold.</span> There
    could be a personal exemption of perhaps $50,000 per year, and an exemption
    for personal papers. There could be a local add-on to pay the costs of local
    police and courts. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read the whole

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements.<br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Back in the early days of this
century, Winston Churchill saw and
recorded an example of this. There had been a ferry fare over the
river Thames for the common laborers who lived on the wrong side of
the river to pay in order to get to work. A spirit of nobility
prompted the absorption of this fare by the City, and almost
immediately rents in the working class area were increased by the
same amount as the fare had been. When this thing was done, the guys
who got the benefit were not the poor working class people, but the
owners of the homes in which they lived, or, more accurately and more
critically, the owners of the land on which those homes stood. The
laborers were thus charged a higher rent, and that rent diverted the
benefit from the seemingly intended beneficiary (i.e., the public) to
landowners in the affected area.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This occurs every day in this
country. A new road is built, or a
superhighway is constructed, which makes access to a particular site
much easier. We tell ourselves that we justify this as an
expenditure of public funds by the benefits that accrue to the
traveling public; but the benefits go, in the form of higher land
prices and rents, to the owners of the sites that are served by this
new road. If you doubt this, consider the jockeying for the insider
information or for influence over the selection.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Robert Caro, in his biography of
Robert Moses, recalls the time in
the early 1920s that Moses suggested to the authorities the building
of a causeway from the Long Island mainland over to Jones Island.
This proposal was rejected outright by the Long Island Park
Commission. Some months later, Moses presented them with a drawing
showing precisely where this causeway would run, and, after a
suitable period of during which these public employees could buy up
the land along the proposed highway, he resubmitted his proposal.
This time, they officially approved the suggested construction.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the town of Antioch, Illinois,
there were two developments
underway almost simultaneously. In the one, roads were provided,
together with water and sewer lines, but no sidewalks; in the other,
just across a main road from the first, the mayor of the city had
storm sewers, curbs and sidewalks installed at public expense, for
which of course, any prospective buyer or tenant would gladly pay for
use of that land the higher price these added benefits provided. Any
reader will recognize this chain of events and set of economic
relationships as being the course of everyday life and business at
the local, state and national level. <b>The cynic would say that a
primary motivation for entering local or even national politics would
be the opportunity for personal gain offered daily by publicly
financed improvements. ...</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus, the benefits of a
tax-supported public work accrued once
more not to the benefit of the public at large, but to that of a very
limited and narrowly defined class, those who were rich enough to own
land in that location.</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are undoubtedly many other
problems to be resolved before
the ills of our society are cured; but what many do not recognize and
understand is the primacy of the adoption of land value taxation over
all these other corrections. The reason for that can be very simply
stated: <b>If any of these other measures already adopted have no
merit and have only added to the burden of our problems, then they
are disqualified at the outset. On the other hand, if they are of
themselves beneficial, any benefit from them will be immediately
capitalized into land values and will therefore exacerbate the very
problems which otherwise might be helped toward a cure.</b> Thus it
is that our first step toward any possible remedy for the awesome
plight into which we have been led increasingly over the recent years
must be the adoption of land value taxation. </small><small>... <a

to provinces, whereas in the
United States it goes to specific cities, The U.S. Congressman likes
to have his fingerprint, as they say, on every dollar that goes from

and fewer than the American States. There is much more horizontal
balancing among provinces in Canada than there is among States in the
United States. The Maritimes for instance get about 50% of their
provincial revenues from equalisation entitlements. Fifty percent.
Nothing in the United States matches that. In fact, if you look at
the U.S. Constitution, it's quite specifically planned to prevent
that sort of thing. Equalisation is not what the Founding Fathers had
in mind. On the contrary, there is a provision which you may be
familiar with which says that direct taxes will be apportioned among
the States according to their respective populations. So in the
States the idea has been: <b>Tax the States according to their
population and then give the money back according to political
power.</b> In the United States Senate it means that the smallest
State has just as much clout as the biggest State or would have if
their senators weren't so merchantable. (I mean, in California when
we need something we just look to Nevada or one of those places for a
Senator who is having difficulty raising funds for his next election.

Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices with practical

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> Fostering
economy in government in the very process of raising revenue</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Anti-governmentalists often
identify any tax policy with public
extravagance. Georgist tax policies, on the contrary, help save
public funds in at least two general ways.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>a. Putting the unemployed
to work saves many public costs,
like welfare, obviously, crime-fighting, and, ultimately, putting down
civil disturbances and insurrections. </small>
  <p><small>b. Putting the unemployed to work also raises demand and,
by so
doing, helps make plain to all the desirability of unleashing supply.
Now, supply in some industries is deliberately held down to support
prices. U.S. agriculture is a good example: supply restraints are
transparent because they are matters of public law. The U.S.D.A. pays
landowners to fallow some 60 million acres each year, to raise food and
clothing prices. Under Georgist policy those acres would go to work
producing food and paying taxes, both.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>c. Georgist policies obviate subeconomic extensions of
public
works, which now are pushed by the powerful combination of land
speculators seeking increments, the jobless seeking work, and the
homeless seeking shelter. Georgist policies open up the naturally
better land to settlement, thus relieving the pressure to invade flood
plains, steep erosive slopes, flammable brushlands, wetlands, and other
places that soak up heavy public funds to reach, develop, service, and
protect.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the same
time, these policies deflate
the "rent-seeking"
motivations of land speculators to sue for state and federal aid. Under
George's scheme, the unearned increments secured by
"rent-seeking" lobbying for public works would be taxed away.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the longer run it seems

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> Territorial
expansion:</b> Regional cross-subsidy, with subeconomic extension of
public works and services. George&#8217;s critique of land speculation
came to be focused on
&#8220;<b>Speculator Type

have neglected to condemn the counterpart
&#8220;<b>Speculator Type

marginal lands cheaply, and then lobbies
public agencies to extend roads, utilities, military and police
protection, and other public services to them, below cost.</span></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some Georgists may even see this
as a legitimate way, and an
easier way, to combat the artificial scarcity of land that Speculator
Type #1 causes &#8211; a way of perpetuating the &#8220;frontier
safety-valve.&#8221; However, it unbalances development severely: too
much roading, et al., too little use of the land thus &#8220;opened
up.&#8221; Some taxpayer must pay for the roading et al. If the taxes
are activity-based or improvement-based (i.e. anything but land
taxes) they will sterilize marginal land, and lower the intensity of
use of all land. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a pervasive, immanent bias
in most of our institutions,
from city departments of public works up through state and provincial
public utilities commissions and highway departments, clear to the
Pentagon, World Bank, and CIA. Types #1 and #2, in tandem, create our
form of Imperialism, that perpetual quest for Lebensraum that is our
curse. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In my political experiences, one
collects more cuts and bruises
combating Speculators Type #2 than Type #1. I was, for example, able
to lead the local countywide campaign against Howard Jarvis&#8217;
&#8220;Proposition 13&#8221; without being seriously punished, but a
few years later when I led the campaign against southern
California&#8217;s favorite public water-works boondoggle, the
&#8220;Peripheral Canal,&#8221; my academic and professional world
collapsed about me. Earlier, when I joined the furor against American
imperialism (Gaffney, 1971) and the myth of infinite natural
resources (Gaffney, 1972), I became persona non grata at Resources
for the Future, Inc., where I then worked. In British Columbia, 1975,
I learned that the self-styled &#8220;socialist&#8221; government under
Premier David Barrett was unwilling even to consider withdrawing any
of its expensive cross-subsidies to speculators Type #2, and resented
me for raising the issue. The moose-pastures of northern B.C.
&#8220;are a mighty empire,&#8221; they told me, and the rich retirees
on the Gulf Islands are important constituents who should have both
their subsidized ferry service and their exclusionary zoning to keep
hoi polloi from sharing it. I have war stories, but the objective
point is that the socio-political bias for territorial expansion is
even stronger than the bias against cultivating, intensifying and
renewing our internal frontiers. The Georgist dream of taxing central
rents to finance public services becomes a nightmare when the public
money is dissipated in enriching Speculators Type #2. This kind of
spending not only dissipates rents, and wastes capital, at the same
time it despoils the environment. Worst of all, as the subeconomic
land development proceeds, each new settlement makes a platform for
the next, so there is no end to it short of the limits of capital and
of Earth. It is perhaps fortunate for Earth that, historically, the
limits of capital have been reached first, at the ends of bursts of
territorial overexpansion.

    Suppose that a state government placed a tax of 10% on the value that land
    would have if it were unimproved, and suppose that there was a local project
    that would cost $95,000 per year and raise the rental value of local land by
    $100,000 per year. The project would be socially beneficial, and if there were
    no national tax on the rental value of land, the local government would find
    that undertaking the project would improve the welfare of its citizens. However,
    one effect of the project would be to increase by $10,000 (10% of $100,000)
    the amount of money that the citizens of the locality were required to pay

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But before this time the reader, unless he has given previous attention
    to the subject, is full of objections to the above doctrine: &quot;How about the
      law?&quot; he is asking. &quot;Hasn't a man the right to buy a piece of land
      as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and hold on to it till
      he gets ready to sell?&quot; The answer is that at present he certainly
      has this statutory right, which has been so long and so universally recognized
      that most people suppose it to be not only a legal, but a real or equitable
      right. A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth of population in
      a
      city, for example, can buy a well-located block at a moderate figure from
      some less far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against
      all
      comers and give it no further attention except to pay the very small tax
      usually imposed upon vacant land.</p>
  <p>Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
      stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police and
      fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently that
      the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times what
      it cost him. <strong>Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the very
      community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its taxes created
      practically the whole value of the land in question!</strong></p>
  <p>It was said above that an individual has a statutory right to pursue this
      very common course. That was an error. The statement should have been that
      he has a statutory wrong; for no disinterested person can follow the course
      of land speculation as almost universally practiced, without feeling its rank
      injustice.</p>
  <p>  How did so evident a wrong become so firmly established?<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>The landlords, being also the lawmakers, have seen to it that their tenure
       of this easy money should not be disturbed, but on the contrary have so buttressed
       it with centuries of legislation, precedents, and judicial decisions, that
       any proposition to hark back to the terms of the original bargain, whereby
       the owners of the land agreed to pay the expenses of the government, is now
       denounced as anarchy and sacrilege.</p>
  <p>   Lapse of time, however, never can transform wrong into right, nor can a buyer
         acquire any better title than the seller possessed. The economic rent belongs
         to the community, which can and will begin to reclaim it as soon as the
         voters thoroughly awake to the facts and the right and wrong of the matter,
         which are not hard to grasp when the subject is presented in its simplest
         form.</p>
  <p>An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm land.
       Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot centrally
       located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by, say, Mr. John
       William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom.
       It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.
       There is a little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure
       ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
       subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's
       growth in which<strong> the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
       in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to, say,
       two hundred times its early value.</strong></p>
  <p>About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and can't
       be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure of
       population is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public money to
       the benefit of this land must continue, he will not sell it. So he gives a
       twenty-one year lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a year net, with a privilege
       to the lessee of renewals at advancing figures. The lessee agrees to pay all
       taxes.</p>
  <p>Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which will be regularly remitted to
       Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever he may be, given in payment for?
    Not for the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does is to pull it
       down. Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock, which has got to
       be blasted out as part of its improvement.</p>
  <p>Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community, and
       the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the present
       $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command in later
       years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs to the community
       and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>
  <p>That the latter has no good right to it is at once evident when we remember
       that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody else has got to
       give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000 that some men and women
       have got to work to earn every year to hand over to a man who does not
       render, and does not feel any obligation to render, one dollar's worth
       of public or
       private service in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice which
       we call law. It is not comical only because it is frankly tragic in its
       social results.</p>
  <p>Now suppose this $20,000 and all the rest of this same community product &#8212; i.e.,
       the site or location rent of its ground &#8212; were paid every year to
       its rightful owner, the treasurer of New York City, what would become
       of taxation,
       with its inseparable retinue, Fraud, Evasion, Perjury, Inequality, and
       an all-pervading public sense of injustice?</p>
  <p>An authority on municipal taxation estimates the present economic rent of
       the land embraced in the City of New York at from $350,000,000 to $400,000,000.
       Assuming the lesser of these figures and adding the receipts from licenses,
       fees and fines, New York City should receive, of her own income, enough to
       pay all her own legitimate bills, to make her proper contributions to county
       and state and build a new subway or its equivalent every year.</p>
  <p>And this with nobody paying a dollar of taxes, or, if we except the fines,
       a dollar that he was not ready and glad to pay for his own advantage. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Are George&#8217;s arguments about land ownership and wealth inequality
    relevant today? Australia provides an interesting example, because land is
    the single largest item in national wealth. Laurie Aarons outlines the concentration
    of farming land in particular in the hands of a few very wealthy corporations
    and individuals &#8211; what he refers to as &#8216;corporate squattocracy&#8217; (Aarons,
    1999: 23). The relentless increase in urban land values in recent years has
    also produced dramatic redistributions of wealth. In the State of New South
    Wales, for example, land values increased by about $361 billion over the
    period 1993 &#8211; 2003. The existing land-based taxes clawed back only
    $44 billion in government revenues, comprising only about 12% of the land-related
    economic surplus. So 88% was retained as &#8216;unearned income&#8217; by
    landowners (Stilwell and Jordan, forthcoming). A higher rate of land tax
    with fewer exemptions could have substantially reduced this private wealth
    appropriation. This is not necessarily to posit the desirability of recouping
    100% through land tax, because that would certainly raise major problems
    of people&#8217;s ability to pay, given that much of the increased wealth
    resulting from land price inflation has not been realised as current income.
    But it is indicative of the current imbalance between private and public
    appropriations of the surplus arising from increases in land-based wealth.
