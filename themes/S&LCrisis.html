      Land: How and why land gets undervalued</a></p>
  </div>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As noted, the anomaly occurs
when real estate prices fall. Real
estate prices are volatile, while construction costs rarely dip more
than slightly, if at all. When real estate prices turn down, they
often plunge below the reproduction cost of buildings. Hence, the
residual ("land") rises and falls much more sharply than do building
replacement costs (which are estimated as rising at a fairly steady
pace) and overall property values.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result is a curious asymmetry.
Building prices seem to be
responsible for the rise in real estate prices, while land prices are
held responsible for their decline. When the fall in property values
intersects the rising reproduction-cost trend, the land residual
turns negative.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because this land value often
represents the owner's equity, this
decline may prompt heavily indebted owners to default on their loans
or even to walk away from their property, which reverts to the bank
or other mortgage holder. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">In this sense
the financial system itself
is based largely on real estate, as the economy learned in the
savings and loan (S&amp;L) deposit insurance crisis of the late
1980s. </span>Real estate prices reflect the supply of property
(including a
fixed supply of land) as compared with the fluctuating supply of
mortgage credit, which tends to be a function of the economy's
overall liquidity.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Land Without
Giveaway</a></small> (1990)</small><small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Credit follows collateral. In
periods of high and rising land
prices, borrowers get used to pledging land to secure loans, and
lenders get used to demanding it. Socializing land rent, as proposed
herein, lowers or eliminates the value of land as loan
collateral.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the good side, this lack of
land collateral would stop lenders'
discriminating in favor of landowners, as they do now. It would
remove a major cause of the concentration of economic power and
control, that is the clustering of credit around original nuclei of
large, superior landholdings. The credit is often used to buy still
more land, to reserve for possible future use and at the same time to
withhold from competitors. Such concentration and market control form
the ugly side of extant Western "capitalism," when enterprise
degenerates into greed and acquisitions supplant innovations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As Rainer Schikele wrote, "the
basis of credit is not marginal
productivity but collateral security." He meant that lenders are
concerned not with the productive use of their loans, but with the
security provided by borrowers' ownership of old wealth.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As Keynes put it in his General
Theory, there are two kinds of
risks: investment risk proper, and lender's risk. "Investment risk"
depends on the productivity of new capital; "lenders' risk" depends
on borrowers' old collateral, like land. The social purpose of
investing is to create capital; the individual purpose is to buy
income with security. The second purpose leads lenders to lend to the
rich in preference to the productive. The principles are at odds; the
productivity principle is clearly better from the viewpoint of basic
micro efficiency.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The marginal productivity basis of
lending is also better in terms
of macro stability. Flows of credit dominated by cycles in the land
market are highly unstable. The current S&amp;L calamity in the U.S.
exemplifies and should settle the point. It has many precedents,
going back at least to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of 1634 and the
French-English Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles of 1720. The rule
has been that following each collapse the hung-over lenders woke up
penitent. Reacting to the excesses they adopted something like the
English Banking School philosophy of avoiding real estate loans and
sticking with self-liquidating commercial loans, only to fall off the
wagon in the next land boom, repeating the cycle. How easily one
generation forgets the hard lessons life taught the one before. "When
will they ever learn?"</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the absence of land booms,
however, bankers would have to stay
on the wagon. On the bad side, low land prices raise new problems of
how to transfer funds to builders. If the free market is to provide
ample flows of investment, the credit system must adjust to life
without land values. Actually, however, it has often done so anyway,
following the periodic collapses of land markets such as those
already cited, plus those of 1798, 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, and
1929, to mention only the extreme cases. In those periods of
atonement credit systems worked quite well without depending on real
estate as collateral. We would be much better off to keep them
working that way permanently.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Many particular lenders practice
the arts of lending without land
collateral. Factoring inventories is a thriving business. Building on
leased land is commonplace, with both private lessors like the
Wrigley Company of Catalina Island and the Irvine Company of Orange
County, California; and public lessors like the Crown Provincial of
British Columbia, the County of Los Angeles, The Port of San
Francisco, the State of Alaska, and countless others. Chattel
mortgages are common, secured by movable capital. Even construction
loans are secured mainly by capital, not land, because new buildings
normally outvalue their sites, even on dear land and more so on cheap
land. Some developers borrow on the security of signed leases.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As credit follows collateral, so
it flees taxes. The policy
proposed here is not just to tax land, but to untax capital, and
untax profits drawn from skill in management, and untax wages and
salaries generally. That which is less taxed becomes more
creditworthy. The flow of credit will turn away from those with
accumulated wealth and monopoly towards those with skill and daring
to use it better. The result is to make capitalism work as
advertised, not in the decadent way as charged....<a href="../docs/Gaffney_PLWG.html"> <span
