      <p>I have friends who make every effort to conserve water and energy, not
              to save money but because they believe they are making an important contribution
              toward environmental sustainability. But until we fix the perverse incentives
              which encourage overuse by the largest users, conservation efforts by a
              few or even by millions of individuals are useless, merely subsidizing
              the large users.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>Our elected representatives at all levels of government need to examine
              the perverse incentives and replace them with incentives that reward
        the kinds of behavior that promote sustainability and equality. A logical
        starting
              point, of course, is the property tax. When the property tax rate
        and/or the assessments on some people's property are artificially capped,
        as in California's
              Proposition 13 or Florida's Save Our Homes, the landholders still
        receive most of the services that support their property values,
              but others get to pay for them. Worse, older people have an incentive
              to stay in houses that are too large for their needs and close
        to jobs they
              no
              longer have, while younger people who need larger homes for their
        families end up commuting many hours each day, at a high cost to them
        and to society.
              Housing prices rise out of sight, driven by the finiteness of
              land and the scarcity of properties for sale.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>Correcting the perverse incentives would cure many of these problems.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>Similarly,  the property tax as we commonly know it is the marriage
              of two taxes that have very different effects. The tax on land values has
              desirable effects, while the tax on buildings, usually at the same millage
              rate, has only undesirable effects. To increase the tax on land values,
              most towns have to increase the tax on buildings as well, and they suffer
              from the perverse incentives that building taxes bring. The solution? 
              Divorce the tax rate on buildings and the tax rate on building values,
              and start lowering the taxes on your buildings, and increasing the taxes
              on local land values. </p>

                <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common
                Sense of Taxation</a> (1881 article)</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>To illustrate: A man builds a fine house or large factory
                    in a poorly improved neighborhood. To tax this building and
                    its adjuncts is to make him pay for his enterprise and expenditure &#8212; to
                    take from him part of his natural reward. But the improvement
                    thus made has given new beauty or life to the neighborhood,
                    making it a more desirable place than before for the erection
                    of other houses or factories, and additional value is given
                    to land all about. Now to tax improvements is not only to
                    deprive of his proper reward the man who has made the improvement,
                    but it is to deter others from making similar improvements.
                    But, instead of taxing improvements, to tax these land values
                    is to leave the natural inducement to further improvement
                    in full force, and at the same time to keep down an obstacle
                    to further improvement, which, under the present system,
                    improvement itself tends to raise. For the advance of land
                    values which follows improvement, and even the expectation
                  of improvement, makes further improvement more costly.</p>
                  <p>See how unjust and short-sighted is this system. Here is
                    a man who, gathering what little capital he can, and taking
                    his family, starts West to find a place where he can make
                    himself a home. He must travel long distances; for, though
                    he will pass plenty of land nobody is using, it is held at
                    prices too high for him. Finally he will go no further, and
                    selects a place where, since the creation of the world, the
                    soil, so far as we know, has never felt a plowshare. But
                    here, too, in nine cases out of ten, he will find the speculator
                    has been ahead of him, for the speculator moves quicker,
                    and has superior means of information to the emigrant. Before
                    he can put this land to the use for which nature intended
                    it, and to which it is for the general good that it should
                    be put, he must make terms with some man who in all probability
                    never saw the land, and never dreamed of using it, and who,
                    it may be, resides in some city, thousands of miles away.
                    In order to get permission to use this land, he must give
                    up a large part of the little capital which is seed-wheat
                    to him, and perhaps in addition mortgage his future labor
                    for years. Still he goes to work: he works himself, and his
                    wife works, and his children work &#8212; work like horses,
                    and live in the hardest and dreariest manner. Such a man
                    deserves encouragement, not discouragement; but on him taxation
                    falls with peculiar severity. Almost everything that he has
                    to buy &#8212; groceries, clothing, tools &#8212; is largely
                    raised in price by a system of tariff taxation which cannot
                    add to the price of the grain or hogs or cattle that he has
                    to sell. And when the assessor comes around he is taxed on
                    the improvements he has made, although these improvements
                    have added not only to the value of surrounding land, but
                    even to the value of land in distant commercial centers.
                    Not merely this, but, as a general rule, his land, irrespective
                    of the improvements, will be assessed at a higher rate than
                    unimproved land around it, on the ground that &quot;productive
                    property&quot; ought to pay more than &quot;unproductive
                    property&quot; &#8212; a principle just the reverse of the
                    correct one, for the man who makes land productive adds to
                    the general prosperity, while the man who keeps land unproductive
                    stands in the way of the general prosperity, is but a dog-in-the-manger,
                    who prevents others from using what he will not use himself.</p>
                  <p>Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a
                    public benefit no one will dispute. We want more railroads,
                    and want them to reduce their fares and freight. Why then
                    should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads deter from railroad
                    building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing the
                    railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the
                    increased value which they give to land? To tax railroads
                    is to check railroad building, to reduce profits, and compel
                    higher rates; to tax the value they give to land is to increase
                    railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated railroads,
                    for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of
                    New York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the
                    island. But this great public benefit is neutralized by the
                    rise in land values. Because these vacant lots can be reached
                    more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for them,
                    and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while
                    the roads lose the business they would get were not building
                    checked by the high prices demanded for lots. The increase
                    of land values, which the elevated roads have caused, is
                    not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
                    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads
                    ought not to be taxed. The more profit they make, with the
                    better conscience can they be asked to still further reduce
                    fares. It is the increased land values which they have created
                    that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
                    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
                  <p>So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads,
                    but with all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider
                    that community most prosperous which increases most rapidly
                    in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity for us to
                    tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax
                    what we want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We
                    should tax that which results from the general prosperity,
                    not that which conduces to it. It is the increase of population,
                    the extension of cultivation, the manufacture of goods, the
                    building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
                    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value
                    of land &#8212; not the increase in the value of land that
                    induces the increase of population and increase of wealth.
                    It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now worth
                    hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch
                    settlers, it was only worth dollars, that there are on it
                    now so many more people, and so much more wealth. It is because
                    of the increase of population and the increase of wealth
                    that the value of the land has so much increased. Increase
                    of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent
                    improvement. And thus the taxation of land values, unlike
                    taxation of other property, does not tend to prevent the
                    increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate it. It is the
                    taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
                    lays it.</p>
                  <p>Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this
                    conclusion. The tax upon land values is the most economically
                    perfect of all taxes. It does not raise prices; it maybe
                    collected at least cost, and with the utmost ease and certainty;
                    it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
                    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and
                    the highest justice. For, to take for the common purposes
                    of the community that value which results from the growth
                    of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
                    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that
                    which he fairly earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive
                    of equal rights &#8212; the equal right of all to the land
                    on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to
                    the greatest production is also that which conduces to the
                    fairest distribution, and that in the proper adjustment of
                    taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously increasing
                    the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
                    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality
                    in the distribution of wealth.</p>
                  <p>&quot;There is,&quot; says M. de Laveleye, in concluding
                    that work in which he shows that the first perceptions of
                    mankind have everywhere recognized a most vital distinction
                    between property in land and property which results from
                    labor, &#8212; &quot;there is in human affairs one system
                    which is the best; it is not that system which always exists,
                    otherwise why should we desire to change it; but it is that
                    system which should exist for the greatest good of humanity.
                    God knows it, and wills it; man's duty it is to discover
                  and establish it.&quot; ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole

      <p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
      <p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every
        wheel of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like
        removing an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh
        energy, production would start into new life, and trade would receive
        a stimulus which would be felt to the remotest arteries. The present
        method of taxation operates upon exchange like artificial deserts and
        mountains;</p>
      <ul>
        <li> it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to
          carry them around the world.</li>
        <li> It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like
          a fine upon those qualities.</li>
        <li> If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you
          have been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually
          to make me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more
          than you.</li>
        <li> If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
        <li> If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though
          he had done an injury to the state;</li>
        <li> if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as
          though it were a public nuisance;</li>
        <li> if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which
          would go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
        <li> We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it
          among us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.</li>
        <li> We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
          grain,</li>
        <li> we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have
        attempted to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications,
        for, as I have before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which
        falls in increased prices.</p>
      <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of
        taxation from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the
        great manufactory; the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat
        and the steamship; the farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would
        be alike untaxed. All would be free to make or to save, to buy or to
        sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed by the taxgatherer. Instead of saying
        to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The more you add to the general
        wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the state would say to the
        producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising as you
        choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall not be fined for making
        two blades of grass grow where one grew before; you shall not be taxed
        for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
      <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that
        lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth
        out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their
        natural reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also
        a natural reward. The law of society is, each for all, as well as all
        for each. No one can keep to himself the good he may do, any more than
        he can keep the bad. Every productive enterprise, besides its return
        to those who undertake it, yields collateral advantages to others. If
        a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers the fruit in its
        time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain to the
        whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
        supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain
        which it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to
        the eye which rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty.
        And so with everything else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship,
        or a railroad, benefits others besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
      <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts
        him to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of
        his labor, and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the
        more that labor and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth
        in which all may share. And in the value or rent of land is this general
        gain expressed in a definite and concrete form. Here is a fund which
        the state may take while leaving to labor and capital their full reward.
        With increased activity of production this would commensurately increase.</p>
      <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to
        the value or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to
        the production of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For
        under this system no one would care to hold land unless to use it, and
        land now withheld from use would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
      <p>The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive
        its death blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and
        millions of acres from which settlers are now shut out by high prices
        would be abandoned by their present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal
        terms. And this not merely on the frontiers, but within what are now
        considered well settled districts.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land
            cannot be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by
            all competent economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons
            untrained in economics. The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is
            that it cannot limit the supply of land. Landowners are presumably,
            before the tax is laid, charging all the rent they can get. There
            is nothing in a tax on the rental value of land to make tenants willing
            to pay more or to make land more difficult to hire. On the contrary,
            more land will be on the market, because of such a tax, rather than
            less, since the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding land out of use
            and unimproved for mere speculation. The competition of former vacant
            land speculators to get their land used will make land cheaper to
            rent rather than more expensive. And since only the net rent remaining
            after the tax is subtracted is capitalized into salable value, land
            will be very much cheaper to buy. H.G.B.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
        land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just
        as agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford
        to keep land from its most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand
        more for it than the use to which it could at the time be put would warrant.
        Everywhere that land had attained a value, taxation, instead of operating,
        as now, as a fine upon improvement, would operate to force improvement.
        Whoever planted an orchard, or sowed a field, or built a house, or erected
        a manufactory, no matter how costly, would have no more to pay in taxes
        than if he kept so much land idle.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though
          his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with stock.</li>
        <li> The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the
          privilege of keeping other people off of it until he wanted to use
          it, as his neighbor who has a fine house upon his lot.</li>
        <li> It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon
          valuable land as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile
          of great warehouses filled with costly goods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid
        before labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage
          his labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
        <li> the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much
          for a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
        <li> the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have
          to expend a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
        <li> And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in
          lieu of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and
          stock.
            <p><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional
                economists, have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension
                of this point. Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced
                that the greater cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor
                man who is trying to save enough from his earnings to buy a piece
                of land; for, it is said, the higher taxes on the land after
                it is acquired, offset the lower purchase price. What such objectors
                do not see is that even if the lower price of land does no more
                than balance the higher tax on it, (and this overlooks, for one
                thing, the discouragement to speculation in land), the reduction
                or removal of other taxes is all clear gain. It is easier to
                save in proportion as earnings and commodities are relieved of
                taxation. It is easier to buy land, because its selling price
                is lower, if the land is taxed. And although the land, after
                its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can this tax be
                fully paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the purchase
                price, but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on
                buildings and other improvements and in whatever other taxes
                are thus rendered unnecessary. H.G.B.</font></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
        would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with
        each other for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages
        to the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing
        for laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For
        into the labor market would have entered the greatest of all competitors
        for the employment of labor, a competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied
        until want is satisfied &#8212; the demand of labor itself. The employers
        of labor would not have merely to bid against other employers, all feeling
        the stimulus of greater trade and increased profits, but against the
        ability of laborers to become their own employers upon the natural opportunities
        freely opened to them by the tax which prevented monopolization.</p>
      <p> With natural opportunities thus free to labor;</p>
      <ul>
        <li> with capital and improvements exempt from tax, and exchange released
          from restrictions, the spectacle of willing men unable to turn their
          labor into the things they are suffering for would become impossible;</li>
        <li> the recurring paroxysms which paralyze industry would cease;</li>
        <li> every wheel of production would be set in motion;</li>
        <li> demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with demand;</li>
        <li> trade would increase in every direction, and wealth augment on every
          hand. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the

                          so far from being taxed and fined for having done these things,
                          we ought to be glad that he has done it; that we ought to welcome
                          all energy; that no man can produce wealth for himself without
                          augmenting the general stock, without making the whole country
                          richer. We impose some taxes for the purpose of getting rid
                          of things, for the purpose of having fewer of the things that
                          we tax. In most of our counties and States when dogs become
                          too numerous, there is imposed a dog tax to get rid of dogs.
                          Well, we impose a dog tax to get rid of dogs, and why should
                          we impose a house tax unless we want to get rid of houses?
                          Why should we impose a farm tax unless we want fewer farms?
                          Why should we tax any man for having exerted industry or energy
                          in the production of wealth? </p>

      <p> Tax houses and there will certainly be fewer houses. If you
                          go east to the city of Brooklyn, you may see that demonstrated
                          to the eye. What first surprised me in the city of churches
                          was to see long rows of buildings, of brown-stone houses, two
                          stories in front and three stories behind; or three stories
                          in front and four stories behind; and I thought for a moment
                          what foolish idea ever entered the brains of those men, to
                          have left out half an upper story in that way? I found out
                          by inquiring that it was all on account of tax. In the city
                          of Brooklyn, the assessor is only supposed to look in front,
                          and so by making the house in that way, you can get a three-story
                          building behind with only a two-story front and a two-story
                          tax. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p> So in England, in the old houses, there you may see the
        result of the window tax. The window tax is in force in France today,
                              and in France there are two hundred thousand houses,
        according to the census, that have no window at all &#8212; in order
                              to escape the tax. </p>
    </div>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p> So if you tax ships there will be fewer ships. What old San
                          Franciscan cannot remember the day when in this harbour might
                          be seen the graceful forms and lofty spars of so many American
                          ships, the fleetest and best in the world? I well remember
                          the day that no American who crossed to Europe thought of crossing
                          on any other than an American ship. Today, if you wish to cross
                          the Atlantic, you must cross on a British steamer, unless you
                          choose to cross on a German or French steamer. On the high
                          seas of the world the American ship is becoming almost as rare
                          as a Chinese junk. Why? Simply because we have taxed our ships
                          out of existence. There is the proof. </p>

      <p> Tax buildings, and you will have fewer or poorer buildings;
                          tax farms, and you will have fewer farms and more wilderness;
                          tax ships, there will be fewer and poorer ships; and
      tax capital, and there will be less capital; but you may tax land values
                          all you please and there will not he a square inch
      the less
                          land. Tax land values all you please up to the point
      of taking the full annual value &#8212; up to the point of making mere
                          ownership in land utterly unprofitable, so that no one will
                          want merely to own land &#8212; what will be the result? Simply
                          that land will be the easier had by the user. Simply that the
                          land will become valueless to the mere speculator &#8212; to
                          the dog in the manger, who wants merely to hold and
                          not to use; to the forestaller, who wants merely to
                          reap where others
                          have sown, to gather to himself the products of labour,
                          without doing labour. Tax land values, and you leave
                          to production
                          its full rewards, and you open to producers natural

      <p> Take it from any aspect you please, take it on its political

        consider clearly and plainly), while we boast of our democratic

            Look at the corruption that is tearing the heart out of our institutions;
            where does it come from? Whence this demoralisation? Largely from
            our system of taxation.
            What does our present system of taxation do? Why, it is a tax upon
            conscience; a tax upon truth; a tax upon respect for law. It offers
            a premium for lying
            and perjury and evasion. It fosters and stimulates
            bribery and corruption.

        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A VERY common objection to the
          proposition to concentrate all taxes on Land Values is that the
          landowner would add the increased tax on the value of his land to the
          rent that must be paid by his tenants. It is this notion that increased
          Taxation of Land Values would fall upon the users, not upon the owners
          of land, that more perhaps than anything else prevents men from seeing
          the far-reaching and beneficent effects of doing away with the taxes
          that now fall upon labor or the products of labor, and taking for
          public use those values that attach to land by reason of the growth and
          progress of society. </small><br>
          <br>
          <small>That taxes levied upon Land Values, or, to use the
          politico-economic term, taxes levied upon rent, do not fall upon the
          user of land, and cannot be transferred by the landlord to the tenant
          is conceded by all economists of reputation. However much they may
          dispute as to other things, there is no dispute upon this point.
          Whatever flimsy reasons any of them may have deemed it expedient to
          give why the tax on rent should not be more resorted to, they all admit
          that the taxation of rent merely diminishes the profits of the
          landowner, cannot be shifted on the user of land, cannot add to prices,
          nor check production.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>... The rent of land represents a return to ownership
          over and above the return which is sufficient to induce use &#8212; it
          is a premium paid for permission to use. To take, in taxation, a part
          or the whole of this premium in no way affects the incentive to use
          or the return to use; in no way diminishes the amount of land there
          is to use, or makes it more difficult to obtain it for use. Thus
          there is no way in which a tax upon rent or Land Values can be
          transferred to the user. Whatever the State may demand of this
          premium simply diminishes the net amount which ownership can get for
          the use of land, or the price it can demand as purchase money, which
          is, of course, rent or the expectation of rent, capitalized. ...<a

                of cities? There is no natural reason. Take New York, one half its area
                is not built upon. Why, then,
          must people crowd together as they do there? Simply because of private
          ownership of land. There is plenty of room to build houses and plenty
          of people who want to build houses, but before anybody can build a
          house a blackmail price must be paid to some dog in the manger. It
          costs in many cases more to get vacant ground upon which to build a
          house than it does to build the house. And then what happens to the man
          who pays this blackmail and builds a house? Down comes the tax-gatherer
          and fines him for building the house.</small><br>

          <small>It is so all over the United States &#8212; the men who improve, the
          men who turn the prairie into farms and the desert into gardens, the
          men who beautify your cities, are taxed and fined for having done these
          things. Now, nothing is clearer than that the people of New York want
          more houses; and I think that even here in Burlington you could get
          along with more houses. Why, then, should you fine a man who builds
          one? Look all over this country &#8212; the bulk of the taxation rests upon
          the improver; the man who puts up a building, or establishes a factory,
          or cultivates a farm he is taxed for it; and not merely taxed for it,
          but I think in nine cases out of ten the land which he uses, the bare
          land, is taxed more than the adjoining lot or the adjoining 160 acres
          that some speculator is holding as a mere dog in the manger, not using
          it himself and not allowing anybody else to use it. ... <a

          exchanges for a large portion of the continent? Does not every child
          that is born, every one that comes to settle in New York, does it not
          add to the value of this land? Ought it not, therefore, get some

          bribery, and corruption, which lead men into temptation, and which tax
          what the nation can least afford to spare -- honesty and conscience.
          Since land lies out-of-doors and cannot be removed, and its value is
          the most readily ascertained of all values, the tax to which we would

<blockquote>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  <p><strong>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
    of what some have to sell and others must buy.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
    it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
    sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
    and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to
    do.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
    thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest
    division of wealth.</strong></p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
    of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
    octroi <strong>duties</strong> that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous <strong>customs
    duties</strong> that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states;<strong> the
    taxes on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses,
    on
    the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms.</strong> Can these
    be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
    need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
    deem a right one?</p>
  <p><strong><em>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
    the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
    scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
    price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
    they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
    thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
    others.</em></strong></p>
  <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
    of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
  <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
    are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
    that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
    the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
    effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
    buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
    gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
    of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
    sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
    it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
    of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
    instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
    of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
  <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
    show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
    intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
  <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
    a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
  <p><strong>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose
      to tax, the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from
      any exertion
    of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
    in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt.</strong> The value
    of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
    reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
    always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
    user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
    pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
    the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
    or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
    to be a user.</p>
  <p><strong>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the
      rewards of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
    what belongs to the individual. </strong>They can take only the value that attaches
    to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
    community as a whole.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
        are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
        what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
        from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
        for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
        be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
        in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
        will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
        as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
        determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
        the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
        increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
        cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
        or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
        in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
        recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
        cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
        Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
          by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
          and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
          can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
        2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what
        the particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may
        be had by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage
        and for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
        3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
        in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
        social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
        withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
        be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
        the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
        land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
        because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
        economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
        were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
        since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
        of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
        receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
        demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
        to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
        were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
        for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
        merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
    of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
    to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
    impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
    it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
    by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
    artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
    that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
    most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
    enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
    temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
    innocent.</strong></p>
  <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
    needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
    of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
    nourishment of the babe.</p>
  <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
    the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
    but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
    But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
    necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
    begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
    more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
    time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
    The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
    since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
    steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
    centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
    Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
    of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
    due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
    cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
    streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
    health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
    of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
    the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
    improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
    law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
    anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
    values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
  <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
    and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
    If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
    with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
    the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
    us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
    that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
  <p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one thing
    that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue of which
    all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general improvements
    of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the
    dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
    Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
    is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it
    not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
    while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with the
    advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each member
    of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from
    his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen
    relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
    the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
    the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
    should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater
    equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
    an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>THE mere abolition of protection &#8212; the mere substitution of a revenue
    tariff for a protective tariff &#8212; is such a lame and timorous application
    of the free-trade principle that it is a misnomer to speak of it as free
    trade. A revenue tariff is only a somewhat milder restriction on trade than
    a protective tariff.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Free trade, in its true meaning, requires not merely the abolition of protection
but the sweeping away of all tariffs &#8212; the abolition of all restrictions
(save those imposed in the interests of public health or morals) on the bringing
of things into a country or the carrying of things out of a country. <br>
            <br>
But free trade cannot logically stop with the abolition of custom-houses. It
applies as well to domestic as to foreign trade, and in its true sense requires
the abolition of all internal taxes that fall on buying, selling, transporting
or exchanging, on the making of any transaction or the carrying on of any business,
save of course where the motive of the tax is public safety, health or morals.
Thus the adoption of true free trade involves the abolition of all indirect taxation
of whatever kind, and the resort to direct taxation for all public revenues. <br>
            <br>
But this is not all. Trade, as we have seen, is a mode of production, and the
freeing of trade is beneficial because it is a freeing of production. For the
same reason, therefore, that we ought not to tax anyone for adding to the wealth
of a country by bringing valuable things into it, we ought not to tax anyone
for adding to the wealth of a country by producing within that country valuable
things. Thus the principle of free trade requires that we should not merely abolish
all indirect taxes, but that we should abolish as well all direct taxes on things
that are the produce of labor; that we should, in short, give full play to the
natural stimulus to production &#8212; the possession and enjoyment of the things
produced &#8212; by imposing no tax whatever upon the production, accumulation
or possession of wealth (the things produced by labor), leaving everyone free
to make exchange, give, spend or bequeath. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter
26: True Free Trade - <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT26.html">econlib</a> -|- <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/trade/pft20.htm">abridged</a>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>TO abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
    of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
    an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
    would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would
    be felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates
    upon exchange like artificial deserts and mountains; it costs more to get
    goods through a custom house than it does to carry them around the world.
    It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a fine
    upon those qualities. If I have worked harder and built myself a good house
    while you have been contented to live in a hovel, the tax-gatherer now comes
    annually to make me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me
    more than you. If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are
    exempt. If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though
    he had done an injury to the state; if a railroad be opened, down comes the
    tax collector upon it, as though it were a public nuisance; if a manufactory
    be erected, we levy upon it an annual sum which would go far towards making
    a handsome profit. We say we want capital, but if anyone accumulate it, or
    bring it among us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.
    We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening grain;
    we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>AND will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that
    lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth
    out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
    reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural
    reward. The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No
    one can keep to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the
    bad. Every productive enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake
    it, yields collateral advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree,
    his gain is that he gathers the fruit in its time and season. But in addition
    to his gain, there is a gain to the whole community. Others than the owner
    are benefited by the increased supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters
    fly far and wide; the rain which it helps to attract falls not alone on his
    field; and, even to the eye which rests upon it from a distance, it brings
    a sense of beauty. And so with everything else. The building of a house,
    a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others besides those who get the
    direct profits. Nature laughs at a miser. He is like the squirrel who buries
    his nuts and refrains from digging them up again. Lo! they sprout and grow
    into trees. In fine linen, steeped in costly spices, the mummy is laid away.
    Thousands and thousands of years thereafter, the Bedouin cooks his food by
    a fire of its encasings, it generates the steam by which the traveler is
    whirled on his way, or it passes into far-off lands to gratify the curiosity
    of another race. The bee fills the hollow tree with honey, and along comes
    the bear or the man. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>CONSIDER the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
    would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with
    each other for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to
    the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for
    laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the
    labor market would have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment
    of labor, a competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
    demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to bid
    against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade and increased
    profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
    upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented
    monopolization. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html"> &#8212; Book

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Instead of recognizing the
virtues of tapping geo-rent, they only point
to a possible imperfection, such as that somebody who enjoys a local
park will own a tiny lot nearby and pay a land tax lower than his share
of the cost. This, say Cornes and Sandler (367), is a "perverse
incentive." But such free riding is rampant with income and sales
taxes, in which tax payments have hardly a gossamer relation to any
benefit. Tapping geo-rent is being judged in isolation by the standard
of perfect efficiency, rather than in comparison to other means of
taxing people to pay for collective goods. This &#8220;perverse incentive&#8221;
proposition is also made in an institutional vacuum. In practice, as
Hamilton (1975) points out, rules can mitigate the problem. City lots
tend to have a uniform size, either with zoning or with covenants.
Moreover, much of the utility of dwellers comes from complementarities,
from the lot and improvements (house and garden) as well as from a set
of civic services, so as analyzed by Ellickson (1971), heterogeneous
utilities are of little empirical significance....</small><span

<blockquote>
  <p>An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm land.
      Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot centrally
      located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by, say, Mr. John
      William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom.
      It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.
      There is a little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure
      ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
      subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's
      growth in which the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
      in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to, say,
      two hundred times its early value.</p>
  <p>About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and can't
      be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure of population
      is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public money to the benefit
      of this land must continue, he will not sell it. So he gives a twenty-one year
      lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a year net, with a privilege to the lessee
      of renewals at advancing figures. The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.</p>
  <p>Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which will be regularly remitted to
    Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever he may be, given in payment for? Not
    for
      the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does is to pull it down.
      Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock, which has got to be blasted
      out as part of its improvement.</p>
  <p>Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community, and
      the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the present
      $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command in later
      years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs to the community
      and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>
  <p>That the latter has no good right to it is at once evident when we remember
      that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody else has got to
      give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000 that some men and women
      have got to work to earn every year to hand over to a man who does not
      render, and does not feel any obligation to render, one dollar's worth
      of public or
      private service in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice which we
      call law. It is not comical only because it is frankly tragic in its social
      results.</p>
  <p>Now suppose this $20,000 and all the rest of this same community product &#8212; i.e.,
      the site or location rent of its ground &#8212; were paid every year to
      its rightful owner, the treasurer of New York City, what would become of
      taxation,
      with its inseparable retinue, Fraud, Evasion, Perjury, Inequality, and
      an all-pervading public sense of injustice?</p>
  <p>An authority on municipal taxation estimates the present economic rent of
      the land embraced in the City of New York at from $350,000,000 to $400,000,000.
      Assuming the lesser of these figures and adding the receipts from licenses,
      fees and fines, New York City should receive, of her own income, enough to
      pay all her own legitimate bills, to make her proper contributions to county
      and state and build a new subway or its equivalent every year.</p>
  <p>And this with nobody paying a dollar of taxes, or, if we except the fines,
      a dollar that he was not ready and glad to pay for his own advantage.</p>
  <p>We repeat, this is not taxation; but for the sake of those who cannot grasp
      the idea of public revenue without taxation, let us state the matter in their
      own language.</p>
  <p>Think of a tax which both assesses itself and collects itself, which burdens
      no one, which is paid voluntarily, and only by those who do so for their
    own profit or other advantage. Compare this with our present system of taxes,
    which
      everyone despises, which can be collected in full only from the very scrupulous
      and from the helpless, from trust funds of widows and orphans, or from
    estates which lie naked before the tax gatherer on the records of court;
    a system which
      drives men of property from state to state and town to town in flight from
      the assessor, and well-nigh forces many worthy citizens to practices of
    evasion which must make it hard for them to look into their own mirrors during
    the
      season for &quot;Correction of Assessments;&quot; there can be but one
      verdict upon such comparison.</p>
  <p>But again the voice of the objector is heard, possibly to this effect: &quot;This
      plan may be all right for the community, but how about poor Mr. Rhinelastor?&quot;</p>
  <p>In reality the landowner would not suffer so much from the restoration of
      the public revenue as might at first appear. For one thing, whereas he is now
      taxed, at least in theory, not only on land, but on buildings, cash, bonds,
      and all other personal property, and perhaps on his income as well, he would
      then have no taxes at all to pay. Furthermore the economic rent is not the
      full measure of the possible earning capacity of the land, but will always
      be less than the offerer expects to make out of its use.</p>
  <p>Again, while it must be firmly insisted that the economic rent is the rightful
      property of the community and not of the landowner, the community would probably
      never take it all. Communal ownership of land is not desirable, even if it
      were practicable. Individual ownership and management are best, and it is not
      at all improper for the community to allow the owner something for caring for
      the land to which he holds title, and for collecting and transmitting to the
      treasury the economic rent.</p>
  <p>But &#8212; and right here is one of the prime advantages of the abolition
      of taxation &#8212; Mr. Rhinelastor, in order to get satisfactory return
      from his land, must improve it. Unless he is satisfied with a small income
      from
      it, to wit, the proportion of the economic rent which the community chooses
      to leave in his hands, he must put upon his land the best building the
      location will warrant. The rents of this building will be his in their
      entirety, not
      one dollar of them being taken from him by taxation. If he is not prepared
      or not willing to do this he would probably find it more profitable, before
      he leaves the country, to sell the land to some one of the many persons
      who are eager to build upon it. It will always be salable, although not
      by any
      means at present figures.</p>
  <p>Now imagine for a moment the effect upon the appearance of a city and upon
      the comfort of its population which would result from the change of fiscal
      policy which this article proposes. <strong>At present, a tempting premium
      is placed upon keeping land unimproved or inadequately improved, while a heavy
      penalty
      is imposed upon improvement.</strong> Most land appreciates constantly. All buildings
      depreciate from the moment of completion. Yet the building is taxed equally
      with the land.</p>
  <p><strong>What incentive does such a system offer the speculative landowner
        to put up a commodious, well-lighted modern structure in place of the old
        ruin which
      now pays him so well? </strong>The old one cannot depreciate much more, and
      while paying a trifling tax because of its physical worthlessness, he is thereby
      enabled
      to collect and pocket the economic rent of the ground, which the community
      is continually rendering more valuable. The new building would absorb a large
      amount of capital, would begin to run down even before it could be occupied,
      and would be taxed to the limit. Why then is not the landlord justified in
      letting well enough alone, enjoying the growing economic rent, and waiting
      till he can get a fancy price for the right to collect it? ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... If land holders can produce a
higher return on investment by not
using land for productive purposes but rather hold it for a higher
price from those willing and able to pay the higher price in the
future, there is a flaw in public policy. Public policy thereby gives
speculative, nonproductive investment a higher return than productive
investment. Sprawl is subsidized by taxes on production and
distribution and the failure to recapture the benefits resulting from
public improvements. If we choose to end this subsidy, we would
reduce sprawl.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One example that I know is that of
a friend who bought land within
the city but did nothing with it. I asked him why he put good money
into an investment that had no visible return? He replied that, by
holding the land for future sale or development, his long term
return, in capital gains would exceed 18% annually. If he built a
building on the site now, his long term return would only be 12%
annually, including both net income plus capital gains. Why should he
use his land now when it would be more profitable for him to not use
it, but to hold it for a larger future gain?</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most major cities have a
substantial amount of fully serviced but
unused or underused land sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is needed is a continuously
self-renewing city and a public
policy that can work effectively. Buildings have a limited useful
life. Continuous maintenance and frequent retrofitting sometimes
extends this life span. Other buildings reach a point where they
should be replaced. Some buildings sit vacant for decades even in the
city's central business district. Valuable parcels of land are left
undeveloped or paved over and used as surface parking lots. The
result is a lower tax base and an eyesore.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As urban buildings deteriorate,
owners often don't renovate,
remodel or make repairs because their property tax may rise. Thus the
typical property tax creates suburban sprawl and urban decay.
Shifting the property tax off buildings and onto land reverses these
processes. Taxing land more than buildings usually reduces taxes for
homeowners.&nbsp; ... <a

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, what is the effect on
production of taxes levied on
products and of taxes levied on the value of land? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of taxes levied on products,
George said: "The present method of
taxation operates upon exchange like artificial deserts and
mountains; it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it
does to carry them around the world. It operates upon energy, and
industry, and skill, and thrift, like a fine upon those qualities. If
I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually
to make me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me
more than you. If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while
you are exempt. If a man build a ship we make him pay for his
temerity, as though he had done an injury to the state; if a railroad
be opened, down comes the taxcollector upon it, as though it were a
public nuisance; if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an
annual sum which would go far toward making a handsome profit. We say
we want capital, but if anyone accumulate it, or bring it among us,
we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege. We
punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
grain, we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.
How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have
attempted to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications,
for, as I have before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that
which falls in increased prices."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turning to taxation levied on the
value of land, George went on to
say: </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For this simple device of placing
all taxes on the value of land
would be in effect putting up the land at auction to whosoever would
pay the highest rent to the state. The demand for land fixes its
value, and hence, if taxes were placed so as very nearly to consume
that value, the man who wished to hold land without using it would
have to pay very nearly what it would be worth to anyone who wanted
to use it. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And it must be remembered that
this would apply, not merely to
agricultural land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open
to use, just as agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one
could afford to keep land from its most profitable use, or on the
outskirts to demand more for it than the use to which it could at the
time be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had attained a value,
taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
would operate to force improvement. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A few pages before this he had
told us that, "It is sufficiently
evident that with regard to production, the tax upon the value of
land is the best tax that can be imposed. Tax manufactures, and the
effect is to check manufacturing; tax improvements, and the effect is
to lessen improvement; tax commerce, and the effect is to prevent
exchange; tax capital, and the effect is to drive it away. But the
whole value of land may be taken in taxation, and the only effect
will be to stimulate industry, to open new opportunities to capital,
and to increase the production of wealth."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In other words, according to
George, taxation of products checks
production, whereas taxation of land values stimulates production.... <a

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Tenets.html">Basic Tenets of the
Incentive Taxation Philosophy</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Creating a More
Productive Economy</b>
</small><br>
<small>The ideas we espouse are attractive not only for their
embodiment
of principles of justice, but also because they can be expected to
lead to a more productive economy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists agree that the
imposition of taxes generally retards an
economy. The reason for this is that with almost all taxes, it is
possible for a tax payer to reduce total tax collections by doing
less of whatever is taxed--work less, spend less, save less, etc.
This means that taxes generate an incentive to be less
productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With fees for the use of
government-assigned opportunities, on the
other hand, the only thing that a person can do to reduce the amount
of money that he or she pays is to use fewer of these opportunities.
But then the opportunities can be used by someone else, who will pay
the fees, and total public revenue will be unchanged. There is no
possibility reducing total government revenue by being less
productive. Thus these fees can be collected without dragging down
the economy in the way that existing taxes do.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our ideas provide for the natural
financing of any worthwhile
public expenditure that makes a particular area more attractive or
productive--parks, freeways, subways, sewer systems, etc. These
public expenditures raise the rental value of land in their vicinity,
and thereby raise the fees that can be collected for using the land.
If the activity is worthwhile, the increase in rental values will be
sufficient to pay for the activity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another way in which our ideas
promote a more efficient economy is
by eliminating the opportunity grow rich by having government promote
one's own interest at the expense of others. Such distortions of the
political process can occur either by persuading a government agency
to spend money in a way that raises the value of land that one owns
while others foot the bill, or by persuading a government agency to
prohibit others from doing what one is permitted to do. In both kinds
of cases, the person who promotes his or her own interest has no
reason to take account of the costs that are thereby imposed on
others, and typically these costs to others are greater than the
self-seeking benefits. This makes the economy less productive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, the very possibility
of growing rich by manipulating
government action draws talented people into the effort to manipulate
government decisions, when they could be employed doing something
useful.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp; </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Making Housing
Affordable</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The implementation of our ideas
would have a dramatic effect in
making housing more affordable. The principal reason why housing
costs have risen so much is that the price of land has risen
enormously. Some increase in the price of access to land is a natural
accompaniment of an increasing population.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the very great increases of
recent years, which have made it
nearly impossible for young families to afford houses of their own,
have additional causes. The implementation of our ideas would bring
down the price of access to land in three ways.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First,
much land is held off the market by speculators who may wait
generations do decide to develop it.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The introduction of a fee for
holding land, whether used or not, equal to the rental value of the
land, will induce speculators to either develop this land themselves or
turn it over to someone who will.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, an important cause of
higher prices for access to land by those who wish to build low-cost
housing is zoning restrictions. </span>These restrictions are
introduced by political factions that already have their houses and do
not mind if housing becomes scarcer. It just raises the market value of
their homes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But if a rise
in land values were accompanied by rises in the fees that existing
residents had to pay for the use of the land on which their houses sit,
they would have an incentive to do what they could to make land
plentiful rather than scarce, and zoning restrictions could be expected
to diminish.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third, a person who wishes to
own a house must borrow money to cover the price of buying the title to
the land on which the house sits as well as the cost of the house
itself. </span>If the use of land required the payment of a fee equal
to the rental value of land, so that the selling price of land titles
became virtually zero, then the amount of money that a family would
have to borrow to purchase a house would fall. ...&nbsp; <a

<small>VI. Conclusion: A greater perspective</small><br>
<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">LVT's foundation of detailed
land use
assessments will also help expose the true costs of subsidies for
natural resources, which effectively amount to negative eco-taxes.</span>
Subsidies come in all shapes and sizes, often barely visible, and
urgently need to be exposed and evaluated. Even some harmful subsidies
which are labeled land taxes have nothing to do with genuine LVT. Banks
gives the example of a Brazilian tax which was levied on unimproved
land but was reduced by up to 90% on land used for crops or pasture.
Forests were classified as unimproved land and were therefore taxed at
the full rate, which induced settlers to chop down the trees to reduce
their tax liability."<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The whole field of eco-taxes cannot be viewed in isolation of
the
fiscal imperatives to raise sufficient public finance, and here we see
another of the virtues of LVT. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">If
people were required to pay the rental value of most natural resources
they used (as many, in fact, already do - to private owners) an
adjustment in patterns of consumption would follow. The environmental
goals would be achieved - at the cost of fiscal goals.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>However, under our present fiscal regime, governments are locked
into a
dependency on revenue from socially-harmful sources such as tobacco and
gambling, and cannot raise the taxes on them to levels that would "kill
the golden goose". Would such political realities change with
eco-taxes? Because of the inherent problem with most eco-taxes that
they reduce consumption of natural resources and therefore the tax
base, they give rise to a financial inducement to hold the tax rate at
a low enough rate so that a degree of pollution and wasteful
consumption can continue.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The effects of conventional eco-taxes sharply contrast with LVT
which instead is a <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">renewable
and naturally-escalating source of revenue</span>
which arises when people are willing to pay for the use of land the
value of which is enhanced by natural resources which sustain healthy
lives. In other words, the success of a cleaner and more secure
environment would feed through to the land market, which measures the
attraction of the natural environment for living and working. Because
people are willing to pay higher rents for such benefits LVT, instead
of eroding revenue, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">expands the public's
revenue base so that everybody enjoys the benefits of cleaning up and
conserving the natural environment.</span> Under the current system of
land tenure, the financial benefits of a cleaner environment accrue to
landowners.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What happens when a state
radically
slashes its property tax?
Michiganders are saying they must wait and see, but there is no need
for that: California can show you 17 years of experience. To read
your future, just study our past. Here is what has happened since
California passed Proposition 13 in 1978. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
should give one pause. It is the
expectable consequence of what
the voters did. They rejected the concept of taxing inert wealth in
favor of the alternative: taxing liquidity, cash flow, work,
production and commerce. </span>The predictable result has been to
inhibit
economic activity, and encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.
They turned property from a functional concept into a sacred one;
from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce goods, and
pay taxes into a welfare entitlement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The invisible, pervasive change is
due to Proposition 13, which
makes it possible to hold land at negligible tax cost. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In 1945 land
was taxed at 3 percent every year, building a fire under holdouts to
turn their land to use. Today that same tax cost is well below 1
percent. Using Gwartney's Rule of Thumb (see below under #2, A,
"Reassessing Land Frequently") it is about 1/8 of 1 percent: a rate
of 1 percent applied to 1/8 of the true value. 
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Landowners are only taxed now if
they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they are confronted by the
drag of our high business and employment and sales taxes,
necessitated by the fall of property taxes. A handful of
oligopolistic landowners control most of the market; small businesses
are squeezed out. This helps us segue from being at the cutting edge
of industrial progress to a third-world economy - from the NH model
to the AL model - with little relief in sight. </small><br>
<br>
<small>What was different then? We had high property tax rates, but
they
were more focused on land than now, less on new buildings. Another
obvious difference was the lower burdens of sales tax, business tax,
and income tax. California was more hospitable to Georgist thinking
than perhaps any other state, shown by its long run of Georgist
political action in the prior thirty years. Most people today are
totally ignnorant of this subject. It has been deleted from our
history books. Here is a brief review.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>... In California, where we used to have good assessment, we now
have
bad assessment legally mandated by Prop. 13. So long as land is
unsold, and/or not newly improved, its assessment rise is capped at 2
percent a year, while market prices soar.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>This is not the result of fractional assessment. In California
we
assess property at 100 percent when land changes ownership or there
is a new building. Rather, this is the result of Prop. 13 and its
prohibition of market reassessment until land sells. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Does this help you understand why
California landowners are now so
slow to adapt to new demands? In 1945 the assessors were building
fires under landowners, so they sought new strategies to meet new
circumstances. Today there remains a weak incentive to improve to
improve property: tax collectors generally cost them money when they
make improvements. Sit still, lie low, hire no one, hang on, produce
nothing, and your holding costs are negligible.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In spite of extreme
underassessment, the assessed value of taxable
land in California is 40 percent of the total real estate value.
Imagine what it would be if assessed values were real values,
"marked-to-market,'' as the law used to stipulate. It would be over
70 percent, as in 1917. "Staying power" would go down; land use, jobs
and production would rise. ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Urbanologists and the public need to be awakened to the central role
played by taxation. They need to see that loss of our historic land tax
has made speculation our top national sport -- a treacherous one at
that. As Hans Blumenthal wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">Metropolis...and
Beyond</span> (edited by fellow panelist on this program, architect
Paul Spreiregen):</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>
There is no doubt that the present real property tax...contributes more
to depressing the standard of housing than all government housing
policies combined do to raise it. The current property tax may fairly
be called the upside-down tax. It taxes land values too lightly,
buildings much too heavily. It rewards bad land use, penalizes good
land use. Consider three identical homes and lots:
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 1 adds a rec
room, new roof, great landscaping.</span> The
assessor comes by and says, in effect: "As punishment for making a
showplace, and for generating jobs and profits for local businesses,
we're raising your assessment by the amount of your investments. Your
tax bill will go up, not just for a year, but for as long as you keep
the house in good condition."</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 2 lets his
house of the same size run down -- loose
banisters, torn screens, broken gutters, junk-filled yard. </span>The
assessor
tells him, in effect: "Because you created an eyesore for your
neighbors and an unsafe dwelling for your tenants, we're reducing your
assessment and your taxes. If your place is more dilapidated next year,
we'll reduce them even more."</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 3 tears his
building down; the idle lot neither houses
nor employs anybody.</span> The friendly assessor tells him, in effect:
"For
completely wasting your property, and for making no use of the
infrastructure provided for this area, we'll give you the lowest
assessment and tax bill of the three."    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>These all-too-familiar examples
condemn not the assessor but our present tax system. And the same
perverse property tax incentives apply to commercial properties. Is it
any wonder cities are torn apart? The wretched tax on buildings is only
the half of it. The low land tax is the other half. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A speculator sees
that the annual increase in his or her land value is greater than the
tax bill. This signals the owner to do nothing, to sit back and collect
the values generated by productive neighbors and the community.</span></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Speculation
feeds on itself. The more land held out of use, the tighter
the supply of available sites.</span> This raises land prices further,
seducing more speculators into the land game, hastening the flight of
residents and businesses from central cities and even small towns. This
is far from the only cause of sprawl, but one of the most potent. It
cannot be stressed too much because it is one of the least recognized
causes. <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html"><span

rental apartments or commercial buildings, while it is reduced for
those who let their land go fallow. Compare the following situation of
the Joneses, the Smiths and the Greens.</small></font></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Joneses have
a well-maintained home. </span>The local
tax office, seeing that they have has added air conditioning, a
recreation room and a new roof, raises their assessment. Never mind
that the Joneses improved their neighborhood and generated jobs and
business. The result will be higher taxes not only this year, but as
long as they keep the house in good condition.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Smiths&#8217; home
of the same size and age is an
eyesore. </span>The yard is full of junk, gutters are rusted, screens
are
torn, paint is peeling. The tax office says it is worth less than last
year. The Smiths&#8217; taxes are reduced, a "reward" for blighting the
community.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Greens do
not use their lot at all. </span>They offer
no production or housing on it. For wasting the site&#8217;s potential, they
enjoy the lowest tax bill of the three.</small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Overtaxing
good land use while under-taxing blight
and empty lots invites slumlords and encourages land speculators. This

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The question I am assigned is
whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Non-property taxes, you know,
mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity. <strong>...</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Most California land, on the
other hand, is now taxed at
well below the allowable max of 1%</b>. <b>Speculators may sit on it
at little tax cost, however many highways and water and sewer lines
run to and past it, however many policemen are guarding it from
trespass.</b> Little wonder that California enterprise, once so
dynamic, flexible, and vital, is giving way to stasis and decay. We
used to lead the nation in making jobs; now in losing them. We used
to lead in school quality; now in jail population. 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When you tax land,
the market moves each owner to join it with labor and capital as a
vehicle for enterprise or shelter.</span>    </small></li>
  <li><small>When you untax it, the market
moves each owner to hold it more passively and obstructively as a
"store of value," like a dog burying a bone. The market not only
moves the sitting owners, it moves ownership itself to new owners
whose needs are compatible with the tax system you impose. <strong>...
    </strong></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Please understand, the
proposed tax change will not
produce an untempered rise of land prices. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxing land at a higher
rate balances and offsets the effect of exempting buildings. It tends
to lower land prices,</span> just as untaxing buildings tends to raise
them.
On balance, however, the positive effects on land prices will
outweigh the negative ones, because of the constructive incentive
effects of changing the tax base to land. Read on.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"What, then, will have
changed?", you might be asking. It's
a fair question. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's changed is
that your property tax is no
longer biased against renewal, against replacement of old by new</span>.
Neither is it biased against full development of the economic
capacity of each site. All the ground rents that are now aborted by
deferral of renewal, and by underdevelopment, will be generated by
new, full development. Land prices, your new tax base, will be pushed
up just by the expectation of new buildings' being tax free. The mere
expectation will immediately boost the value of land, your new city
tax base, even before the new buildings go up.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"How about corporate
stock?", I hear. "Should we exempt
corporate wealth from the property tax?" Actually, almost all
jurisdictions already exempt stock and all other "intangible"
property. Not to worry, however, you tax corporate assets. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When you
rank property owners by value of holdings, the top ten on most tax
rolls are all corporations. </span>None of their multi-national
profit-shifting through layered ownership of foreign subs, and
creative transfer pricing, can hide their taxable property on your
assessor's maps. This makes sense anyway. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Why should you think you
can tax a corporation for its business in Malaysia? What concerns you
is its property in your town. ...
</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;For example, in West Allis,
Wisconsin, the southwest corner
of the Allis-Chalmers plant occupies the northeast corner of the
100% location, the most valuable
commercial site in town. That land, with the same retail potential as
the other three corners, is assessed as raw industrial acreage, as
though it were in the boonies, with no recognition of its high
location value for retail/office use. To make a land tax work, the
assessor must be reinstructed to value that land at its highest and
best use rather than as ordinary raw acreage. Exempting buildings
would create the necessary pressure, thus solving the very problem
that otherwise might be taken as a point against it. As noted
earlier, the U.S. Census of Governments gives us no data on this
point. You, however, can find it easily enough: tax assessments are
public records, and you know your own town. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Another
attractive
feature of land taxation is its
interesting positive effect on the economic base of a city. It
strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder than
resident owners.</b> The land fraction in real estate is generally
highest in the CBD of any city, so that is a favorite place for
absentees to buy and hold. They like the steady income, and the
"trophy" quality. The surplus in real estate is what attracts outside
buyers, and land is what yields the surplus. <b>About 2/3 of downtown
Los Angeles is owned by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more
workaday city, Milwaukee, the absentee owners consist of former
residents, or their heirs, who grew too rich to abide the harsh
winters. ...&nbsp; </b><a style="font-weight: bold;"

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: normal;">Summary<br>
</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Common Property in Land is
Compatible with the Market
Economy.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To keep land common while shifting to a
market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
property takes in
a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
how; but in
the answers lie success or failure.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not
only can you have both common
land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
The very people who gave us the term laissez-faire -- the
slogan at the core of a
free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
central part of their
program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
Century, sometimes
called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
and who inspired land
reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
accurately called it the
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we have
learned to measure land values,
and we have broadened
the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
</span>Agrarians will be relieved,
and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
well down the
list in terms of total
market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
farms; only the very best
soils in the best locations yield much taxable
surplus.</span>&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small> Another natural resource (hence part of "land"), whose
nature and value the mass
of people are only slowly realizing, is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">radio
spectrum</span>. In this age of
communication its value is vaulting skywards even faster
than the rockets
launching the satellites that direct and relay signals
through the spectrum. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Each
satellite requires a spectrum assignment, or it is nothing
but space junk.</span> One
minor American entrepreneur, Craig McCaw, collected a
bundle of spectrum rights
for cell phones, and a few years ago sold them to AT&amp;T
for $12 billions. Then Mr.
McCaw went partners with Bill Gates, perhaps the richest
American, in a firm
called Teledesic, to launch hundreds of satellites and
amass radio spectrum
rights around the entire world, including your part of the
world, in the hope of
dominating worldwide communications. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radio
spectrum is a
natural resource, and
it belongs to the government, even in the capitalistic
U.S.A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Teledesic
comes calling, </span>under the auspices of our Vice President Al
Gore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't sell
anything cheap! In fact, don't sell anything at all, but
lease it for a limited time, so
you may gain from future rises in value.</span> And don't stint
on the professional help
you should hire to protect your interests: these lease
contracts are complex, and
are worth Billions if you play your cards right.
</span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Hydrocarbons are a third set
of valuable resources.</span> The
values involved are
gigantic. The recent merger of the Exxon and Mobil oil
firms was valued at $260
billions, several times greater than the Russian annual
budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should private
parties make off with all this natural value?</span> Several
nations, including some of your
neighbors, support themselves entirely from these
revenues. Norway pays for a
lush welfare state from its oil revenues. Its reserves are
so valuable that the mere
change in their appraised value in several recent years
has exceeded the entire
GDP of Norway. And your oil reserves? If they match your
production, they may
be the largest in the world.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>World oil prices are down this year, as you know, but
there is another side to this.
The devaluation of the ruble has raised the value of your
oil in Russian terms,
because the oil earns "hard" currency abroad. Your
government has recognized
this by imposing a special tax on the resulting
"windfall," but we will see below
(Sections 2,C and 2,D) that there is a much more effective
way to tax resource
rents.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The American state of Alaska
holds down its other taxes by
socializing part of its
oil revenues, which otherwise would inure to a handful of
the major stockholders of
two corporations (ARCO and BP). Alaska not only holds down
other taxes, it pays
each resident - man, woman, and child - a social dividend
of over $1,000 per year.</span>
Go thou and do likewise. Your expert, Dmitri Lvov from the
Russian Academy of
Sciences, a speaker at this meeting, has written that you
could cover most of
your national budget from your enormous production of oil
and gas.
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Many third-world nations like
Venezuela or Nigeria have
fabulous mineral oil that
they fail to exploit for their own people, letting
sophisticated or ruthless foreign
corporations, in tandem with weak or corrupt insiders,
reap the gains.</span> The
question for Russia is whether to follow their bad example
and become a poor
resource-colony of the west, or whether to assert your own
sovereignty over your
own resources for the benefit of your own people. You need
look no further than
Norway for a model.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Other subsoil resources have
great value, too.</span> Many
nations, even backward
ones, gain large parts of their national revenue from
"hardrock" minerals. Bolivia,
Gabon, Jamaica, Liberia, New Caledonia, Papua-New Guinea,
Zaire, and Zambia
have raised over 25% of their budgets this way in recent
years; Chile, Thailand
and Malaysia have taken lesser, but substantial amounts.
Saskatchewan, a
Canadian Province, raises large revenues from potash and
uranium; Minnesota, an
American state, from iron ore; and so on. Some other
nations fail to raise much
revenue from fabulous minerals from which others profit,
like S. Africa with its gold
and diamonds, West Virginia with its coal, or Missouri
with its lead mines and
reserves. Russia is a treasure-house of untapped mineral
wealth that you can and
should tax to alleviate the condition of the Russian
people.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> In arid lands, water is life,
and the most valuable
natural resource is water. </span>For
example, in southern California we need water so much we
import it from the
Feather River 600 miles north of us, pump it uphill
through the long San Joaquin
Valley, then over the high Tehachapi Mountain range, and
tunnel it through the
San Bernardino Mountain Range, all at great cost. When it
gets here, it
supplements and competes with local water that nature
provides freely in the
Santa Ana, San Jacinto, and other rivers. That local water
then has a value equal
to the high cost of importing the remote northern water.
That value in the local
waters is a taxable surplus. However, we have not learned
to take that surplus
value into the local treasuries; we give the water away,
and worse, we actually
subsidize people to withdraw water by helping them pay for
dams, canals, and
pipelines so they can waste water without paying for it.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus we turn a public
asset into a public liability - an extreme form of folly
that is called "dissipating
rent."</span> In this age of growing water scarcities it is past
time we learned to husband
and nurture rent, in order to socialize it by taxing the
surplus. So should you, in
comparable circumstances.
&nbsp;</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Another value from water is to
generate power.</span> Again,
California witlessly fails to
socialize this value, but Canada, our northern neighbor,
has shown the way.
British Columbia, Newfoundland (the Labrador part),
Quebec, and other provinces
raise large revenues from charges on the use of falling
water. Russia, with some of
the world's largest hydro-electric projects, can do the
same, or better.
</small><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries are another source of
value.</span> In the past most
nations have let this rent
be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
the number of licenses and
boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
It created large rents,
where previously there were little or none, by preventing
overfishing and the great
waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
fishing effort. That is a good
example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
necessary before you can
collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
give away this net benefit
to private parties.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell
these licenses, but simply
gave them away to owners
of existing boats, and others with political influence.
Each license now sells for
something like a million dollars, creating a new class of
instant millionaires and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
giveaway to the few, and takeaway
from the many,
created an instant class society where before there were
equal access and equal
opportunities. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
privileges are worth so much that there are now
documented cases off
Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
catch. </span>The captain, the
crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
the dangers and
discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
with the other 30%. Parlor
fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
socialized, relieving the
workers from taxes.
</small>...<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid "perverse subsidies." </span>These
are subsidies
that encourage
harmful things like </small><small></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>polluting air and water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>wasting
water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>cutting timber
whose value is less than the cost of logging, or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>populating remote regions
whose costs exceed the benefits derived.</small> </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Cape Breton Island, the northern tip of Nova Scotia,
contains the most
polluted area in Canada thanks to years of subsidies
to sustain its
uneconomic, obsolescent coal and steel industries
that employ just a few
people by fouling one of the most scenic jewels in
North America. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> We have mentioned how we actually subsidize people to
withdraw scarce
water from our overdrawn rivers in the arid U.S.A.
The so-called water
"shortage" in the lower Colorado River is entirely an
artifact of such
misguided policies: every major agency drawing on the
Colorado is actually
subsidized to do so, when they should be paying for
the privilege. If they
paid, they would stop wasting water, and would enrich
the Treasury, which
could then abate taxes on work, trade, and
saving.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> The U.S. Forest Service has turned a great national
asset, our national
forestlands, into a drain on the Treasury by
subsidizing forest roads in
subeconomic areas. It makes money selling good timber
in good areas,
but then spends $10 on roads into subeconomic areas
to get $1 in
revenues from sale of timber to private parties,
destroying scenic values
and watershed protection.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> Perverse subsidies like those are unspeakably foolish
and wasteful. They
"dissipate rent" so there is none left to tax.&nbsp;

<small>But here's a very important point, rarely noticed by

landholders are assessed for LVT, they are financially compelled to put
that land to its optimum use. For, whether landowners do put the land
to its optimum use or not, they are still saddled with the same LVT. So
landholders must use it productively or pass it on to those who will

Employment, Growth And Progress On A Small Planet: Relieving Poverty
While Healing The Earth</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> Renewal as
intensification.</b> George observed land speculation in California
when it was young and raw. Today, an equally or more baneful aspect
of underusing land is found in older blighted <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">slums</span>, where underuse
takes the form of non-renewal. Thus, land of high capacity is
providing only minimal service and employment. Why do we not get
timely renewal? The most obvious reason is that the sites under old
buildings bear low tax valuations, because assessors mistake the
building for the site and overlook its reuse value, or opportunity
cost. Let the owner renew the site, and taxes shoot up: not only on
the new building, but often on the site as well. Result: nonrenewal.
So capital that should go to renew these sites of high potential
migrates outward instead, to where tax rates are lower and subsidies
are higher, wasting capital in duplicating the infrastructure, and of
course also wasting land. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many
Georgists fail to see that a
major part of the problem is
underassessment of the land. Land is underassessed when tax-valuers
lapse into using the &#8220;building-first, land-residual&#8221; method
of separating land from building values. This results in land
valuations so absurdly low that one observes, in many cities and
neighborhoods, most of the joint value of land/building being
allocated to the building in the very year that the owner chooses to
demolish the building, i.e. when the building really no longer has
any value at all. </span>Then the assessor raises the land valuation
under
the new, or replacement building &#8211; making the land tax in effect
an additional tax on the new building. The correct method is the
&#8220;land-first, building-residual&#8221; method: value the land as
though vacant, and give the old building the excess, if any, of the
joint value over the land value. Then the land value remains fixed
when a new building arises, and the land tax serves, as it should, as
a stimulus to rebuilding (Gaffney, 2001). 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Weight of
excess burden of most taxes.</b> Many modern Georgists tend, oddly,
to trivialize the power of tax bias to keep land from its best use.
They have seized upon a conventional micro-economic device, now
generally called the &#8220;Harberger Triangle,&#8221; in recognition
of one Chicago-School expositor. It is based on supply and demand
curves, with no reference to land markets at all. Perhaps these
Georgists are hoping this will help them get through to ordinary
economists; but this device has the effect, by accident or design, of
minimizing estimates of the economic losses, or &#8220;excess
burdens,&#8221; that bad taxes cause. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The power of tax bias to keep land
from its best use is starkly
obvious by analyzing the economics of using marginal land. Any tax at
all will sterilize such land completely, unless the taxes are so
universal that the mobile factors, labor and capital, cannot escape
them by moving. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&#8220;Who cares about marginal land?&#8221;,
some may say. The
distorting power of taxes has been demonstrated inadvertently by
Chicago-School economists Gale Johnson and Stephen Cheung. They have
shown that <span style="font-weight: bold;">sharecropping</span>, as a
private arrangement, creates a bias on
the part of tenants to substitute land for labor and equipment,
almost without limit. This is because extra land costs the cropper
nothing, unless it adds to output, so the cropper&#8217;s interest is
to substitute land, which is free to him, for his labor and capital,
which he pays for. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxes
based on gross output affect
all landowners the same way the
cropshare lease affects croppers.</span> They make every landowner a
cropper
of the state, giving every landowner a motive to substitute land for
labor and capital indefinitely. Private landlords overcome this by
limiting how much land to allow each cropper; but the state has no
such offsetting control. Thus, each landowner&#8217;s motive to
acquire excess land runs wild. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In conjunction, consider that
taxes (other than property taxes)
are based solely on cash flows, thus entirely exempting all the
imputed income from and imputed consumption of the service flows of
land &#8211; the &#8220;amenities.&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Government
tells the landed
gentry, &#8220;Hold land as a totem, an heirloom, a private hunting
and riding park, a dream of future retirement, a speculation, a hedge
against inflation, an entry into high society, a beach access, a
protection against future neighbors, a shooting range, a golf course,
a ski hideaway, a drinking club, a private landing strip &#8230;
anything private and narcissistic or exclusionary or snobbish &#8230;
and your pleasures are tax exempt. Produce goods and services for
others, though, and we will treat you like a sharecropper &#8211; and
tax your employees, too.&#8221;</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now hark back to George&#8217;s second
force holding labor off the
better lands (Item A,3,b): <span style="font-weight: bold;">holding
land as a totem</span>. He noted that

taxes. Our present tax system magnifies the tendency beyond all
reason, resulting in the relegation of much of our best land to the
indulgences of the landed gentry, old and new....<a href="../docs/Gaffney_FEFPOASP-RPWHTE.html"> <span

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Taxing built-value penalizes construction and
maintenance of buildings. This deadweight loss on the local economy
constrains housing supply and raises land values, driving speculation.
Fewer people can then own parcels for homes and businesses, and debt
levels increase. ... </small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The tax on land values is
the most just and equal of all
taxes. It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and
valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they
receive. It is the taking by the community, for the use of the
community, of that value which is the creation of the community. It is
the application of the common property to common uses (George, P&amp;P,
421).</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And yet, my friends, in the
topsy-turvy world in which we live,
this provided fund goes mainly into the pockets of speculators and
monopolists, while the body politic meets its needs by extorting from
individual producers the fruits of honest toil. If ever there were
any doubt about the perversity of human nature, our present system of
taxation is the proof! Everywhere about us, we see the ironic
spectacle of the community penalizing the individual for his industry
and initiative, and taking away from him a share of that which he
produces, yet at the same time lavishing upon the non-producer
undeserved windfalls which it &#8212; the community &#8212; produces.
And, as<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/auth/Churchill.html"> Winston Churchill </a>put it,
the unearned increment, the
socially-produced value of the land, is reaped by the speculator in
exact proportion, not to the service, but to the disservice, done.
"The greater the injury to society, the greater the reward."</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We hear constantly a vast clamor

  <li><small>Or is it the man &#8212; perhaps a civic leader and a pillar

Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/justice_the_object_taxation_the_means.html">Justice
the Object -- Taxation the Means</a> (1890)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... if we want more wealth &#8212; if
we call that country prosperous which is increasing in wealth &#8212; is it
not a piece of stupidity that we should tax men for producing wealth?
Yet that is what we are doing today. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small> Here we say we want more manufacturers. The American people
submit to enormous taxes for the purpose of building up factories;
yet when a man builds a factory, what do we do? Why, we come down and
tax him for it. </small><br>
<br>
<small>We certainly want more houses. There are a few people who have
bigger houses than any one reasonable family can occupy; but the
great mass of the American people are underhoused. There, in the city
of New York, the plight to which all American cities are tending, you
will find that 65 % of the population are living two families or more
to the single floor. Yet let a man put a house in any part of the
United States, and down comes the tax-gatherer to demand a fine for
having put up a house. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We say that industry is a good
thing, and that thrift is a good
thing; and there are some people who say that if a man be
industrious, and if a man he thrifty, he can easily accumulate
wealth. Whether that be true or not, industry is certainly a good
thing, and thrift is certainly a good thing. But what do we do if a
man be industrious? If he produces wealth enough, and by thrift
accumulates wealth at all, down comes the tax-gatherer to demand a
part of it. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We say that that is stupid; that
we ought not by our taxes to
repress the production of wealth; that when a farmer reclaims a strip
of the desert and turns it into an orchard and a vineyard, or on the
prairie produces crops and feeds fine cattle, that, so far from being
taxed and fined for having done these things, we ought to be glad
that he has done it; that we ought to welcome all energy; that no man
can Produce wealth for himself without augmenting the general stock,
without making the whole country richer. We impose some taxes for the
purpose of getting rid of things, for the purpose of having fewer of
the things that we tax. In most of our counties and States when dogs
become too numerous, there is imposed a dog tax to get rid of dogs.
Well, we impose a dog tax to get rid of dogs, and why should we
impose a house tax unless we want to get rid of houses? Why should we
impose a farm tax unless we want fewer farms? Why should we tax any
man for having exerted industry or energy in the production of
wealth? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Tax houses and there will
certainly be fewer houses. If you go
east to the city of Brooklyn, you may see that demonstrated to the
eye. What first surprised me in the city of churches was to see long
rows of buildings, of brown-stone houses, two stories in front and
three stories behind; or three stories in front and four stories
behind; and I thought for a moment what foolish idea ever entered the
brains of those men, to have left out half an upper story in that
way? I found out by inquiring that it was all on account of tax. In
the city of Brooklyn, the assessor is only supposed to look in front,
and so by making the house in that way, you can get a three-story
building behind with only a two-story front and a two-story tax. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So in England, in the old houses,
there you may see the result of
the window tax. The window tax is in force in France today, and in
France there are two hundred thousand houses, according to the
census, that have no window at all &#8212; in order to escape the tax.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So if you tax ships there will be
fewer ships. What old San
Franciscan cannot remember the day when in this harbour might be seen
the graceful forms and lofty spars of so many American ships, the
fleetest and best in the world? I well remember the day that no
American who crossed to Europe thought of crossing on any other than
an American ship. Today, if you wish to cross the Atlantic, you must
cross on a British steamer, unless you choose to cross on a German or
French steamer. On the high seas of the world the American ship is
becoming almost as rare as a Chinese junk. Why? Simply because we
have taxed our ships out of existence. There is the proof. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Tax buildings, and you
will
have fewer or poorer buildings; tax
farms, and you will have fewer farms and more wilderness; tax ships,
there will be fewer and poorer ships; and tax capital, and there will
he less capital; but you may tax land values all you please and there
will not he a square inch the less land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Tax land values all you
please up to the point of taking the full annual value &#8212; up to the
point of making mere ownership in land utterly unprofitable, so that
no one will want merely to own land &#8212; what will be the result?
Simply that land will be the easier had by the user. Simply that the
land will become valueless to the mere speculator &#8212; to the dog in
the manger, who wants merely to hold and not to use; to the
forestaller, who wants merely to reap where others have sown, to
gather to himself the products of labour, without doing labour. Tax
land values, and you leave to production its full rewards, and you
open to producers natural opportunities.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>The case for site value rating in terms of economic efficiency is founded
        on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by human effort
        is one of the few sources of government revenue that does not reduce
        incentives for people to be productive. Two other revenue sources that
        have this virtue are taxes on other government-granted privileges such
        as exclusive use of radio frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful
        consequences, such as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient
        if revenue sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to
        the greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
        productivity.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">What makes a tax efficient is that the amount of tax that
      is due cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes
      are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
      They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses are
      taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building fewer house
      and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage worsens. But when
      the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no resulting diminution
      in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be levied on land without diminishing
      the productivity of an economy. And shifting taxes from other, destructive
      bases to land will improve the productivity of an economy. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">read

    Just Don't Know How to Tax Their Wealth!</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
  <p>It's been an axiom of urban policy for the past half century to lament the
      plight of American cities &#8212; that they have lost their most productive
      populations, that their infrastructure is deteriorated and obsolete, that they
      contain people most in need, and that their tax base is limited. This essay
      argues that none of this needs to be so, and that municipal leaders need only
      to think &quot;outside the box&quot; as the hackneyed phrase goes, to find
      undreamed of revenue that will not only provide all the support cities
      need but enhance the economic vitality of their being by its collection.</p>
  <p>As conventionally viewed, cities not only have need for more services but
      lack the tax base on which to draw from. The services are greater in cities
      than in suburban and rural communities because that's where streets and other
      general services are the heaviest, where the schools are the greatest challenge,
      where the police and fire departments are most relied upon, where the social
      programs face the greatest pathologies, and where general administration is
      the most complex and requires the greatest control and coordination. It seems
      so obvious that it hardly needs mentioning, and no further discussion is required.</p>
  <p>At the same time, so the argument goes, the revenue bases upon which to
    levy taxes are most lacking: the middle class and the wealthier populations
    have
      largely moved out, and stores have relocated to malls and highway junctions
      taking the sales tax base with them. What's left are deteriorating buildings
      and a complaining citizenry: the footloose commercial and industrial sector
      also threatens to relocate along with a residential population feeling
    strangled by growing municipal and school taxes on real property. A few cities
    have reached
      beyond taxation of property and sales to impose one more &#8212; an income
      tax &#8212; on top of the others. And greater reliance upon user fees and
      on privatized services shifts the burden increasingly to the poor.</p>
  <p>It is difficult to argue with the truth of this picture. The most recent National
      League of Cities Annual Report<font size="-1"><strong><em>[1] </em></strong></font>indicated
      that most urban officials are very pessimistic about the general directions
      the country is heading, and most expect continued decreases in the levels
      services in years to come. Using almost any indicator &#8212; traffic, unemployment,
      infrastructure, housing, drug and alcohol abuse, or economic conditions, the
      problems have gotten worse. As federal and state taxes are cut back in the
      face of growing resentment, local leaders are faced with a Hobson's choice &#8212; raise
      more taxes or further cut services. In recent years, the changes in revenue
      streams between federal, state, and local governments show a continued
      decrease of support in all areas.</p>

            2004: The Annual Opinion Survey of Muncipal Elected Officials. www.nlc.org/resources_for_cities/publications/1637.cfm.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The revenue choices, political leaders assume, are between taxes on real property,
      retail sales, and personal income. All three are recognized to have strong
      negative impacts. Property taxes, well documented as being the most resented
      of all,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[2]</em></strong></font> are viewed
      as unevenly and even arbitrarily applied, regressive, and destructive of
      economic vitality.
      Sales taxes are acknowledged also as regressive and easily evaded. And
      income taxes, intended as a means of taxing the &quot;rich,&quot; also
      have downside consequences in their invitation to both tax avoidance and
      enactment of loopholes
      by compliant legislatures. What then to do? The more each tax rate is increased,
      the greater the tendency to institute beggar-thy-neighbor policies that
      raise the cost of their administration and foster more resentment and evasion.
      Not
      without reason do tax experts regard politics today as essentially a contest
      over taxes.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3] .</em></strong></font>.. <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read

  <p>    One might expect such arguments to have led to the advocacy of land nationalisation.
      But George thought this unnecessary because a tax on land could be effective
      in capturing the economic surplus arising from land ownership. This tax
      would generate all the revenue necessary to fund public expenditures. George
      thought that such a land tax would permit the removal of other taxes on
      labour and capital, which he regarded as inherently inefficient. He argued
      that taxes on incomes, sales, and payrolls, for example, acted as disincentives
      to production and active endeavour, thereby stifling economic growth and
      creating a barrier to full employment. A land tax, by contrast, would be
      both economically efficient and more equitable in its distributional effects.
      ...</p>
  <p>Indeed, one could say that the term &#8216;tax&#8217; is a misnomer because
    what is really involved is value created by the community being retained
    by the community rather than being appropriated by private landholders. For
    example, under current arrangements landowners receive &#8216;windfall&#8217; gains
    when the market value of their land rises as a result of publicly provided
    infrastructure being built nearby, or when local government zoning decisions
    reclassify their land as appropriate for further development. In this way,
    individual landowners stand to reap huge benefits at the expense of community-generated
    processes. Such arrangements create an odd incentive: allowing landholders
    to appropriate the unearned wealth generated by rising land values, thereby
    rewarding this unproductive activity, while taxing productive endeavour.
    The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217;, by contrast, would eliminate
    such perverse incentives and thereby more effectively align private and public
    interests in the use of society&#8217;s resources. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Henry George&#8217;s Solution: Taxing the Flow of Land Rent</p>
  <p>If land values are really the present values of anticipated future ground
    rents, one can certainly treat them as flows rather than stocks, just as
    community services are continuous flows. The amount of rent flowing through
    a site and through the economy is not negligible; what estimates have been
    made, where indeed the economic data allow it to be made, suggest that it
    is roughly a third of a nation&#8217;s GDP.29 The question is whether it
    makes more sense to. Should we elect to continue property tax regimes as
    we do, it would make better sense to tax buildings as stocks and lands as
    rent flows. But this raises the question whether real property should be
    exempt from all taxes, as some have argued.30 What rationale exists for taxing
    lands, whether as stocks or flows; and why do we tax buildings? I will argue
    below that taxing buildings and the failure to adequately tax land both have
    deleterious consequences for the whole economy.</p>
  <p>Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of any
    sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained largely
    as a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century or two have
    buildings represented any significant capital value; prior to the rise of
    major cities, the value of real property lay essentially in land. American
    cities today typically record aggregate assessed land values &#8211; at least
    when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of total taxable
    value, that is, of land and buildings taken together.31 <strong>Skyscrapers
    reflect enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted because
    of
    the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets its market price from
    the fact that the total neighborhood context creates an attractive market
    presence and ambience. By taxing buildings, however, we impose a penalty
    on their optimum development as well as on the incentives for their maintenance.
    Moreover, taxes on buildings take away from whatever burden would otherwise
    be imposed on sites, with the result that incentives for their highest and
    best use is weakened. </strong>Lastly, the technical and administrative challenges
    of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting, particularly
    since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes, evaluated
    for potential replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated with
    administration of property taxation and appeal litigation involve disputes
    over the valuation of structures, not land values. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>

Transportation, Economic Rent, and Land Use<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>...
  The failure to collect site rent leads to a distortion in land use
  configurations. If patterns unfolded along the lines of both social
  preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites would tend to
  have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend to be
  vacant or have very modest buildings. Consistent with this, urban
  centers sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded
  by lower-value residential land uses, and still further out would be
  farms and forests. The ratio of building to land value, land to total
  value (or for that matter any other ratio between buildings, land, and
  total values) would be relatively constant throughout a region.
  Instead, the ratio of land value to total value consistently tends to
  reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient settlement
  of land sites is what we know as sprawl.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Rent is Capitalized
  Transportation Cost</span></small><br>
  <small>There is another dimension to the distortion of land use in
  contemporary life. That is the heavy subsidy granted to motor vehicle
  transportation services. Estimates are that the typical driver pays
  only about a tenth of the true cost of his travel; society picks up the
  rest.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> This profuse subsidy paid to
  private automobile and truck
  transportation further encourages people to locate on sites at far
  greater distances from where they would choose than if they had to pay
  the full burden of that travel. </span>... <a

  <p>Thomas Flavin, writing in <a href="http://www.knowledgerush.com/pg/etext96/bti1010.txt">The
      Iconoclast, 1897</a> </p>
  </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, it is quite true that all taxes of whatever nature are paid out of
        the products of labor. But must they be for that reason a tax on labor
        products. Let us see. </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>I suppose you won't deny that a unit of labor applies to different kinds
          of land will give very different results. Suppose that a unit of labor
          produces on A's land 4, on B's 3, on C's 2 and on D's 1. A's land is the
          most, and D's is the least, productive land in use in the community to
          which they belong. B's and C's represent intermediate grades. Suppose each
          occupies the best land that was open to him when he entered into possession.
          Now, B, and C, and D have just as good a right to the use of the best land
          as A had. </p>
  </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Manifestly then, if this be the whole story, there cannot be equality
          of opportunity where a unit of labor produces such different results, all
          other things being equal except the land. </p>
  </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">How is this equality to be secured? There is but one possible way. Each
        must surrender for the common use of all, himself included, whatever advantages
        accrues to him from the possession of land superior to that which falls
        to the lot of him who occupies the poorest. </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>In the case stated, what the unit of labor produces
    for D, is what it should produce for A, B and C, if these are not to have an
    advantage of
          natural opportunity over D. </p>
  </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence equity is secured when A pays 3, D, 2 and C, 1 into a common fund
        for the common use of all--to be expended, say in digging a well, making
        a road or bridge, building a school, or other public utility. </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Is it not manifest that here the tax which A, B and C pay into a common
          fund, and from which D is exempt, is not a tax on their labor products
          (though paid out of them) but a tax on the superior advantage which they
          enjoy over D, and to which D has just as good a right as any of them. </p>
  </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>The result of this arrangement is that each takes up as much of the best
          land open to him as he can put to gainful use, and what he cannot so use
          he leaves open for the next. Moreover, he is at no disadvantage with the
          rest who have come in ahead of him, for they provide for him, in proportion
          to their respective advantages, those public utilities which invariably
          arise wherever men live in communities. Of course he will in turn hold
          to those who come later the same relation that those who came earlier held
          to him. </p>
  <p><strong>Suppose now that taxes had been levied on labor products instead
      of land; all that any land-holder would have to do to avoid the tax is
      to produce
        little or nothing. He could just squat on his land, neither using it
      himself nor letting others use it, but he would not stop at this, for he
      would
        grab to the last acre all that he could possibly get hold of. </strong>Each of the
        others would do the same in turn, with the sure result that by and by,
        E, F and G would find no land left for them on which they might make a
        living. </p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>So they would have to hire their labor to those who had already monopolized
          the land, or else buy or rent a piece of land from them. Behold now the
          devil of landlordism getting his hoof on God's handiwork! Exit justice,
          freedom, social peace and plenty. Enter robbery, slavery, social discontent,
          consuming grief, riotous but unearned wealth, degrading pauperism, crime
        breeding, want, the beggar's whine, and the tyrant's iron heel. </p>
  </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>And how did it all come about? By the simple expedient of taxing labor
          products in order that precious landlordism might laugh and grow fat on
          the bovine stupidity of the community that contributes its own land values
          toward its own enslavement!</p>
  </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>And yet men vacuously ask, &quot;What difference
    does it make?&quot; </p>
  <p>O tempora! O mores! To be as plain as is necessary, it makes this four-fold
        difference. </p>
  </div>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
    First, it robs the community of its land values; 
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
    second, it robs labor of its wages in the name of taxation; 
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        third, it sustains and fosters landlordism,
                          a most conspicuously 
                 damnable
          difference;<l
       ></li>
    <li>fourth, it exhibits willing workers in enforced idleness; beholding
                                                            their families in want on the one hand, and unused land that would yield
                      them abundance on the other. 
        </div>
            </div>
            </div>
            </div>
          </li>
                    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>This last is a difference that cries to heaven
    for vengeance, and if it does not always cry in vain, will W. C. Brann be
    able to draw his robe
          close around him and with a good conscience exclaim, &quot;It's none
          of my fault; I am not my brother's keeper.&quot;</p>
