  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>Two-rate taxation, talso known as split-rate taxation, is one of the
        finest tools if you are looking to change the world by thinking globally
        and acting locally. Two-rate taxation allows a municipality to divorce
        from each other two taxes that traditionally have been tied to each other.
        (See <a href="Property_tax_is_two_taxes.htm">the property tax is two
        taxes</a>.) Two-rate permits a town or city to reduce the millage rate
        on buildings and increase the millage rate on land. Or, in a situation
        when local government finds itself in need of additional revenue, they
        can raise that money by increasing the millage rate on land without also
        increasing the millage rate on buildings, so that the incremental costs
        are borne by landholders in proportion to the value of their land holdings
        without regard to whether they have improved that land to its highest
        and best use or are underusing it. </p>
      <p><em>A caution</em>: in Massachusetts, these terms are sometimes used
        differently, to denote different millage rates for residential and commercial
        property.
        Georgists see this approach as at best  pointless and at worst providing
        very perverse incentives. However, those who are interested in Massachusetts'
        idea might want to
        look at
        our ideas
        more
        closely,
        because what our remedy does may better serve the goals they embrace,
        in large part because the land under commercial properties tends to be
        far more valuable than the sites on which homes are located (with the
        exception of waterfront).</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here we find many activist
Georgists suffering from another blind
spot. A major modern Georgist thrust is to push for a local municipal
shift from the ordinary property tax to a &#8220;Two-rate&#8221;
system, with a higher rate on land than on buildings. In doing so,
they make a campaign issue and a litmus test of how the tax burden on
&#8220;homeowners&#8221; will fall. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Carried to an
oversimplified
extreme, this ignores all differences among &#8220;homeowners,&#8221;
melding the landed gentry on huge lots or vast acreages with the poor
in modest hovels on tiny crowded lots, or parts of lots. It ignores
the tax rate on rental apartment units, which almost everywhere is,
de facto, higher than on owned units. </span>We must be prepared for
cases
where taxing those vast acreages will make the taxes of homeowners
rise &#8211; and explain why that is a good thing.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The &#8220;homeowner&#8221; orientation of
many modern Georgist
campaigners plays into the hands of those who favor income taxation
and sales taxation over property taxation.&nbsp; If the goal is indeed
to
favor &#8220;homeowners&#8221; per se, then we should abandon the
property tax altogether in favor of income and sales taxes, in their
present biased forms. The imputed income of owner-occupied lands,
including lands held for sport and recreation, is entirely exempt
from income taxes, whose base exempts non-cash income. The imputed
consumption of these lands is also exempt from sales taxes. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternatively,
if we accept the income and sales taxes as
&#8220;givens,&#8221; we must allow that they are both outrageously
favorable to owner-occupants</span>, so there is no overall merit in
jiggering the local property tax the same way. On the contrary,
owner-occupied housing is an unpreempted tax base that localities
should seize, to redress the balance. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By focusing on gains to
&#8220;homeowners,&#8221; Georgist
campaigners are misstating the revolutionary implications of their
own reform, and confusing their audiences. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">George spoke for the
landless, the tenants, the young, the upwardly mobile, orphans with
nothing to inherit (as opposed to the mythical orphans who own all
the property in the country), the students and trainees, the
exploited workers, the innovators and entrepreneurs and adventurers
who turn their capital and turn the wheels of capitalism &#8211; not
so much for stolid settled burghers and retirees who own land.</span>
Their
buildings, yes, he would exempt. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But if those buildings rest on
land
of high social utility, they are playing the role of land
speculators.</span> Call them Type #3 speculators: the
&#8220;passive-aggressive&#8221; type. (For Types #1 and #2, see item
9, below.) <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Walt Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html">Have We
Forgotten The Foundation?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Americans owe a tremendous debt
to architects and others who led the
movement to save and restore our nation's historic buildings and
neighborhoods.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">My thesis today is that it is
equally
imperative to restore our historic land policy that provided a
foundation for the flowering of wholesome cities and towns. Otherwise,
precious treasures saved by preservationists are in danger of becoming
isolated islands in an unsavory sea of urban ugliness, misery and
blight.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Land policy is rarely addressed in books by or about architects.
For
most of the past century, political, scientists, sociologists, planners
and economists also typically failed to focus on land policy.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The good news is that we can
reclaim our historic foundation.<br>
<br>
A problem is that our present property tax imposes a single tax rate on
the total land-plus-building value. When a locality increases the good
land tax, it automatically raises the destructive building tax. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus
the obvious first reform is to sever the unholy union of these
distinctly different parts of the property tax.</span><br>
<br>
Pittsburgh pioneered an easy way to do this with a <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">two-rate tax.</span>
It
taxed buildings at only one-sixth the rate on site values. Aliquippa
taxes land at a rate 16 times higher than on buildings. Some 20
Pennsylvania cities and towns utilize this approach, gradually
reducing taxes on structures. Results have been uniformly
good -- bringing idle land and empty buildings back into use,
rejuvenating business districts, and holding home prices in check so
seniors on fixed incomes are not pushed out of their neighborhoods.<br>
<br>
Architects and other preservationists can help revive urban livability
by...
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Joining forces with those who are pushing for this
two-rate tax reform;</small></li>
  <li><small>Persuading local governments to pass resolutions urging
their
state legislatures to enable them to tax land and buildings at separate
rates;</small></li>
  <li><small>Pushing state legislators to follow through on this
action; and</small></li>
  <li><small>Finally, at every opportunity, bringing public attention
to the
necessity of recapturing publicly created land values as a way to save
our cities. Those who make restoration of America's historic land
system a part of the historic resources agenda will be doing a great
service to the country. This is the challenge and the
opportunity.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html"><span
