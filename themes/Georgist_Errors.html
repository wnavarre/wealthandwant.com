<p>If you spend much time around Georgists,
  you'll
  probably hear Henry George's name mentioned in a respectful and affectionate
  tone. It isn't that we agree with everything he ever said (though I've heard
  there are several who do). Rather, it is that, taken together, his
  ideas best express and inform our understanding of what it would take to create
  economic
  and social
justice in our own time and place.</span></p>
<p>And most Georgists would say that, were you to compile a short list of American
  prophets, Henry George's name should be on that list. We commend his ideas
  
to your attention.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Historical
Precedents</b></small><br>
<small>We are not the first people to assert that governments should
not
allow anyone to appropriate an excessive share of nature's bounty.
Hints of our ideas can be found in the writings of 17th century
English philosopher, John Locke.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/themes/Physiocrats.html">physiocrats</a>
of 18th century France: Quesnay, Turgot, Condorcet
and others who sought to reform that country's tax system prior to
its bloody revolution understood the importance of collecting a
nation's revenue from levies upon land. The 19th century English
philosophers Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill understood the
injustice of claims to the ownership of land, though they could not
bring themselves to recommend the fiscal measures that flow naturally
from that insight.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the person whose writings gave
greatest impetus to our ideas
was the 19th century American social philosopher, <a
 href="About_HG.html">Henry George</a>. His
books and <a href="../HG/Speeches.html">speeches</a> contain
powerful elucidations of ideas that we
espouse. We particularly recommend <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress
and Poverty</i></b></a>
and <b><i>Protection or Free Trade</i></b>. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">It should be understood
that while we admire George's work, we do not regard him as an
infallible authority. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Our commitment
is to principles of justice that
we believe are part of the understanding of all open-minded people.
George is the person who, in our view, has provided the best written
expression of these principles so far.</span></span></small></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>Some Georgist
Errors to Discard </b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>1, Capital and labor.
</b>George went overboard identifying capital with labor, because
labor produces capital. He saw labor, rather than saving and
investing, as the source of capital.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>2, Capital formation.</b>
George as a theorist was insouciant about the need for market
incentives to create capital. In this respect he slightly and
superficially resembled Marx and Keynes, but only in theory. In
practise, he saw the role of taxation in weakening such incentives,
and so he advocated untaxing capital. His policy proposals do
recognize the need for incentives for capital. It is his rationale
that is rather twisted &#8211; he thought that by untaxing capital he
was untaxing labor. This left a blind spot among some of his modern
like-thinkers, who are not alert to the bias and distortions involved
in untaxing capital while taxing labor (Gaffney, 1995).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>3, Income-creating
spending</b>. George needlessly belittled the role of income-creating
investing in creating jobs. Again, his policy proposal, to untax
capital, would foster such job creation, but he went out of his way
to deny the relationship, which he regarded as patronizing to labor
as such.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>4, Role of interest
rates.</b> George had little concept of the role of interest rates
and rates of return in allocating or rationing capital. He had almost
no concept at all of the role of interest rates in conserving working
capital from being sequestered and wasted in
&#8220;pyramid-building&#8221; kinds of projects (whether
developmental, premature, or just megalomaniac). He dismissed his
contemporary Austrian economists for what he took as merely
scientistic obscurity, pomp and pretense, while he missed the valid
analysis underlying them (Gaffney, 1976). In a word, they taught that
the function of interest rates is to direct capital away from
&#8220;hard path&#8221; technology, reserving it for the
&#8220;soft-path.&#8221; Those were not their exact terms or concepts.
The way they saw it, higher interest rates discourage what we now
call &#8220;upstream&#8221; production (mining, primary products) in
favor of more downstream production (processing, storing, packaging,
distributing, recycling, etc.), nearer the ultimate consumer.
(&#8220;Near&#8221; may mean in space or in time, or some combination.)
They called them &#8220;higher&#8221; and &#8220;lower&#8221; stages of
production, but a rose by any other name &#8230; . </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, high interest rates are
friendly to the environment, and
today&#8217;s panacea, lower rates, lead us from soft to hard
technology. (Curiously, George&#8217;s first book, Our Land and Land
Policy, (1871) contains a cogent criticism of the waste of capital in
premature railroad building &#8211; this is missing from later works.) <a
