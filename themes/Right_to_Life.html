<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>In the US in the first decade of the
  twenty first century, the phrase "right to life" has a very specific
  popular meaning which relates to issues of abortion.&nbsp; But let's put aside
  for the moment the question of when a blastocyte or embryo becomes a
  human being, and see what else the phrase "right to life" might mean
  here and now, for the already born.</p>
  <p>What does it mean to have a right to life? What does it mean to have a birthright?
    What does it mean to be created equal? Do our systems and structures live
    up to
    our
    creeds?
    How
    could
    we
    improve them, without throwing everything into turmoil?</p>

Henry George:&nbsp; <a
 href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
 Land Question</a> (1881) <a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html"><br>
</a>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, what are the rights of this case? </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To whom rightfully does the soil of Ireland belong? </li>
    <li>Who are justly entitled to its use and to all the benefits that
      flow from its use? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let us settle this question clearly and decisively, before we
    attempt anything else.</p>
  <p>Let me go to the heart of this question by asking another
    question: Has or has not the child born in Ireland a right to live?
    There can be but one answer, for no one would contend that it was
    right to drown Irish babies, or that any human law could make it
    right. Well, then, if every human being born in Ireland has a right
    to live in Ireland, these rights must be equal. If each one has a
    right to live, then no one can have any better right to live than any
    other one. There can be no dispute about this. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">No one will contend
    that it would be any less a crime to drown a baby of an Irish peasant
    woman than it would be to drown the baby of the proudest duchess</span>,
    or
    that a law commanding the one would be any more justifiable than a
    law commanding the other.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Since, then, all the Irish people
    have the same equal right to
    life, it follows that they must all have the same equal right to the
    land of Ireland.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If
    they are all in Ireland by the same equal
    permission of Nature, so that no one of them can justly set up a
    superior claim to life than any other one of them; so that all the
    rest of them could not justly say to any one of them, "You have not
    the same right to live as we have; therefore we will pitch you out of
    Ireland into the sea!" then they must all have the same equal rights
    to the elements which Nature has provided for the sustaining of
    life &#8211; to air, to water, and to land.</span> For to deny the equal
    right
    to the elements necessary to the maintaining of life is to deny the
    equal right to life. Any law that said, "Certain babies have no right
    to the soil of Ireland; therefore they shall be thrown off the soil
    of Ireland;" would be precisely equivalent to a law that said,
"Certain babies have no right to live; therefore they shall be thrown
    into the sea." And as no law or custom or agreement can justify the
    denial of the equal right to life, so no law or custom or agreement
    can justify the denial of the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>It therefore follows, from the very fact of their existence, that
    the right of each one of the people of Ireland to an equal share in
    the land of Ireland is equal and inalienable: that is to say, that
    the use and benefit of the land of Ireland belong rightfully to the
    whole people of Ireland, to each one as much as to every other; to no
    one more than to any other&#8211;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>not to some individuals, to the
      exclusion of other individuals; </li>
    <li>not to one class, to the exclusion of
      other classes; </li>
    <li>not to landlords, </li>
    <li>not to tenants, </li>
    <li>not to cultivators, </li>
    <li>but to the whole people.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This right is irrefutable and indefeasible. It pertains to and
    springs from the fact of existence, the right to live. No law, no
    covenant, no agreement, can bar it. One generation cannot stipulate
    away the rights of another generation. If the whole people of Ireland
    were to unite in bargaining away their rights in the land, how could
    they justly bargain away the right of the child who the next moment
    is born? No one can bargain away what is not his; no one can
    stipulate away the rights of another. And if the new-born infant has
    an equal right to life, then has it an equal right to land. Its
    warrant, which comes direct from Nature, and which sets aside all
    human laws or title-deeds, is the fact that it is born.</p>
  <p>Here we have a firm, self-apparent principle from which we may
    safely proceed. The land of Ireland does not belong to one individual
    more than to another individual; to one class more than to another
    class; to one generation more than to the generations that come
    after. It belongs to the whole people who at the time exist upon
    it. ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

    Dangers</a> (Chapter 2 of <strong><em><a href="../../HG/SP/000_TOC.htm">Social Problems</a></em></strong>,
1883)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the aggregation
  of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations, necessarily implies the loss
  by the people of governmental control. Democratic forms may be maintained,
  but there can be as much tyranny and misgovernment under democratic forms as
  any other &#8212; in fact, they lend themselves most readily to tyranny and
  misgovernment. Forms count for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and
  continued to abhor
  the very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators, that
  at first meant no more than our &quot;Boss,&quot; they crouched before tyrants
  more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of &quot;bosses,&quot; developed
  political C&aelig;sars in municipalities and states. If this development continues,
  in time there will come a national boss. We are young but we are growing. The
  day may arrive when the &quot;Boss of America&quot; will be to the modern world
  what C&aelig;sar was to the Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic
  government in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
  something like equality &#8212; where the great mass of citizens are personally
  free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor made subject by
  their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in a property qualification.
  The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man. To give
  the suffrage to slaves is only to give votes to their owners. That universal
  suffrage may add to, instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we
  see when mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
  without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to
  vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.<strong> How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a square inch
  of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and, urged by starvation, must
  bid against his fellows for the privilege of using them? </strong>When it comes to voting
  tramps, some principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
  I have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse
  to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government. <a href="../../HG/SP/03_SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">... read the entire essay</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement
    divide the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive
    right to his share as against the other. But neither could rightfully continue
    such claim against the next man born. For since no one comes into the world
    without God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his equal right to the
    use of God&#8217;s bounty. For them to refuse him any use of the earth which
    they had divided between them would therefore be for them to commit murder.
    And for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them
    or by giving them part of the products of his labor he bought it of them,
    would be for them to commit theft. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>And in taking for the uses of society what we clearly see is the great fund
    intended for society in the divine order, we would not levy the slightest
    tax on the possessors of wealth, no matter how rich they might be. Not only
    do we deem such taxes a violation of the right of property, but we see that
    by virtue of beautiful adaptations in the economic laws of the Creator, it
    is impossible for any one honestly to acquire wealth, without at the same
    time adding to the wealth of the world.</p>
  <p>To persist in a wrong, to refuse to undo it, is always to become involved
    in other wrongs. Those who defend private property in land, and thereby deny
    the first and most important of all human rights, the equal right to the
    material substratum of life, are compelled to one of two courses. Either
    they must, as do those whose gospel is &#8220;Devil take the hindermost,&#8221; deny
    the equal right to life, and by some theory like that to which the English
    clergyman Malthus has given his name, assert that nature (they do not venture
    to say God) brings into the world more men than there is provision for; or,
    they must, as do the socialists, assert as rights what in themselves are
    wrongs. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No man should be allowed to own any land that he does not use. Everybody
    knows that &#8212; I do not care whether he has thousands or millions. I
    have owned a great deal of land, but I know just as well as I know I am living
    that I should not be allowed to have it unless I use it. And why? Don't
    you know that if people could bottle the air, they would? Don't you know
    that there would be an American Air-bottling Association? And don't you know
    that they would allow thousands and millions to die for want of breath, if
    they could not pay for air? I am not blaming anybody. I am just telling how
    it is. <strong>Now, the land belongs to the children of Nature. Nature invites
    into this world every babe that is born. And what would you think of
    me, for instance, tonight, if I had invited you here &#8212; nobody had charged
    you anything, but you had been invited &#8212; and when you got here you
    had found one man pretending to occupy a hundred seats, another fifty, and
    another seventy-five, and thereupon you were compelled to stand up &#8212; what
    would you think of the invitation? It seems to me that every child
    of Nature is entitled to his share of the land, and that he should not be
    compelled
    to beg the privilege to work the soil, of a babe that happened to be born
    before him.</strong> And why do I say this? Because it is not to our interest to have
    a few landlords and millions of tenants. ... <a href="../docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html">read
