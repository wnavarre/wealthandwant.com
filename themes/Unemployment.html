<blockquote>
  <p align="left">When social conservatives talk about poverty, one of the things
    they most commonly say is that the problem with poor people is that they
    don't work 50 weeks per year! Those who work year-round, they say, are seldom
    poor!</p>
  <p align="left">There is some truth to that last statement, assuming one accepts
    the Federal Poverty Guideline as having some relation to reality &#8212; an
    assumption that few who have examined the matter recently or closely would
    agree to, particularly if they are familiar with any of our large cities.</p>
  <p align="left">But under our current way of doing things, there isn't always
    enough work for everyone, and the work may not be steady, and it may not
    pay enough (or even half of enough) to support a family and allow the
    worker to live within a reasonable distance of that work.</p>
  <p align="left">Are we stuck with that? Is it a natural or necessary state
    of affairs, or is there something wrong with this picture, something we can
    remedy? <strong><em>Wealthandwant</em></strong>    believes
    that this situation is wrong, and unnecessary, and can be remedied by a rather
    simple reform, first proposed 125 years ago by Henry George.  </p>

<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
    production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered. ...</p>
  <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid before
      labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage his
      labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
    <li> the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much for
          a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
    <li> the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have to expend
          a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
    <li> And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in lieu
          of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and stock.
        <p><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional economists,
                  have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension of this point.
                  Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced that the greater
                  cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor man who is trying to
                  save enough from his earnings to buy a piece of land; for, it is said,
                  the higher taxes on the land after it is acquired, offset the lower
                  purchase price. What such objectors do not see is that even if the
                  lower price of land does no more than balance the higher tax on it,
                  (and this overlooks, for one thing, the discouragement to speculation
                  in land), the reduction or removal of other taxes is all clear gain.
                  It is easier to save in proportion as earnings and commodities are
                  relieved of taxation. It is easier to buy land, because its selling
                  price is lower, if the land is taxed. And although the land, after
                  its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can this tax be fully
                  paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the purchase price,
                  but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on buildings and
                  other improvements and in whatever other taxes are thus rendered unnecessary.
                  H.G.B.</font></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
    would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with
    each other
      for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to the point
    of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for laborers,
    and
      wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the labor market
    would have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment of
    labor, a
      competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
      demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to
      bid against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade
      and increased
      profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
      upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented
      monopolization.</p>
  <p> With natural opportunities thus free to labor;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> with capital and improvements exempt from tax, and exchange released
      from restrictions, the spectacle of willing men unable to turn their labor
      into
          the things they are suffering for would become impossible;</li>
    <li> the recurring paroxysms which paralyze industry would cease;</li>
    <li> every wheel of production would be set in motion;</li>
    <li> demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with demand;</li>
    <li> trade would increase in every direction, and wealth augment on every
      hand. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></li>

way we are treating this continent.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That is the reason why people are

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">industrial depression</span></font>,
there are all over the country
thousands and hundreds of thousands of men tramping from place to

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not work enough! Why, what is

opportunity enough for work in this country? Supposing that, when
thousands of men are unemployed and there are hard times everywhere,
we could send a committee up to the high court of heaven to represent
the misery and the poverty of the people here, consequent on their
not being able to find employment.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What answer would we get? "Are
your lands all in use? Are your
mines all worked out? Are there no natural opportunities for the
employment of labor?" What could we ask the Creator to furnish us

power of working up this raw material.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>If there seems scarcity, if

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A few weeks ago when I was
traveling in Illinois a young fellow got into the car at one of the
mining towns. Entering into conversation with him, he said he was going
to another place to try to get work. He told me of the condition of the
miners, that they could scarcely make a living, getting very small
wages, and only working about half the time. I said to him: "There is
plenty of coal in the ground; why don&#8217;t you employ yourselves in
digging coal?" He replied: "We did get up a co-operative company, and
we went to see the owner of the land to ask what he would take to let
us sink a shaft and get out some coal. He wanted $7,500 a year. We
could not raise that much." Tax land up to its full value, and how long
can such <a href="Dogs_in_the_Manger.html">dogs-in-the-manger</a> afford to hold that coal land away from

Henry George: <a href="../HG/how_to_help_the_unemployed.html">How
to Help the Unemployed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1894)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>AN EPIDEMIC of what passes for
charity is sweeping over the land.&nbsp;<strong>
...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet there has been no disaster of
fire or flood, no convulsion of
nature, no destruction by public enemies. The seasons have kept their
order, we have had the former and the latter rain, and the earth has
not refused her increase. Granaries are filled to overflowing, and
commodities, even these we have tried to make dear by tariff, were
never before so cheap.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The scarcity that is distressing
and frightening the whole country
is a scarcity of employment.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small>Yet why is it that men able to work and willing to work cannot
find work?<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This, however, is the question
that the men of light and leading,
the preachers, teachers, philanthropists, business men and editors of
great newspapers, who all over the country are speaking and writing
about the distress and raising funds for the unemployed, show no
anxiety to discover. Indeed, they seem averse to such inquiry. "The
cause of the want of employment," they say, tacitly or openly, "is
not to be considered now. The present duty is to keep people from
starving and freezing, or being driven to break in and steal. This is
no time for theories. It is a time for alms."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This attitude, if one considers
it, seems something more than
strange. If in any village a traveller found the leading men
clustered about the body of one who had clearly come to untimely
death, yet anxious only to get it buried; making no inquiry into the
cause of death, and even discouraging inquiry, would he not suspect
them of knowing more of that cause than they cared to admit? Now,
this army of unemployed is as unnatural as is death in the prime of
life and vigor of every organ and faculty. Nay, it involves
presumption of wrong as clearly as cut throat or shattered skull.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What more unnatural than that
alms should be asked, not for the
maimed, the halt and the blind, the helpless widow and the tender
orphan, but for grown men, strong men, skilful men, men able to work
and anxious to work! What more unnatural than that labor -- the
producer of all food, all clothing, all shelter -- should not be
exchangeable for its full equivalent in food, clothing, and shelter;
that while the things it produces have value, labor, the giver of all
value, should seem valueless! </small><br>
<br>
<small>For willingness to work depends on what can be had by work and
what can be had without work, and the personal and social estimate of
the relation. Work is in itself painful and repellent.&nbsp; ... What
keeps any of us at work are our desires and hopes --
our wants and our pride. Kill hope and lessen desire by crucifying
the feeling of personal independence and accustoming your man to a
life maintained by alms, and you will make of the most industrious a
tramp. For the law of our being is that we seek the gratification of
our desires with the least exertion.
Why should charity be offered the unemployed? It is not alms they
ask. They are insulted and embittered and degraded by being forced to
accept as paupers what they would gladly earn as workers. What they
ask is not charity, but the opportunity to use their own labor in
satisfying their own wants. Why can they not have that? ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Charity can only palliate present suffering a little at the risk
of fatal disease. For charity cannot right a wrong; only justice can
do that. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet this is to be expected. For
the question of the unemployed is
but a more than usually acute phase of the great labor question -- a
question of the distribution of wealth. Now, given any wrong, no
matter what, that affects the distribution of wealth, and it follows
that the leading class must be averse to any examination or question
of it. For, since wealth is power, the leading class is necessarily
dominated by those who profit or imagine they profit by injustice in
the distribution of wealth. Hence, the very indisposition to ask the
cause of evils so great as to arouse and startle the whole community
is but proof that they spring from some wide and deep injustice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What that injustice is may be seen
by whoever will really look. We
have only to ask to find.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What do we mean when we say that
it is scarcity of employment from
which the masses are suffering? Not what we mean when we say of the
idle rich that they suffer from want of employment.&nbsp; ... Nor yet
do we mean that there is scarcity of the
natural materials and forces necessary for work.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; What
we really mean by
"scarcity of employment " is such scarcity as would be brought about
were an ice sheet continued into the summer to shut out the farmer
from the fertile field he was anxious to cultivate; such a scarcity
as was brought about in Lancashire when our blockade of the Southern
ports raised suddenly and enormously the price of the staple that
English operatives were anxious to turn into cloth.
</small><br>
<br>
<small>What answers to the ice sheet or the blockade? Need we ask? May
it
not be seen, from our greatest cities to our newest territories, in
the speculation which has everywhere been driving up the price of
land -- that is to say, the toll that the active factor in all
production must pay for permission to use the indispensable passive
factor. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>If there are any who do not see the relation of these facts, it
is
because they have become accustomed to think of labor as deriving
employment from capital, instead of, which is the true and natural
relation, capital being the product and tool of labor.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>So that, whether we begin at the right or the
wrong end, any analysis brings us at last to the conclusion that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the
opportunities of finding employment and the rate of all wages depend
ultimately upon the freedom of access to land; the price that labor
must pay for its use.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>... If three families settled a virgin continent, one family
could command the services of the others as laborers for hire just as
fully as though they were its chattel slaves, if it was accorded the
ownership of the land and could put its own price on its use. ...&nbsp;
Today, as the last census reports show, the majority of American
farmers are rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the first form
of tenancy; and the great majority of our people are landless men,
without right to employ their own labor and without stake in the land
they still foolishly speak of as their country. This is the reason why
the army of the unemployed has appeared among us, why by pauperism has
already become chronic, and why in the tramp we have in more dangerous
type the proletarian of ancient Rome.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">There
is but
one remedy, and that is what is now known
as the single-tax -- the abolition of all taxes upon labor and
capital, and of all taxes upon their processes and products, and the
taking of economic rent, the unearned increment which now goes to the
mere appropriator, for the payment of public expenses. Charity can
merely demoralize and pauperize,</span> while that indirect form of
charity,
the attempt to artificially "make work" by increasing public expenses
and by charity woodyards and sewing-rooms, is still more dangerous.
If, in this sense, work is to be made, it can be made more quickly by
dynamite and kerosene.</small>
<small>"Scarcity of employment" is a comparatively new complaint in the
United States. In our earlier times it was never heard of or thought
of. There was "scarcity of employment " in Europe, but on this side
of the Atlantic the trouble -- so it was deemed by a certain class --
was "scarcity of labor."</small> </div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But there is no need for charity;
no need for "making work." All
that is needed is to remove the restrictions that prevent the natural
demand for the products of work from availing itself of the natural
supply. Remove them today, and every unemployed man in the country
could find for himself employment tomorrow, and his "effective
demand" for the things he desires would infuse new life into every
subdivision of business and industry, even that of the dentist, the
preacher, the magazine writer, or the actor.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
country is suffering from
"scarcity of employment." But let
anyone to-day attempt to employ his own labor or that of others,
whether in making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, or
in erecting a factory, and he will at once meet the speculator to
demand of him an unnatural price for the land he must use, and the
tax-gatherer to fine him for his act in employing labor as if he had
committed a crime.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"

    themed collection of
excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WE talk about the supply of labor, and the demand for labor, but, evidently,
    these are only relative terms. The supply of labor is everywhere the same &#8212; two
    hands always come into the world with one mouth, twenty-one boys to every
    twenty girls; and the demand for labor must always exist as long as men want
    things which labor alone can procure. We talk about the "want of work," but,
    evidently it is not work that is short while want continues; evidently, the
    supply of labor cannot be too great, nor the demand for labor too small,
    when people suffer for the lack of things that labor produces. The real trouble
    must be that the supply is somehow prevented from satisfying demand, that
    somewhere there is an obstacle which prevents labor from producing the things
    that laborers want. <br>
            <br>
Take the case of anyone of these vast masses of unemployed men, to whom, though
he never heard of Malthus, it today seems that there are too many people in the
world. In his own wants, in the needs of his anxious wife, in the demands for
his half cared for, perhaps even hungry and shivering, children, there is demand
enough for labor, Heaven knows! In his own willing hands is the supply. Put him
on a solitary island, and though cut off from all the enormous advantages which
the co-operation, combination, and machinery of a civilized community give to
the productive powers of man, yet his two hands can fill the mouths and keep
warm the backs that depend upon them. Yet where productive power is at its highest
development, he cannot. Why? Is it not because in the one case he has access
to the material and forces of nature, and in the other this access is denied? &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html"> Book

  <p>NOW, why is it that men, have to work for such low wages? Because, if they
    were to demand higher wages, there are plenty of unemployed men ready to
    step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed men who compel that
    fierce competition that drives wages down to the point of bare subsistence.
    Why is it that there are men who cannot get employment? Did you ever think
    what a strange thing it is that men cannot find employment?&nbsp; If men
    cannot find an employer, why can they not employ themselves? Simply because
    they are shut out from the element on which human labor can alone be exerted;
    men are compelled to compete with each other for the wages of an employer,
    because they have been robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves;
    because they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
    paying some other human creature for the privilege. &#8212; <a href="crime_of_poverty.html">The

are constantly talking as though this "furnishing of employment," this "giving
of work" were the greatest boon that could be conferred upon society. To listen
to much that is talked and much that is written, one would think that the cause
of poverty is that there is not work enough for so many people, and that if the
Creator had made the rock harder, the soil less fertile, iron as scarce as gold,
and gold as diamonds; or if ships would sink and cities burn down oftener, there
would be less poverty, because there would be more work to do. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp08.html">Social

YOU assert the right of laborers to employment and their right to receive from
their employers a certain indefinite wage. No such rights exist. No one has a
right to demand employment of another, or to demand higher wages than the other
is willing to give, or in any way to put pressure on another to make him raise
such wages against his will. There can be no better moral justification for such
demands on employers by working-men than there would be for employers demanding
that working-men shall be compelled to work for them when they do not want to,
and to accept wages lower than they are willing to take. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The
Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII</a>&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
THE natural right which each man has, is not that of demanding employment or
wages from another man, but that of employing himself &#8212; that of applying
by his own labor to the inexhaustible storehouse which the Creator has in the
land provided for all men. Were that storehouse open, as by the single tax we
would open it, the natural demand for labor would keep pace with the supply,
the man who sold labor and the man who bought it would become free exchangers
for mutual advantage, and all cause for dispute between workman and employer
would be gone. For then, all being free to employ themselves, the mere opportunity
to labor would cease to seem a boon; and since no one would work for another
for less, all things considered, than he could earn by working for himself, wages
would necessarily rise to their full value, and the relations of workman and
employer be regulated by mutual interest and convenience. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

<blockquote>
  <p>You have heard much about various steps that should be taken to
    promote economic recovery. I propose this evening to concentrate attention
    upon one
      step, a step absolutely fundamental to permanent recovery of the sick patient,
      as distinct from remedies that dope the patient into a temporary hectic
    burst of activity; a step so simple and so basic as to be generally neglected.</p>
  <p>The one thing uppermost in the minds of everybody today is the appalling existence
      of want in the midst of plenty, of millions of unemployed in the midst of idle
      billions of hoarded money and unused credit, as well as factories and mills
      deteriorating for lack of use, of hunger while farmers are burning grain for
      fuel.</p>
  <p>No wonder people are asking what sort of a crazy economic system we have when
      at a time when millions are short of adequate food, when babies are going without
      the milk necessary for their growth, the best remedy that experts can think
      of and that the Federal Government can recommend is to pay a premium to farmers
      to grow less grain with which to make flour to feed the hungry, and pay a premium
      to dairymen to send less milk to market.</p>
  <p>Henry George called attention to this situation over fifty years ago. The
      contradiction between increasing plenty, increase of potential security--and
      actual want and insecurity is stated in the title of his chief work, Progress
      and Poverty. That is what his book is about. It is a record of the fact that
      as the means and appliances of civilization increase, poverty and insecurity
      also increase. It is an exploration of why millionaires and tramps multiply
      together. It is a prediction of why this state of affairs will continue; it
      is a prediction of the plight in which the nation finds itself to-day. At the
      same time it is the explanation of why this condition is artificial, man-made,
      unnecessary, and how it can be remedied. So I suggest that as a beginning of
      the first steps to permanent recovery there be a nationwide revival of interest
      in the writings and teachings of Henry George and that there be such an enlightenment
      of public opinion that our representatives in legislatures and public places
      be compelled to adopt the changes he urged. ... <a href="../docs/Dewey_Steps.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

How has labour got the land when it

saving or by borrowing some member of the family has gone across, and
their earnings have constituted an emigration fund for the rest of

not by capital supplied by the Government, but by capital earned by
the strong arm of labour. (Applause.) The whole development of the
United States, the whole development of every new country, proves the
fallacy of this assertion that labour cannot employ itself without
capital, and proves the fallacy of the assertion, that the opening of
land to labour would do nothing to improve wages. Go into a new
country where land is free; go into a country where the price of land
is not yet high, and there, you will find no such thing as an
unemployed man; there you will find no such thing as a man begging

Take this city, this State or

every man be free to plough, to sow, to build, in any way add to the

would improve, who would in any way add to the production of wealth:
Go ahead, go ahead; produce, accumulate all you please; add to the
common stock in any way you choose; you shall have it all; we shall
not fine or tax you one penny. What would be the result of abolishing
all these taxes that now depress industry; that now fall on labour;
that now lessen the profits of those who are adding to the general
wealth? Evidently to stimulate production; to increase wealth; to
bring new life into every vocation of industry. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the other side what would be
the effect when abolishing all
these taxes that now fall on labour or the products of labour, if we
were to resort for public revenue to a tax upon land values; a tax
that would fall on the owner of a vacant lot just as heavily as upon
the man who has improved a lot by putting up a house; that would fall
on the speculator who is holding 160 acres of agricultural land idle,
waiting for a tenant or a purchaser, as heavily as it would fall upon
the farmer who had made the 160 acres bloom? Why, the result would be
everywhere that the dog in the manger would he checked; for the
result everywhere would he that the men who are holding natural
opportunities, not for use but simply for profit, by demanding a
price of those who must use them, would have either to use their land
or give way to somebody who would. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Everywhere from the Atlantic to
the Pacific, from the lakes to

into the labour market that demand for the products of labour that

cease to hear of the labour question. The notion of a man ready to

  <p>If we just look at the &quot;ecological footprint,&quot; it's easy to be scared
    of the seemingly unavoidable damage we are doing to the earth. But seeing &quot;the
    footprint&quot; in terms of its components &#8212; subsistence, wealth, and
    illth &#8212; makes it clear that the fact of persistent and growing global
    poverty is not the inevitable result of population growth. I believe it&#8217;s
    true that the world cannot long support current levels of pollution, waste
    and habitat destruction &#8212; but these problems spring not from production
    itself &#8212; and certainly not from trade, itself &#8212; but from privileges,
    granted to individuals and corporations &#8212; things that we can correct,
  if we choose to.</p>
  <p> To solve the problem of land and justice is to remove unjust privilege, by
    instituting an economic system that rewards production and prohibits extortion. </p>
  <p>It&#8217;s all about the land: not only is land necessary for all life &#8212; land
    is also necessary for all production. So, as human population increases,
    and as the production of wealth gets more and more efficient, the demand
    for land
    goes up, and, of course, the land factories start cranking out more land!</p>
  <p> Wait! They can't DO that, can they? </p>
  <p> Wealth &#8212; products, widgets &#8212; these things are made by human
    beings. If customers are willing to buy more of them, then manufacturers
    will make
    more of them. But human beings can't make land. The supply of land cannot
    be increased. If the demand for land increases, only one thing can happen:
    its
    price will go up. </p>
  <p>The owners of land see population and production go up, up, up &#8212; and
      no more land. So, they will only put their land to use if they have an
    immediate need for the cash. If they can afford to wait, they will wait,
    because they
      expect the land's value to increase with time.</p>
  <p> That, in a nutshell, is the key to the land problem &#8212; the problem
    of poverty.</p>
  <p>That is why millions upon millions of people who are willing and able to work
    cannot find work, even while millions upon millions of acres of useable land
  (city land, industrial land, farm land, you name it) are held idle. </p>
  <p>This leads to no end of problems. In the United States, it brings urban
    blight and suburban sprawl, which disrupt communities, and waste energy and
    resources.
    You don&#8217;t think under-use of land is that big a deal? Consider the fact
    that in the five boroughs of New York City, 7.5% of its land, or 18.6 square
    miles, is vacant. That&#8217;s buildable land, not parks or streets. And, of
    course, a great deal more land in New York, as in every other city, is used
    somewhat, but far less than the local economy would support. New York City
    has about 80 people per acre of residential land. That means that New York&#8217;s
    vacant land could house another 956,000 people at current density levels,
    without even starting to use its vast stock of under-used land. ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Tip O'Neil, the former Speaker
of the US Congress, is oft-quoted that
"All politics is local politics." One might say the same of market
power. Some lands are sold or leased with covenants against
competition, as Gimbel's Department Store holds a covenant on a lot
adjoining its parent store on 3rd Street and Wisconsin Avenue,
Milwaukee.&nbsp; Such anticompetitive arrangements, however blatant,
are
intra-state, and apparently immune from sanctions under US Federal
anti-trust laws.&nbsp; Scholars of industrial organization, many of
them
doing outstanding work otherwise, pay these grass-roots matters little
heed.&nbsp; Researchers and activists concentrate on commodity markets
at
national and world levels -- the ones subject to Federal sanctions,
such as they are.&nbsp; They could probably find more severe and
blatant
market failure in local land markets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Bargaining power increases with the number of options one
has.&nbsp; A large
landowner with a chain of holdings in different jurisdictions is
positioned to bargain, to play off one against the other.&nbsp; Thus,
the
Disney Corporation, 1991-93, considered rebuilding and expanding
Disneyland at its current site in Anaheim, or in Long Beach where it
had tenure over another suitable site.&nbsp; Using this leverage it won
concessions from both cities, "finally" choosing to expand in
Anaheim.&nbsp;
It has yet to do so, however, and nothing is really final.&nbsp; Disney
has
many other sites around the world.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Likewise, land is a basis for oligopsony power in local labor
markets.
A city's labor pool is often faced with a local employers' association
whose membership is limited by the amount of industrial land within
reach of the labor pool.&nbsp; Migrant farm labor is faced with
statewide
employers' associations who have the advantages of limited numbers,
wealth, ancient roots and stability.&nbsp; Labor unions that organize a
local plant are faced with the threat of the "runaway shop", or merely
reallocating work among plants, when the employer owns plants elsewhere.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Custom has dulled us to it, but
a corporation is a pool of separate individual landowners bargaining in
concert.&nbsp;</span>
A century ago, corporations and limited liability were viewed with
suspicion and apprehension.&nbsp; Today, hundreds and thousands of
separate
landowners pool their corporate strength against labor, as a matter of
course.&nbsp; Some employees bargain through unions, but not as a
matter of
course, and hardly ever with international options.&nbsp; In the US,
less
than 20% of the labor force is unionized, yet many, probably most
economists treat labor as the only threatening monopoly.&nbsp; They see
corporations as benign; a prime cause carried by many economists today
is to eliminate the corporate income tax completely.&nbsp; <span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>VII. Economic Growth</b>
</small><br>
<small>Recognition of the equal rights of all to natural opportunities,
through land value taxation and its extension to charges for the use
of other resources, is not only just and efficient, but has the
capacity to make a major contribution to economic growth. This occurs
through a variety of paths.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The most important path is that
public collection of the value of
exclusive use of natural opportunities provides revenue that makes it
possible to remove taxes from the earnings of labor and capital. When
people are taxed less, they earn more. Using data that emerged from
changes in U.S. tax rates, Feldstein has estimated that the
elasticity of earnings with respect to the fraction of income not
taken at the margin by federal taxes is at least 1.0 (and more for
workers in higher tax
brackets).<font size="-1"><small><b><i>6</i></b></small></font> When
the entity that
removes a tax on labor is less than global, this action also attract
labor to the region.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When taxes are removed from
capital, the effect is even more
powerful, as long as the entity removing the tax is less than global.
Capital is extremely mobile in response to regional changes in net
returns. It is highly counterproductive for any locality or nation to
tax capital, because there will be virtually no effect on the return
to capital after taxes. Capital will merely be driven from the taxed
region until the return after taxes matches what can be obtained
elsewhere. If the whole world removes taxes from capital, the
resulting increase in the rate of return to capital will increase the
rate of saving, but the adjustment will occur over some years.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxing land has an additional
effect that increases the stock of
capital. A tax on land represents a redistribution from living adults
to the young and unborn, who will now be born with rights to land.
Unless there is a perfectly offsetting reduction in the desire to
accumulate assets to transfer to the next generation, this
redistribution will induce the living, who now have fewer assets, to
accumulate at a more rapid rate than they would otherwise do. That
is, saving and capital accumulation will increase.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxing land also increases the
efficiency with which land is used.
This occurs through three paths.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, a tax on land reduces the return to land
speculation, and therefore reduces the quantity of land speculation. </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, as taxes on land are capitalized into the selling
price of land, the result is the substitution of a recurring cost (the
annual tax) for a one-time cost (the purchase price). This makes land
relatively more attractive to bidders with high discount rates and
relatively less attractive to bidders with low discount rates. To the
extent that the former are more entrepreneurial and the latter more
passive investors, land will tend to flow into the hands of persons who
will choose to use it more intensively. </small></li>
  <li><small>The third path by which a tax on land increases the
efficiency with which land is used is that, for those who are using
land inefficiently, it substitutes an explicit cost (the tax) for an
implicit one (the income foregone by inefficient use). </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Psychologically, explicit costs
tend to be more effective in
motivating efficient behavior than implicit ones.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>VIII. An Estimate
of the Magnitudes of the Consequences of Taxing Land</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For all of the above reasons, the
substitution of tax on land for
taxes on labor and capital will increase the efficiency of an
economy. To estimate the magnitudes of these consequences, one needs
a model of the economy. Consider the following model. There is a
three-factor CES (constant elasticity of substitution) production
function:</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Q = (aT&agrave; + bL&agrave; +
cK&agrave;)(1/&agrave;). (1)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>where Q is output, T is the
quantity of land, L is the quantity of
labor, K is the quantity of capital, a, b and c are coefficients, and
&agrave; is related to the elasticity of substitution, &aring;, by
&agrave; = 1 - 1/&aring;. Land has a completely fixed supply. Labor
is assumed to have an elasticity of supply of 0.8 (adjusting
Feldstein's number for the fact that he was considering only federal
income taxes. Capital is assumed to be supplied perfectly
elastically. Taking the ratio of compensation of employees to Net
Domestic Product in National Income and Product Accounts, I assume
that labor receives two thirds of output. Somewhat arbitrarily, I
assume that the remaining third is divided equally between land and
capital. I estimate that the marginal tax rate on labor is 43% (28%
for the federal income tax, 12% for the combination of state income
taxes indirect taxes, and 3% for the Medicare tax--I treat social
security as having benefits equal to its costs, and therefore not a
tax.) I estimate the marginal tax rate on land and capital at 50%
(28% for the federal income tax, 12% for the combination of state
income taxes and indirect taxes, plus 10% for profits taxes). The
elasticity of substitution is a parameter that I am very unsure of.
But Feldstein has estimated that the marginal welfare cost of
taxation is 1.65, and I get that result with a &aring; of 0.68, so I
assume that &aring; = 0.68.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>I have a spreadsheet that takes
parameters such as the ones
named and determines what would happen (in a comparative static
framework) if all taxes were removed from labor and capital, and 100%
of the rent of land were taxed. Here are the results: 
</b></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The quantity of
labor would increase by 55%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The quantity of capital would increase
by 145%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Output would increase by 53%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The wage before taxes would
fall by 1.7%, but the wage after taxes would increase by 72%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The
rent of land would increase by 87%, and would provide more than
enough revenue for all existing expenditures of all levels of
government in the U.S., other than social security. <br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here
it's appropriate to introduce another grand claim - that unemployment
is simply unnecessary.</span>
We hold that the mass of idle unemployed should complement (and
mutually satisfy) all the many needs for more work - building better
housing, looking after pre-schoolers and the elderly, cleaning up the
environment, developing better infrastructure etc. etc. But why can't
they obviously come together? Unemployment is unnecessary - it's
economic insanity! This insanity only reveals itself in rare
situations, such as a national crisis (a war or natural disaster), when
suddenly the whole country can be "mysteriously" mobilised. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The main
reason we have unemployment is because we have a system of taxation and
land tenure which encourages speculation and discourages the production
of real wealth.</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">

is
enough to satisfy anyone. But here we want to make the point that the

qualities of land and its tax implications turns the economic system
the right way up, providing dynamic incentive rather than suffocation.

<small>If only the solution to this and other economic problems was
simple to
explain... Then the world wouldn't be in this situation, people
wouldn't be bamboozled by economics, and you wouldn't be reading this.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Of all economic problems, probably the most difficult to explain
is
unemployment, whose very existence is evidence of the madness of our
present economic system. On the one hand we have all the work that
badly needs doing, and on the other we have the countless millions of
people who are prevented from doing that work. All the conventional
think tanks in the world have not been able to solve this
straightforward puzzle, because they are handicapped from the outset by
their failure to distinguish between land and capital.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">MANY STRANDS</span></small><br>
<small>There are so many aspects to the problem of unemployment that
we've had
to take the long route, spiraling around and around until the big
picture is built up. We've examined many other aspects of economics,
but the problem of unemployment is such a curse - such an unnecessary
curse - that it's worth trying to get clear about it by pulling
together most of its strands here. Geonomics is not preoccupied with
making everyone work long and hard. In fact, we're convinced that we're
working far too hard for far too little return. Social justice,
prosperity and much more leisure time can co-exist.</small><br>
<br>
<small>A summary of what we've said about unemployment goes like this.
The
unique qualities of land are not recognised by neoclassical economics.
Whereas capital and labour are punished and discouraged by taxation,
LVT doesn't provide a disincentive but rather compels landholders to
use their land optimally. And with public sector investment, there are
endless employment opportunities arising from the way LVT recycles the
value of government investment back to the community for further
investment.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In agricultural areas of developing nations we see some of the
worst
examples of unemployment (or underemployment) and grinding poverty.
There, the power of land monopoly capitalism enables the traditional
landowning families to sit back and wait until the desperate landless
are forced to accept subsistence wages. The landless are landless
because they can't create their own land, the first ingredient in any
productive endeavour. But LVT would put the boot on the other foot,
forcing huge amounts of underused land on to the market and forcing
landowners to offer fair wages.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the West, it's more often than not the high price of land
which
stifles production and employment. The full collection of LVT would
actually eliminate that great obstacle to business and employment (or
simply living!), the cost of land. We have been stooged by real estate
dealers into thinking that high land prices are "healthy" rather than
crippling. The diversion of investment funds from productive
enterprises into purchasing land is another related cause of
unemployment.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">IDLE LAND, IDLE HANDS</span></small><br>
<small>Land speculation leads to idle land, and idle land to idle
hands. LVT
would prevent all forms of land speculation: would-be profiteers
couldn't afford to wait for the community to build up the value of
their idle land because all the time they would have to pay LVT.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The huge amount of present waste, inevitably arising from land
monopoly
capitalism, could instead be changed into employment-creating
opportunities. Such waste results from undervalued natural resources,
and can be seen in urban sprawl, in the huge inefficiency of our tax
system with its crippling compliance costs and all the attempts to
thwart it (including the black economy).</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;"The
earth is given as a common stock for men to labor and to live on ...
Wherever in any country there are idle lands and unemployed poor, it is
clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate
natural right"</span>. - Thomas Jefferson, (1743 - 1846)&nbsp;

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Left_Must.html">What the Left Must
Do: Share the Surplus</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What would you do if you could work two days and take five off? Write?
Play soccer? Tend to the community garden? Time off is an option made
increasingly viable by our relentlessly rising rate of productivity.
French Marxist and media critic Jean Baudrillard, while still advancing
the interests of labor, implores the Left to move on from seeing humans
as workers to seeing workers as human beings, with more needs than
merely the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling people
to live their lives more fully</span> is an issue made to order for
rescuing the Left from the doldrums that descended when &#8220;history ended&#8221;.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What would single mothers do with enough income to stay home?
What
would minorities do with the wherewithal to begin their own businesses?
What would communities do if they did not leak resources up to an upper
class and out to a distant lender or tax collector? What would the
elite do without our commonwealth?<strong> ...</strong> </small><br>
<br>
<small>The Left requests and the Right promises jobs &#8211; the Left for the
income, the Right in order to keep people in their place. Workers want
to be paid for going along with the program. Bosses want to accommodate
them, albeit not fully; maintaining some unemployment spooks workers
and keeps wages down. Since jobs are the knee-jerk cure
of everyone, they can not be the signature issue of the Left. Nor can
they lift our sights. The call for jobs does not come from a place of
respect but from a willingness to accept the status quo, with
prevailing hierarchy left intact.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To deliver a bigger pie, the
Right
touts efficiency and growth; to better distribute the pie, the Left
urges equity and jobs. Yet jobs are less for distributing, more for
producing &#8211; if that. As automation and globalisation expand the pie,
they contract the workforce. Even </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">when, or especially when, people take time
off to go to war, output increases, proving we&#8217;re well over
over-capacity. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Juliet Schor in
her </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Overworked
American</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> notes this </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">rise in
productivity does not bless us with leisure but curses us with
unemployment.</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>However, even when employment is high, jobs still do a lousy job
of
distribution. They capture less than a fair return to labor while
swallowing up our free time. Full employment with a liveable wage may
mean jobs with justice for some, but not for those unable to work, and
it reduces humans to workers, not players or creators. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demanding jobs rather than a
fair
share of society&#8217;s surplus implies that there is no commonwealth or
that expropriating it by a few is OK. Neither is true. </span>Rents
are real, and they are ours. There is a free lunch (just ask the
privileged), as those downing it do get money for nothing. And since
society, not lone owners, generates these values, that flow of funds
belongs to everyone.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Whenever George&#8217;s followers convinced society to shift taxes off
earnings, onto rents, that opened up opportunity. As collecting land
rent knocks down land price, and as speculators turn into developers,
and as formerly procrastinating governments become leasers, then the
use of land rises. Using land requires labor, raising the demand for
workers. More employment means higher wages. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As taxing land spurs
employment, taxing labor and capital does just the opposite.</span>
Taxing salaries makes it more expensive to hire people. Taxing earned
profits makes it more expensive to invest in firms that hire people. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you want jobs, don&#8217;t tax them. </span>Demanding
jobs while taxing wages is irrational. When we tax (or in other ways
reduce) one&#8217;s efforts, most people naturally produce less.&nbsp; Less
output not only shrinks private assets but also the formation of public
assets downstream.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlike taxing earned incomes,
which
shrinks the pie, collecting rent grows the pie. </span>While taxes on
effort lessen the motivation to produce, charging people rent for
what&#8217;s already been provided, by definition, does not diminish the
motive to produce. Instead, recovering rent removes the private profit
from speculating in land and
resources. And once we redirect revenue from sweetheart deals (e.g.,
Pentagon contracts), tax breaks (e.g., depletion allowances), and
subsidies (e.g., agri-business
support) into a general dividend, then why bother currying favours from
the state? Finding rent-seeking from both nature and the legislature
less profitable, investors would turn to improving production: new
technology and worker re-training, providing society more from less. </small><br>
<br>
<small>In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Nation</span>, Robert
Fitch
('90 Oct 29), author of <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Assassination of New York</span>(1993), stated,</small> </div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"A
tax levied on land used for commercial purposes is the ideal tax. It
would fall on the richest families and institutions, it can't be
shifted to consumers and owners can't move their property to another
state. Almost invariably, if you tax something the capitalists will
produce less of it and charge you more for it. But land is
different.&nbsp; Most of it was produced once and for all by God."</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Increasing taxes, fees, or dues upon land, resources, and
privileges
won&#8217;t force firms to raise prices; the ones who try to will lose
customers to those who don&#8217;t; in the end, all will have to settle for
smaller profits. On the other hand, de-taxing
labor and capital, by lowering overhead, lets firms lower the price of
their products, while competition drives them to. The resultant lower
cost of living &#8211; coupled with higher wages and the social salary &#8211; lets
those with enough stuff work less, so those without enough stuff can
work more.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Given the collateral damage by most taxes, the Left must make
clear
that the extra income is to come not from taxes upon people&#8217;s
legitimate earnings but from rent, making it a social salary from
society&#8217;s surplus.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> While opponents
will cry &#8220;redistribution&#8221;, the Left can point out that sharing the
commonwealth is actually &#8220;predistribution.&#8221; Acting like a REIT (Real
Estate Investment Trust) for the public</span>, government would merely
recover and disburse rents before the elite or their friendly
politicians have a chance to misspend society&#8217;s surplus. ... <a

Open Letter to Wayne Swan</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
"Great Australian Dream" now - as
in preceding years - has been to own your own home. </span>From their
earliest years of adulthood, most citizens have attempted to purchase
"a roof over their head." It used to be - no more than two human
generations ago - "a three-bedroom weatherboard - or brick veneer, if
you could afford it! - on a quarter-acre block in the suburbs." Most
citizens - then - succeeded in realising that dream; at least they
started repaying a loan that was large compared with their earnings.
Nowadays, it's quite impossible for most. Why? Simply because
land-price has escalated out of the reach of most. Allow me to give you
a specific instance:- </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">... </span><br>
<br>
<small>
As you can very clearly see, it now costs couples - or singles - a
great deal more to own a residence. Naturally, if they don't own their
own residence, they must </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>pay rent to somebody else ... or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>live in a caravan park or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>share a home with relatives or friends or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>have no place to call "home".&nbsp;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">None of these alternatives lead
to a
high quality lifestyle and undoubtedly are potent factors in separation
and divorce and reliance on drug abuse which, itself, leads to
anti-social - even criminal - behaviour. </span>We also know to our
great regret that these aberrations are becoming increasingly
prevalent. So is there a solution? And if so, what is it? </small><br>
<br>
<small>
In my opinion, there certainly is a solution ... but, seemingly, very
few want to know it. Judging by your article, I think you do. Here it
is:</small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern
conventional wisdom is that increasing land price signifies a healthy
economy. Exactly the reverse is true!</span> Increasing land price
demonstrates that much money is being invested in real estate and that
necessarily means that less money is being invested in productive
ventures. Increasing land price causes increasing rents ... because the
land owner must derive sufficient income to pay the interest charged on
the loan needed to buy the land and its improvements. This makes it
increasingly difficult for businesses to trade profitably ...
especially when there is a plethora of complicated taxes that cause
extremely high compliance costs. It's no wonder that more and more
goods are now imported as local manufacturers choose to close their
operations. In many places in Australia, land lies relatively idle. For
example, in Melbourne's CBD, several large blocks have been idle for
years and in the suburbs, shops remain empty for months, even years.
Yet government-released figures on unemployment - the reality may well
be much worse! - admit that unemployment exceeds 6%. The old adage,
"Idle lands cause idle hands" is clearly demonstrated in Australia ...
and elsewhere.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The only possible "winners" in
this
"game" are those who presently own land; the more they own, the more
they have the potential to "win". Land owners enjoy enormous increase
in the price of land they own simply because they were able to purchase
it when its price was comparatively low. They do not - in their role as
owners - contribute in any way to the prosperity of the nation. Indeed,
because they grow wealthier without producing, they are, in fact,
parasites! That sounds incredible but it is true nonetheless. How so?
Simply because those owners receive part of the wealth earned by all
citizens; at least some of that wealth is used to push up land prices
but only owners enjoy those increased prices. Tenants certainly do not!
All who labour - and this includes land owners who perform labour! -
are thereby effectively robbed of some of their earnings. (Please note
that I do not blame landowners personally; most would - I'm certain -
be horrified to think that they are <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">parasites</span>. The fault lies
in the
parliamentary enactments that permit such a situation to prevail.)</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Difficult as the situation is
now, it
will be worse still in another </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">two
human generations' time.</span> How so? Because the same forces that
have been exerted in the past continue unabated. In fact, these forces
appear to be intensifying! Taxation is continuing to escalate as
pressure groups clamour ever louder for financial assistance. The
average rate at which personal income tax is levied is increasing -
even though the maximum rate levied is falling - and sales taxes and
the like are being applied to a widening range of goods and services.
The wealthy continue to derive benefit from the tax-minimisation
experts they employ - because they save more tax than they pay to those
experts - leaving the relatively poorly-paid employees to carry most of
the burden. Unless, of course,
steps are taken to change these tendencies, Australia will become an
increasingly unpleasant country in which to live. That's definitely not
the future I want for my 3 children and
7 grandchildren. And I'm sure you don't, either!</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The solution to this conundrum
is,
perhaps amazingly, incredibly simple; namely, require all owners of
land - in fact, all natural resources, including intangibles such as
broadcast bands, to pay to all Australians, via the government, an
annual rental in exchange for exclusive ownership rights to those
natural resources. What could be </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fairer?</span> If a citizen has exclusive
ownership rights to a natural resource, that obviously means that all
others have no rights to it whatsoever. Therefore, that citizen must
pay compensation - in the form of a periodic rent - to all others. Now
that's a perfect manifestation of "user pays". How big is this periodic
rent? That's simply answered, too. It's what the citizens, generally,
think that natural resource is worth! And that's easily - and
accurately - determined by valuers, individuals who have great
experience because they simply note the prices at which similar natural
resources in the vicinity - both in space and in time - are sold then
use those prices to predict that of a similar resource.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
This would constitute real tax reform and - when implemented - would
obviate the need for income taxes and sales taxes. How is this? When a
continuing rent is charged for ownership rights to a natural resource,
that natural resource will have little or no purchase price. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Setting up a
business or residence will be much cheaper first up as only the
improvements must be paid for initially. </span>Money that presently
must be borrowed to pay for access to natural resources will become
available for productive purposes. Because rents will be payable on all
natural resources that are privately owned - whether or not they are in
use - those natural resources will become used or will return to the
nation as public land. Speculation in natural resources will be
immediately terminated thus eliminating a major factor in escalating
price. The converse of the old adage quoted earlier is apposite:- <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Far less idle land will translate into far
fewer idle hands! That </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">will
translate into a reduced need </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">for
social security expenditure. </span>Additionally, lower levels of
unemployment will cause reduced anti-social and criminal activity with
consequent savings in law enforcement, punishment and rehabilitation.
And elimination of most of our taxation regulations will cause
compliance costs to all but disappear. The brakes that presently retard
Australia's productivity will not merely be released; they will be
discarded! ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>To the
extent that property taxes discourage residential construction and the
improvement and modernization of homes they create unemployment.</small></span><small>
The housing construction industry employed about 2,200,000 people in
1962, that is about 1.4 persons per housing unit. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Any change in the direction of
home building employment is multiplied 2.57 times. </span>Thus an
increase in housing starts by 50% would give employment to 2.8 million
persons. An increase by about 66.6% or by 2/3 would create about 3.6
million jobs. These figures do not take into consideration the
investment in public utilities, streets, schools etc., that would be
required to service these additional housing units. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on
improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not
identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The paradox of property taxation
consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
