  <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Public
    Expenditure</span></div>
  <p>One of the beauties of forming communities is that through our common spending,
    we can together create amenities and provide services that benefit large
    number of people, which individuals would have great difficulty in providing
    or could only provide very inefficiently.</p>
  <p>Most public spending creates more value than what it costs. Spend money
    on a bridge, and land values rise on one or both sides of the bridge. Build
    a subway system, and land values within a significant radius around the stations
    go sky high. Improve the schools, and land values will rise. Provide trash
    pickup, and land values will rise.</p>
  <p>Judging a public spending project on the basis of whether it will produce
    an increase in land values equal to the cost of the project makes a lot of
    sense. For example, there are proposals to build a bridge to an island in
    Alaska. One guess at the current land value of that island places the island's
    value at about $450 million, and the cost of the bridge is about $223 million.
    So if building the bridge results in a 50% increase in land values, the cost
    of building the bridge will be covered! (And if building the bridge wouldn't
    produce a 50% increase in land values, does the project make sense?)</p>
  <p>Now we need to consider <em>who</em> it is that should pay for that bridge, and why
    the current owners of the 60,000 or so acres of land on that island should
    receive a windfall. If we believe that the federal taxpayer should pay for
    it, should
    it be paid
    for via a tax on wages and other income, or should it be through a federal
    tax on land values?</p>
  <p>Something to think about. </p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the Constitution
    of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence. To
    insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to each
    individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness &#8212; these
    are the proper ends of government, and are therefore the ends which in every
    scheme of taxation should be kept in mind.<br />
    <strong><br />
    As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
    limit. Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation, if
    the increased
revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which could not be done, or
could not be as well and economically done, by private agencies. </strong>Taxes could
be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps and disbanding
the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained in this way be for
the benefit of the people of New York and make New York a more desirable place
to live in? Or if it should be found that heat and light could be conducted through
the streets at public expense and supplied to each house at but a small fraction
of the cost of supplying them by individual effort, or that the city railroads
could be run at public expense so as to give every one transportation at very
much less than it now costs the average resident, the increased taxation necessary
for these purposes would not be increased burden, and in spite of the larger
taxation required, New York would become a more desirable place to live in. It
is a mistake to condemn taxation as bad merely because it is high; it is a mistake
to impose by constitutional provision, as in many of our States has been advocated,
and in some of our States has been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation.
A restriction upon the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter. In
nothing is the far-reaching statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown than
in his proposition that all public obligations should be deemed void after a
certain brief term &#8212; a proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident
truth that the earth belongs in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have
no control over it, and can give no title to any part of it. But restriction
upon public debts is a very different thing from restriction upon the power of
taxation, and reasons which urge the one do not apply to the other. <strong>Nor is increased
taxation necessarily proof of governmental extravagance. Increase in taxation
is in the order of social development, for the reason that social development
tends to the doing of things collectively that in a ruder state are done individually,
to the giving to government of new functions and the imposing of new duties.
Our public schools and libraries and parks, our signal service and fish commissions
and agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations, are evidences of this.</strong></p>
  <p> But while no limit can be properly fixed for the amount of taxation, the
    method of taxation is of supreme importance. A horse may be anchored by fastening
    to his bridle a weight which he will not feel when carried in a buggy behind
    him. The best ship may be made utterly unseaworthy by the bad stowage of
    a cargo which properly placed would make her the stiffer and more weatherly.
    So enterprise may be palsied, industry crushed, accumulation prevented, and
    a prosperous country turned into a desert, by taxation which rightly levied
    would hardly be felt. <strong><font size="+1">...</font></strong><br />
    <br />
    So long as we consider that community most prosperous which increases most
    rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity for us to tax wealth
    in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax what we want to repress, not
    what we want to encourage. We should tax that which results from the general
    prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is the increase of population,
    the extension of cultivation, the manufacture of goods, the building of houses
    and ships and railroads, the accumulation of capital, and the growth of commerce
    that add to the value of land &#8212; not the increase in the value of land
    that induces the increase of population and increase of wealth. It is not
    that the land of Manhattan Island is now worth hundreds of millions where,
    in the time of the early Dutch settlers, it was only worth dollars, that
    there are on it now so many more people, and so much more wealth. It is because
    of the increase of population and the increase of wealth that the value of
    the land has so much increased. Increase of land values tends of itself to
    repel population and prevent improvement. And thus the taxation of land values,
    unlike taxation of other property, does not tend to prevent the increase
    of wealth, but rather to stimulate it. It is the taking of the golden egg,
    not the choking of the goose that lays it.</p>
  <p> Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion.
    The tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It
    does not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost
    ease and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
  <p> Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>      Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
    of Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum
    Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. <strong>And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues,
    we would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</strong></p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p><strong>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</strong></p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: <em><strong>The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</strong></em></p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</li>
  <li>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
        of what some have to sell and others must buy.</li>
  <li>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
        it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</li>
  <li>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
        sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
        and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right
    to do.</li>
  <li>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
        thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the
    fairest division of wealth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
      <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
        of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
        octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
        duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
        on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
        the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
        be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
        need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
        deem a right one?</p>
      <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
        the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
        scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
        price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
        they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
        thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
        others.</p>
      <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
        of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
      <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
        are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
        that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
        the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
        effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
        buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
        gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
        of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
        sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
        it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
        of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
        instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
        of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
      <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
        show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
        intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
      <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
        a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
        to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
      <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
        the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
        of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
        in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
        of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
        reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
        always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
        user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
        pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
        the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
        or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
        to be a user.</p>
      <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
        of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
        what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
        to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
        community as a whole.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
            are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
            what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
            from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
            for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
            be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
            in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
            will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
            as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
            determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
            the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
            increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
            cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
            or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
            in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
            recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
            cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
          Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
              by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
              and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
              can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
          2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
          particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
          by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
          for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
          3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
          in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
          social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
          withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
            be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
            the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
            land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
            because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
            economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
            were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
            since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
            of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
            receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
            demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
            to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
            were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
            for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not

      <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
        of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
        to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
        impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
        it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
        by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
        artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
        that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
        most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
        enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
        temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
        innocent.</p>
      <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
        needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
        of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
        nourishment of the babe.</p>
      <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
        the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
        but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
        But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
        necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
        begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
        more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
        time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
        The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
        since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
        steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
        centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
        Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
        of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. <em><strong>To what
        is this due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations
        of those
        cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
        streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
        health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
        of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
        the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
        improvement, adds to the value of land.</strong></em> Is it not clear that here is a natural
        law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
        anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
        values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
      <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
        and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
        If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
        with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
        the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
        us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
        that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
      <p><strong>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the
          one thing that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue
          of which all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general
          improvements
        of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the
        dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
        </strong>Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of
        society is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society,
        is it
        not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
        while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with the
        advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each member
        of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from
        his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen
        relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
        the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
        the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
        should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater
        equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
        an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix: FAQ</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q2. Would the single tax yield revenue sufficient for all kinds of government?</em><br>
    A. Thomas G. Shearman, Esq., of New York, estimates that sixty-five per cent
      of the rent that the land in the United States now yields actually and
      potentially to its owners, would be sufficient. But whether it would or
      not is as yet an unimportant question. <strong>If all revenues ought to
      be raised from land values, then no revenues should be drawn from other
      sources while any land value remains in private possession.</strong> Until
      land values are exhausted the taxation of labor cannot be excused.</p>
  <p><em>Q4. What disposition would you make of the revenues that exceeded the needs
    of government?</em><br>
    A. The people who ask this question ought to settle it with those who want
    to know whether the single tax would yield revenue enough. I do not believe
    that public revenues under the single tax would exceed the just needs of
    economical government; in better highways, better sidewalks, better wharves,
    better schools, better public service of various kinds, we should find sufficient
    demand for all our revenues. But the question of deficiency or surplus is
    one to be met and disposed of when it arises. The present question is the
    wisdom and the justice of applying land values to common use, as far as they
    will go or as much of them as may be needed as the case may prove to be.</p>
  <p>    <em>Q5. If the full rental value were taken would it not produce too much revenue
      and encourage official extravagance? If only what was needed for an economical
      administration of government, would not land still have a speculative value?</em><br>
    A. In the first part of your question you are thinking of a vast centralized
    government as administering public revenues. With the revenues raised locally,
    each locality being assessed for its contribution to the state and the nation,
    there would be no such danger. The possibility of this danger would be still
    further reduced by the fact that private business would then offer greater
    pecuniary prizes than would public office, wherefore public office would
    be sought for purer purposes than as money-making opportunities. As to the
    second part of your question, the speculative value of land would be wiped
    out as soon as the tax on land values was high enough and that on improvement
    values low enough to make production more profitable than speculation. And
    this point would be reached long before the whole rental value was absorbed
    in taxation.</p>
  <p><em>Q55. Our city raises $20,000 for fire protection. Is it fair to tax
      land, which doesn't get that protection, and let houses go free though
      they do get it?</em><br>
A. Is not the land worth more with your fire protection than it would be without
it? Which would be better for the owners of land in your city, to pay the $20,000,
or to have no fire protection? Read notes 14 and 18. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q2. What is meant by the single tax?</em><br>
    A. The payment of all public expenses from economic rent, the normal revenue,
      thus eventually abolishing all taxes.</p>
  <p><em>Q3. What is meant by economic rent?</em><br>
    A. Gross ground rent -- the annual site value of land -- what land, including
      any quality or content of the land itself, is worth annually for use --
      what the land does or would command for use per annum if offered in open
      market -- the annual value of the exclusive use in control of a given area
      of land, involving the enjoyment of those &quot;rights and privileges thereto
      pertaining&quot; which are stipulated in every title deed, and which, enumerated
      specifically, are as follows: right and ease of access to</p>
  <p> * water, and<br>
  * health inspection,<br>
  * sewerage,<br>
  * fire protection,<br>
  * police,<br>
  * schools,<br>
  * libraries,<br>
  * museums,<br>
  * parks,<br>
  * playgrounds,<br>
  * steam and electric railway service,<br>
  * gas and electric lighting,<br>
  * telegraph and telephone service,<br>
  * subways,<br>
  * ferries,<br>
  * churches,<br>
  * public schools,<br>
  * private schools,<br>
  * colleges,<br>
  * universities,<br>
  * public buildings --</p>
  <p>utilities which depend for their efficiency and economy on the character
    of the government; which collectively constitute the economic and social
    advantages of the land which are due to the presence and activity of population,
    and are inseparable therefrom, including the benefit of proximity to, and
    command of, facilities for commerce and communication with the world -- an
    artificial value created primarily through public expenditure of taxes. For
    the sake of brevity, the substance of this definition may be conveniently
    expressed as the value of &quot;proximity.&quot; It is ordinarily measured
    by interest on investment plus taxes.</p>
  <p><em>Q57. Would the single tax yield sufficient revenue for all government
      purposes, local, state, and national?</em><br>
A. Careful estimates by Mr. Thomas G. Shearman indicate that all present taxes
amount to not much more than one half of the annual site value of the land. But
he said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The honest needs of public government grow faster than population and
      fully as fast as wealth itself. Local taxation will increase rapidly; and
      it ought to do so..... This does not imply that ground rent will not be
      sufficient to supply many, possibly all, of those additions to human happiness
      which Henry George has pictured in such glowing words. But such extensions
      of the sphere of government must take place gradually; or they will be
      ruinous failures, simply because the state cannot at once furnish the necessary
      machinery for their successful operation. ... <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Fancy comparing these healthy
processes with the enrichment which comes
to the landlord who happens to own a plot of land on the outskirts or
at the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the busy
population around him making the city larger, richer, more convenient,
more famous every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Roads are made, streets are made, railway
services are improved, electric light turns night into day, electric
trams glide swiftly to and fro, water is brought from reservoirs a
hundred miles off in the mountains -- and all the while the landlord
sits still. Every one of those improvements is effected by the labour
and at the cost of other people.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Many of the most important are
effected at the cost of the municipality and of the ratepayers. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">To not one of those improvements
does the
land monopolist as a land monopolist contribute, and yet by every one
of them the value of his land is sensibly enhanced.</span> He renders
no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general
welfare; he contributes nothing even to the process from which his own
enrichment is derived. If the land were occupied by shops or by
dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon them
in aid of the general fund, but the land may be unoccupied,
undeveloped, it may be what is called '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ripening</span>'
&#8212; ripening at the expense of the whole city, of the whole country, for
the unearned increment of its owner. Roads perhaps may have to be
diverted to avoid this forbidden area. The merchant going to his
office, the artisan going to his work, have to make a detour or pay a
tram fare to avoid it. The citizens are losing their chance of
developing the land, the city is losing its rates, the State is losing
its taxes which would have accrued if the natural development had taken
place; and that share has to be replaced at the expense of the other
ratepayers and taxpayers, and the nation as a whole is losing in the
competition of the world -- the hard and growing competition of the
world -- both in time and money. And all the while the land monopolist
has only to sit still and watch complacently his property multiplying
in value, sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on
his part; and that is justice!</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unearned increment
reaped in exact proportion to the disservice done. </span>But let us
follow the process a little further. The population of the
city grows and grows still larger year by year, the congestion in the
poorer quarters becomes acute, rents and rates rise hand in hand, and
thousands of families are crowded into one-roomed tenements. There are
120,000 persons living in one-roomed tenements in Glasgow alone at the
present time. At last the land becomes ripe for sale &#8212; that means that
the price is too tempting to be resisted any longer &#8212; and then, and
not till then, it is sold by the yard or by the inch at ten times, or
twenty times, or even fifty times, its agricultural value, on which
alone hitherto it has been rated for the public service. The greater
the population around the land, the greater the injury which they have
sustained by its protracted denial, the more inconvenience which has
been caused to everybody, the more serious the loss in economic
strength and activity, the larger will be the profit of the landlord
when the sale is finally accomplished. In fact, you may say that the
unearned increment on the land is on all fours with the profit gathered
by one of those American speculators who engineer a corner in corn, or
meat, or cotton, or some other vital commodity, and that the unearned
increment in land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion,
not to the service but to the disservice done.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
drag on enterprise&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="font-weight: bold;">monopoly
</span>which is the
keynote, and where monopoly prevails, the greater the injury to society
the greater the reward of the monopolist will be. See how all this evil
process strikes at every form of industrial activity. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The municipality, wishing
for broader streets, better houses,
more healthy, decent, scientifically planned towns, is made to pay, and
is made to pay in exact proportion, or to a very great extent in
proportion, as it has exerted itself in the past to make improvements.
The more it has improved the town, the more it has increased the land
value, and the more it will have to pay for any land it may wish to
acquire. </span>    </small></li>
  <li><small>The manufacturer proposing to start a new industry,
proposing to
erect a great factory offering employment to thousands of hands, is
made to pay such a price for his land that the purchase price hangs
round the neck of his whole business, hampering his competitive power
in every market, clogging him far more than any foreign tariff in his
export competition, and the land values strike down through the profits
of the manufacturer on to the wages of the workman. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The railway company wishing to build a new line finds that
the
price of land which yesterday was only rated at agricultural value has
risen to a prohibitive figure the moment it was known that the new line
was projected, and either the railway is not built or, if it is, is
built only on terms which largely transfer to the landowner the profits
which are due to the shareholders and the advantages which should have
accrued to the traveling public.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now let the Manchester Ship
Canal tell its tale about the land. It has
a story to tell which is just as simple and just as pregnant as its
story about Free Trade. When it was resolved to build the Canal, the
first thing that had to be done was to buy the land. Before the
resolution to build the Canal was taken, the land on which the Canal
flows &#8212; or perhaps I should say 'stands' &#8212; was, in the main,
agricultural land, paying rates on an assessment from 30s. to L2 an
acre. I am told that 4,495 acres of land purchased fell within that
description out of something under 5,000 purchased altogether.
Immediately after the decision, the 4,495 acres were sold for L777,000
sterling &#8212; or an average of L172 an acre &#8212; that is to say, five
or
six times the agricultural value of the land and the value on which it
had been rated for public purposes.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now what had the landowner done
for
the community; what enterprise had he shown; what service had he
rendered; what capital had he risked in order that he should gain this
enormous multiplication of the value of his property! I will tell you
in one word what he had done. Can you guess it! Nothing.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>But it was not only the owners of the land that was needed for
making
the Canal, who were automatically enriched. All the surrounding land
either having a frontage on the Canal or access to it rose and rose
rapidly, and splendidly, in value. By the stroke of a fairy wand,
without toil, without risk, without even a half-hour's thought many
landowners in Salford, Eccles, Stretford, Irlam, Warrington Runcorn,
etc., found themselves in possession of property which had trebled,
quadrupled, quintupled in value.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from the high prices which were paid, there was a heavy
bill for
compensation, severance, disturbance, and injurious affection where no
land was taken -- injurious affection, namely, raising the land not
taken many times in value -- all this was added to the dead-weight cost
of construction. All this was a burden on those whose labour skill, and
capital created this great public work. Much of this land today is
still rated at ordinary agricultural value, and in order to make sure
that no injustice is done, in order to make quite certain that these
landowners are not injured by our system of government, half their
rates are, under the Agricultural Rates Act, paid back to them. The
balance is made up by you. The land is still rising in value, and with
every day's work that every man in this neighbourhood does and with
every addition to the prosperity of Manchester and improvement of this
great city, the land is further enhanced in value. ... <a

<p>Clarence Darrow: <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">How to Abolish
    Unfair Taxation</a> (1913)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Fundamentally, all law recognizes the right to eminent domain, to take the
      portion of any human being for the welfare of the public &#8212; that no
      man's claim to any portion of the earth shall stand in the way of the common
      good.
      This is a common law, but in practice it only applies where a rich railroad
      wants to get the land of some poor widow.</p>
  <p>Everybody who works is poor; nobody would work if they were not poor, and
      nobody can get rich working. I never tried it, but I have seen others try it.
      <strong>The land boomer comes along and gets good car service to this poor
      man's home, and then charges him ten dollars per month instead of five. </strong>A lot of reformers
      are trying to get parks laid out in the slums, which only make the poor move,
      for they cannot pay the increased rent. The greater the population, the less
      the worker gets. <strong>As the land becomes valuable, more and more goes to
      rent.</strong>  The bigger the city, the deeper the poverty; the bigger the city the more degradation,
      there are the almshouses and gaols filled to overflowing. <strong>It is better
      for the men who own the earth to have big cities &#8212; but for no one else.</strong> Every
      man, woman, and child adds to the wealth of the land owner; the others must
      secure land upon which to live, and they must bid with each other for the right
      to live.</p>
  <p>... The single tax theory is that the public should take all the value of
      land, as it was made by the public. Land value goes up because of population,
      and not because of the owner of the title deed, and the value should be
    taken by the community, and thus create a natural fund from which to make
    improvements
      for the comfort of all, and thus make life easier. It would abolish poverty,
      that crime of the century, which has always come with civilization; inequality
      of wealth, which comes as the world grows older, and which we have never
    been able to cure, because man wants to hold what he cannot use, and pass
    on to
      future generations what they will not use.</p>
  <p>The personal property tax always was a delusion, a humbug, and a snare; it
      never could be administered justly. The conscientious man, the widow and the
      orphans (whose fund is in trust) pay in full while the rich get off. It is
      unscientific, it is bad as a fiscal measure. What we are after is the earth,
      and it can be had in an easy, simple, direct way.</p>
  <p>Every right-of-way of every railroad should be owned by the people; all public
      franchises, every mine and every forest, all should belong to the community
      itself. Then we would not need the repressive laws we have today.</p>
  <p>Men love peace, and if not antagonized, they will behave, and until justice
      is done in that good time to come, all the gaols on earth cannot make them
      behave. It never did, and it never will.</p>
  <p>The &quot;single tax&quot; is so simple, so fundamental, and so easy to
    carry into effect that I have no doubt it will be about the last reform the
    world
      will ever get. People in this world are not often logical; in fact, there
    is never any considerable number of them that are logical. I am pretty sure
    the

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> ... let us lay down and briefly defend the proposition that &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Taxation as a means of meeting the proper expenses of government is oppressive,
          unjust, inexpedient and unnecessary.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This proposition will strike a good many readers as absurd, but all must at
      least recognize the timeliness of the topic and the importance of any contribution
      to the discussion of a subject which is agitating the whole civilized world,
      for the methods, subjects and amounts of taxation are among the pressing problems
      of every country.</p>
  <p>The most obvious question which arises in the mind of anyone who reads for
      the first time the proposition above laid down is this:</p>
  <p>&quot;If taxation is unnecessary, what is to take its place? Government and
      its functions are increasingly expensive. They require a lot of money. Where
      is it to come from?&quot; The answer may be placed in the form of a second
      proposition:</p>
  <p>Every community, whatever its political name and extent &#8212; village, city,
      state or province or nation &#8212; has its own normal, unfailing income,
      growing with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary
      governmental
      expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners. <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong></font></p>
  <p> But before this time the reader, unless he has given previous attention
    to the subject, is full of objections to the above doctrine: &quot;How about the
        law?&quot; he is asking. &quot;Hasn't a man the right to buy a piece of land
        as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and hold on to it till
        he gets ready to sell?&quot; The answer is that at present he certainly
        has this statutory right, which has been so long and so universally recognized
        that most people suppose it to be not only a legal, but a real or equitable
        right. A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth of population
        in
        a city, for example, can buy a well-located block at a moderate figure
        from some
        less far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against
        all comers and give it no further attention except to pay the very small
        tax usually
        imposed upon vacant land.</p>
  <p>Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
      stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police and
      fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently that
      the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times what
      it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the very
      community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its taxes created
      practically the whole value of the land in question!</p>
  <p>It was said above that an individual has a statutory right to pursue this
      very common course. That was an error. The statement should have been that
      he has a statutory wrong; for no disinterested person can follow the course
      of land speculation as almost universally practiced, without feeling its rank
      injustice.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm land.
      Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot centrally
      located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by, say, Mr. John
      William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom.
      It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.
      There is a little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure
      ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
      subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's
      growth in which the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
      in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to, say,
      two hundred times its early value.</p>
  <p>About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and can't
      be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure of population
      is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public money to the benefit
      of this land must continue, he will not sell it. So he gives a twenty-one year
      lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a year net, with a privilege to the lessee
      of renewals at advancing figures. The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.</p>
  <p>Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which will be regularly remitted to
    Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever he may be, given in payment for? Not
    for
      the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does is to pull it down.
      Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock, which has got to be blasted
      out as part of its improvement.</p>
  <p>Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community, and
      the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the present
      $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command in later
      years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs to the community
      and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>
  <p>That the latter has no good right to it is at once evident when we remember
      that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody else has got to
      give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000 that some men and women
      have got to work to earn every year to hand over to a man who does not
      render, and does not feel any obligation to render, one dollar's worth
      of public or
      private service in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice which we
      call law. It is not comical only because it is frankly tragic in its social
      results.</p>
  <p>Now suppose this $20,000 and all the rest of this same community product &#8212; i.e.,
      the site or location rent of its ground &#8212; were paid every year to
      its rightful owner, the treasurer of New York City, what would become of
      taxation,
      with its inseparable retinue, Fraud, Evasion, Perjury, Inequality, and
      an all-pervading public sense of injustice? ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Indeed, one could say that the term &#8216;tax&#8217; is a misnomer because
    what is really involved is value created by the community being retained
    by the community rather than being appropriated by private landholders. <strong>For
    example, under current arrangements landowners receive &#8216;windfall&#8217; gains
    when the market value of their land rises as a result of publicly provided
    infrastructure being built nearby,</strong> or when local government zoning decisions
    reclassify their land as appropriate for further development. In this way,<strong> individual
    landowners stand to reap huge benefits at the expense of community-generated
    processes.</strong> Such arrangements create an odd incentive: allowing landholders
    to appropriate the unearned wealth generated by rising land values, thereby
    rewarding this unproductive activity, while taxing productive endeavour.
    The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217;, by contrast, would eliminate
    such perverse incentives and thereby more effectively align private and public
    interests in the use of society&#8217;s resources. ...</p>
  <p>Georgist analysis strongly emphasises landownership as a principal source
    of inequality. Because land is a strictly limited resource, its private ownership
    necessarily excludes large sections of the community from its benefits. A
    landowning class thereby gains political economic power. In George&#8217;s
    own time the social identity and power of this landowning class was distinctive.
    Those who could not afford to buy land were forced to pay rent to the wealthier
    few who could. By taxing the value of land, George posited that publicly
    created wealth could be recouped from the private landowners and redistributed
    throughout the community more equitably in order to address social goals.</p>
  <p>Are George&#8217;s arguments about land ownership and wealth inequality
    relevant today? Australia provides an interesting example, because land is
    the single largest item in national wealth. Laurie Aarons outlines the concentration
    of farming land in particular in the hands of a few very wealthy corporations
    and individuals &#8211; what he refers to as &#8216;corporate squattocracy&#8217; (Aarons,
    1999: 23). The relentless increase in urban land values in recent years has
    also produced dramatic redistributions of wealth. In the State of New South
    Wales, for example, land values increased by about $361 billion over the
    period 1993 &#8211; 2003. The existing land-based taxes clawed back only
    $44 billion in government revenues, comprising only about 12% of the land-related
    economic surplus. So 88% was retained as &#8216;unearned income&#8217; by
    landowners (Stilwell and Jordan, forthcoming). A higher rate of land tax
    with fewer exemptions could have substantially reduced this private wealth
    appropriation. This is not necessarily to posit the desirability of recouping
    100% through land tax, because that would certainly raise major problems
    of people&#8217;s ability to pay, given that much of the increased wealth
    resulting from land price inflation has not been realised as current income.
    But it is indicative of the current imbalance between private and public
    appropriations of the surplus arising from increases in land-based wealth.

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: Your academic work led you to formulate what you called &quot;The Henry
    George Theorem.&quot; This demonstrated that public spending &#8212; where
    this was efficient &#8212; generated additional rental value that surfaced
    in the land market. Other distinguished scholars, such as the late Nobel
    prize winner, William Vickrey, confirmed your findings. You also noted in
    one of your books, co-written with Anthony Atkinson, that the Henry George
    Theorem was attractive both because it was the revenue-raiser that did not
    distort private incentives and because &quot;it is the 'single tax' required
    to finance the public good.&quot; [Anthony B. Atkinson &amp; Joseph E. Stiglitz,
    Lectures on Public Economics, London: McGraw-Hill, 1980, p. 525] Now, public
    investment, unless of the wasteful kind designed to serve the privileged
    interests of rent seekers (the classic type being a land speculator), should
    be viewed as working in partnership with the private sector and not a drain
    on the community. How can the reputation of publicly provided services and
    investments be rescued?</p>
  <p>JES: That's a very good question. What we did when I was at the Council
    of Economic Advisors was some studies to try to show what the social returns
    would be to public investment in R&amp;D, etc. And we became convinced that
    the rates of return of those investments are very high. So you ask the question, &quot;what
    can we do to restore confidence in public investment?&quot; We need to realize
    how much we depend on them. I keep telling people, &quot;The Internet.&quot; That's
    one example. It was publicly funded. It's now a public-private partnership.
    The government did the basic research, and the private sector ran off with
    it. But, arguably, we would never have had the Internet if it were not for
    government expenditure. So I think a major industry in the United States &#8212; biotech &#8212; is
    based on NIH (National Institutes of Health). NIH does all the basic research.</p>
  <p>Q: From the conference on &quot;mondialization,&quot; I saw a major difference
    in attitude among the French with regard to public investment. The French
    believe strongly in public funds for public works, whereas Americans believe
    they shouldn't be taxed more in order to support public projects. Which view
    do you agree with?</p>
  <p>JES: There's been a lot of so-called &quot;bad rhetoric&quot; in this whole
    area. The real point is that we need to recognize that there are some things
    in the area of &quot;the public sphere.&quot; We're not having investment
    in basic research; we need to have the government do it. And that's what
    I've consistently been arguing; you don't want the government building steel
    factories. But you do want the government doing certain research, and the
    relative size of that depends on the society. Right now, we should be spending
    far more on basic research. So what is the message. I think how much we depend
    on the government. And the new economy, we take it for granted, but it is
    the public sector. I think you're right that we have the wrong view. But
    I keep saying, &quot;The Internet.&quot; How much as it changed our lives?
    And it's [the result of] the government. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

scary, even while the underlying economy actually lurches toward
recovery. If it weren't for the large declines in the (admittedly,
very important) financial and tourism sectors, the city's economy
would not be performing badly at all. <span style="font-weight: bold;">How
unfortunate, then, that New

turns out that land values

stabilization, provide no relief even in a weak market.</small></p>

for example, what would happen as a result of the elimination of
taxation of buildings. This decision, not to penalize people who
invest their savings in new buildings, leads to the stimulation of a
higher level of national income, higher saving, and the creation of
new capital. According to the study made by Tideman and Plassmann
(1998, The Losses of Nations, Fred Harrison, editor, Orthila Press),
shifting taxes off buildings, production and distribution, and onto

Justice</small></small></a>&nbsp; (1982)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Back in the early days of this
century, Winston Churchill saw and
recorded an example of this. There had been a ferry fare over the
river Thames for the common laborers who lived on the wrong side of
the river to pay in order to get to work. A spirit of nobility
prompted the absorption of this fare by the City, and almost
immediately rents in the working class area were increased by the
same amount as the fare had been. When this thing was done, the guys
who got the benefit were not the poor working class people, but the
owners of the homes in which they lived, or, more accurately and more
critically, the owners of the land on which those homes stood. The
laborers were thus charged a higher rent, and that rent diverted the
benefit from the seemingly intended beneficiary (i.e., the public) to
landowners in the affected area.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This occurs every day in this
country. A new road is built, or a
superhighway is constructed, which makes access to a particular site
much easier. We tell ourselves that we justify this as an
expenditure of public funds by the benefits that accrue to the
traveling public; but the benefits go, in the form of higher land
prices and rents, to the owners of the sites that are served by this
new road. If you doubt this, consider the jockeying for the insider
information or for influence over the selection.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Robert Caro, in his biography of
Robert Moses, recalls the time in
the early 1920s that Moses suggested to the authorities the building
of a causeway from the Long Island mainland over to Jones Island.
This proposal was rejected outright by the Long Island Park
Commission. Some months later, Moses presented them with a drawing
showing precisely where this causeway would run, and, after a
suitable period of during which these public employees could buy up
the land along the proposed highway, he resubmitted his proposal.
This time, they officially approved the suggested construction.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the town of Antioch, Illinois,
there were two developments
underway almost simultaneously. In the one, roads were provided,
together with water and sewer lines, but no sidewalks; in the other,
just across a main road from the first, the mayor of the city had
storm sewers, curbs and sidewalks installed at public expense, for
which of course, any prospective buyer or tenant would gladly pay for
use of that land the higher price these added benefits provided. Any
reader will recognize this chain of events and set of economic
relationships as being the course of everyday life and business at
the local, state and national level. <b>The cynic would say that a
primary motivation for entering local or even national politics would
be the opportunity for personal gain offered daily by publicly
financed improvements.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another example relates to a piece
of farmland in central
Pennsylvania. In the early 1940's, an 18-acre farm complete with a
two-story house with five bedrooms, a large barn that would among
other things hang 3 &frac12; acres of tobacco and store hay, straw and
corn on the upper level, with stalls for 6 milking cows and a half
dozen steers, housing for 100 laying hens and for fattening a few
hogs plus a shed for equipment &#8211; all in all, not a large farm by
local standards at the time &#8211; sold for $7,500. Twenty years
later, with about $12,000 in residential improvements, that land and
its buildings were sold for approximately $20,000. In those twenty
years, the neighborhood and the general economy in the county had not
changed a great deal. Within the next year, a decision was pending on
the exact location and routing of a new superhighway. The decision,
which was announced some time later, carried the route of the highway
via a bridge across the local road on which that farm was situated
and a cloverleaf access was built nearby. Soon, the value of that
piece of land jumped to $10,000 per acre, which, ignoring the value
of any improvements to the original piece of land, was an increase of
800%. That increase, from $20,000 to $180,000, benefitted the most
recent purchaser of the land. However, the increase resulted from the
effects of public (i.e., taxpayers') spending, and, in a more just
society, would have been returned to the taxpayers, rather than
accruing to the private benefit of an individual who either made a
good guess, had some private information, or even perhaps lobbied for
that particular routing of that publicly financed highway.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus, the benefits of a
tax-supported public work accrued once
more not to the benefit of the public at large, but to that of a very
limited and narrowly defined class, those who were rich enough to own
land in that location.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are undoubtedly many other
problems to be resolved before
the ills of our society are cured; but what many do not recognize and
understand is the primacy of the adoption of land value taxation over
all these other corrections. The reason for that can be very simply
stated: <b>If any of these other measures already adopted have no
merit and have only added to the burden of our problems, then they
are disqualified at the outset. On the other hand, if they are of
themselves beneficial, any benefit from them will be immediately
capitalized into land values and will therefore exacerbate the very
problems which otherwise might be helped toward a cure.</b> Thus it
is that our first step toward any possible remedy for the awesome
plight into which we have been led increasingly over the recent years
must be the adoption of land value taxation.&nbsp; ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>"French Equity"
(Equity in Kind)</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Under the Code Napoleon, a French
testator must divide real estate
equally among all children. Money cannot substitute for land; the
Code requires equity in kind. The resulting fine subdivision is
called <span style="font-style: italic;">morcellement</span>, and the
Code demands it without regard for
efficiency. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Each heir, in fact, must get an
equal share of land of each
quality: meadow, woodland, etc.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today we approach French Equity
indirectly, and expensively. We
distribute land haphazardly, but seek to make every parcel equally
good by extending utilities and roads to all parcels on the same
terms, regardless of cost or location. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists call such schemes
"postage stamp pricing," because
postal rates do not vary with delivery costs. Manhattan has 64,000
residents per square mile; Montana has 5.4. It costs a lot more to
collect or deliver mail in Montana. The reason postal rates rise is
that the U.S. urban population is spreading out more like Montana and
less like Manhattan (which once had over 100,000 per square mile).
Here are five other examples: </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small><b><i>The British Columbia Ferry Service.</i></b>
This socialized
system has two urban lines that make money, but the whole system
hardly breaks even, because lesser lines serve remote areas. The
worst costs $12 for every dollar of revenue. </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small><b><i>British Columbia Hydro.</i></b>
This socialized power
system
charges uniform rates throughout the Province. Users living in
high-density Vancouver are cheap to serve. A few live on the Yukon
border, where (I surmise) it costs hundreds of dollars to earn a
dollar of revenue. </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small><b><i>Water and sewer service in
Milwaukee County,
Wisconsin</i></b>. City investments have been captured, controlled,
and milked by suburban land development interests, helped by state
legislators. </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small><b><i>State university campuses</i></b>.
The legislative ethic
demands a prize, such as a university campus, in every electoral
district. Most of the eight UC campuses have excess land; some have
excess floor space. Sacramento solves rising enrollment not with more
intensive use of existing campuses, but with the costly creation of
new ones, each to enrich influential land speculators.</small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small><b><i>Water supply in California</i></b>.
The high real cost of
serving new settlements is passed on to older settled areas through
an accounting device called "melding," stirring all the accounts in
the same pot. Melding passes through several levels: a state
wholesaler serves the metropolitan district, which serves local
districts, which serve cities. At the end of the line, in Riverside,
it costs society $1800 to serve the marginal acre-foot (a unit of
water) selling for $20. This subsidy is worth fortunes to developers;
the cost is spread so others won't notice.</small></li>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Problems with French
Equity</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two problems with these
subsidies as an approach to
equity: they are not equitable, and they are wasteful. 
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equity
achieved by regional cross-subsidy is not interpersonal, but
interregional. It is like U.S. "foreign aid" programs, which tax the
poor in rich countries to aid the rich in poor countries.</span> Some
who
hold speculative land and enjoy subsidies are among the world's
richest people and cor-porations. Equity is not served by milking
middle-class neighborhoods to further enrich wealthy owners. "Public
works for private gain" is bad enough, but worse when profiteers are
already rich.</small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>How about waste? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Subsidy
creates waste in the amount of the
subsidy, almost by definition. </span>The New York Regional Plan
Association
estimates the social cost of creating a new lot on the urban fringe
at four times the lot's price (probably an underestimate). Why
develop a lot worth only one quarter of its cost? Because other
people pay the other three quarters. This process transfers ground
rent from areas of overcharge to areas of undercharge, but it
destroys much of the ground rent. To spread the surplus, we lose much
of it. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Has French Equity any merit? It
passed for a way to create jobs
when Keynes actually urged waste as a route to full employment. Those
ideas are now dormant, but we still do not understand the problem. If
we had to fire teachers or policemen each time a city extended
utilities to a campaign donor's raw acres, we would better sense the
true cost of public works for private profit.&nbsp; <span

Ed Clarke: <a

and the Practice of Public Economics</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>
  The Nation has long needed more effective decision-making mechanisms
  for intergovernmental coordination of expenditures and regulations.
  Efficient coordination can be achieved in an incentive-compatible way
  where the effects of spending by any one subunit on another subunit can
  be more effectively taken into account as compared with current
  decision-making procedures.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Effective coordination also relates to an important national
  economic
  policy concern which is efficient and equitable spending and deficit
  management. The need for better coordination is evidenced by fractious
  Congressional debate (ie.,. the Congressional debate over welfare
  reform) over how to implement acceptable reductions in
  intergovernmental transfers, accompanied by reductions in Federally
  mandated spending requirements.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Given the existence of decision-making mechanisms (ie., demand
  revealing) that would motivate decision-makers to accurately reveal the
  positive and negative effects of spending and regulatory decisions on
  one another, why not use these mechanisms to achieve more effective
  coordination? The Federal Government can establish an initial level of
  entitlements (called a distributional status quo) and then, with
  appropriate provisions for agenda-control, let the political subunits
  decide what levels of actual spending, including Federally mandated
  spending, is required. In effect, Congress determines the initial
  distribution but allows more implementation flexibility to the
  subunits, adjusting the financial flows to reflect external effects.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>To illustrate, I will assume we are applying the process to a
  subset of
  Federal discretionary programs (about $500 billion annually, and
  including National defense expenditures). Consider a subset of these
  programs consisting of about $55 billion in programs (transportation,
  communications and the environment) financed by Federal excise taxes.
  Assume first that, we take the President's budget and allow a "citizen's advisory committee" to propose substitutes or eliminations
  designed to "maximize the likelihood of minimizing harm" (a criterion
  elaborated by Bailey, 1997). Subject to oversight by a "Commission", it
  will allocate cost shares among political subunits (in this case
  Congressional districts) so as to try to equalize per capita (or
  household) net benefits among the jurisdictions (for example, by trying
  to make the cost shares proportional to estimated benefits -- see
  Clarke, 1980, Chapter V).</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Suppose that the allocation of beneficiary tax-shares resulted
  in
  pressures for spending changes that were nonuniform among the
  districts. For example, spending may be cut about 10% (from $550 per
  household on average to $500. Lower spending districts with lower cost
  shares might end up with an average of $450 while higher spending
  districts remained close to the original $550 average. Under the
  system, compensating transfers in the form of interest on expenditures
  of $50 plus a credit on the $50 principal would be made in the form of
  an accounting transfer from the higher to the lower spending districts.
  If the advisory committee recommended prudent changes that also
  generated large net benefits and the compensating transfers were
  designed to achieve equal or proportional per capita net benefit
  increases for each district (that, say also averaged $500 per
  household), then the proposed package of changes would be accepted
  unanimously. (The result is that, relative to the original status quo,
  the lower spending districts would be loaning $50 per household to the
  higher spending districts and sharing in the social surplus created by
  more productive investments).</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Perhaps such transfers may seem fairly insignificant in each
  household's budget. But what of the potential benefits to residents in
  any district if they carefully scrutinize the entire $500 or so in
  entitlements spent in or outside the district and can begin to effect
  self sustaining projects that are, say, financed through land rent
  increments and the appropriate marginal cost (user) charges? A resident
  that in no way benefits may be saving $500 per year with accumulating
  interest balances, accompanied by a significant incentive to make
  his/her preferences known.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>In the SEA paper referred to above, I explore the potential for
  various "federalist" arrangements to govern district and National spending
  decisions. They range between close approximations of Bailey's
"constitution" or "financial laws" to very simple, if less effective
  means of constraining rent seeking, means of determining interest rates
  to reflect disproportionate uses of Trust funds relative to initial
  entitlements (see appendix). The strongest incentive system, based on
  Bailey's work, is a use of the pivotal mechanism for agenda setting and
  combined use of the pivotal mechanism and the Thompson "preference
  revealing" approach in making final budget and regulatory decisions in
  a manner that will achieve efficiency while minimizing redistributive
  harm. (To illustrate the power of the Thompson incentive if budgetary
  conflicts reached a referendum stage, the citizen would have a strong
  incentive to reveal the $500 he is paying for a project with no benefit
  to him and would receive up to one half that amount in compensation if
  his less preferred option was chosen).</small>    </p>
  <p><small>I'm also suggesting a very simple moral to the story. No one is
    going
    to seriously move forward on LVT when people think they can get what
    they want largely for free. We need to live with that realization.
    However, we often have episodic periods of reform when broad, if
    discrete, administrative measures might be undertaken in conjunction
    with an eye towards instituting what amounts to benefit taxation.
    Imagine an alternative to a "Truth in Budgeting" bill that can take
    Trust Funds off budget (which failed by one vote in the last Congress)
    passing with the appropriate incentive-compatible allocation features).
    One might find those with a strong bent towards benefit taxation (like
    Dupont) working in tandem with those who have no strong ideological
    bent towards the benefit tax idea (like Turgot).</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>One can always imagine the results of one's conversations with
    an
    overly agitated Finance Minister (who despite their calm exteriors are
    often extremely agitated). Whether I've worked with one or more in a
    functioning democracy here at home, in an autocracy (Morocco) or in
    anarchy (Haiti), I often feel like a player in Waiting for Godot. The
    mood is captured late in Act I when Estrogen (the assistant) turns to
    Vladimir (the Finance Minister) and says: "Be Happy". Later (after
    considerable reflection), Vladimir replies: Now That We Are Happy, What
    Shall We Do? Later, Estrogen then says (not in the play): Let's Write
    That Memoir".&nbsp; ...</small>

    <p>            <b>1. Public works. </b>These enhance the value of specific private
            lands and so attract support from specific benefited landowners. At
            the same time they link new lands with old markets and, in the aggregate,
            increase the amount of land that is usable in more intensive forms,
            e.g. for urban housing, and thus have some redistributive effect in
            favor of non-owners. This makes
  for a wide constituency. </p>
    <p>Because they are durable capital they appear to represent real assets. However
      many are heavily subsidized or cross-subsidized and cost far more than their
      benefits to anyone. In the aggregate they freeze up too much of the nation's
      limited capital stock.</p>
    <p>Services are not inherently wasteful, and capital is not inherently economical.
      Economy is the key in either case. (When debt-financed, however, there should
      be capital resulting.)</p>
    <p>Capital is the more wasteful when we consider it is taken from the margins
      of alternative uses where it may be very scarce today. Labor, on the other
      hand, is in surplus.</p>
    <p>Anti-growth movements burgeoning today manifest growing disbelief in the
      benefits of subeconomic extensions of infrastructure. A small but growing
      element is increasing awareness of the high degree of absentee and alien
      ownership, highly concentrated, of the benefited lands.</p>
    <p>Squandering the Alaska surplus is a splendid case in point. A social dividend
      would have been efficient, and respectful of consumer sovereignty. James
      Madison's dead hand stopped it (in part). (Zobel v. Williams.)</p>
    <p><b>2. Subsidized public works
          in tandem with exclusionary zoning.</b></p>
    <p>Through revenue-sharing with categorical grants, many localities have built
      expensive public works, e.g. sewer plants, designed to accommodate higher
      populations. Then they turn around and impose exclusionary zoning, to limit
      the benefits to a few.</p>
    <p>In the B.C. Ferry Service the main lines make a little money and the branch
      lines to small islands are heavily cross-subsidized, some making $1 of revenues
      for $12 of costs. Residents of those islands, having sought and secured the
      service, are now alarmed at the influx of population and are zoning it out.</p>
    <p>Here we have public works turned into pure giveaways to a few landowners,
      with no tokens for any wider constituency.</p>
    <p><b>3. Hocking the revenues</b></p>
    <p>Borrowing to spend worsens the public works problems. Worse yet is borrowing
      to pay for current services, with some admixture of graft, as the NYC bankruptcy
      illustrated, and much 3d-world borrowing illustrates today on a wider canvas.

    <p>George saw land as a community resource provided by nature, to which every

      supply, the system of private land ownership allowed the wealthy few to
      enjoy exclusive rights to land and its benefits, while alienating the poorer
      majority from land ownership and forcing them to pay rent to landowners
      in order to access this necessary resource. Moreover, the collection of
      rents by landowners allowed them to increase their wealth without contributing
      to the productive efforts of society. As the population grew, so too did
      the demand for land, forcing rents and land values ever higher. In addition,
      increases in land value resulting from publicly-funded developments, such
      as roads and public transport systems, unduly benefited landowners at the
      expense of the community. Such unearned gains from landownership encouraged

  <blockquote>
    <p>The market price of a location depends not only on ground rent and taxes,
      effectively its present value, but also upon the &#8220;discount rate,&#8221; or
      interest rate, that prevails in the market used to calculate its returns
      and costs. When interest rates go up, the market prices of sites fall,
      just as for any other economic encumbrances placed on locational sites.</p>
    <p>The market prices of sites also fall if taxes go up and nothing else changes.
      However, an increase in taxes is often accompanied by improvements in any
      obligations linked to parcel locations. These too are sometimes easily &#8220;commodified,&#8221;26
      and may vary according to time period, changed neighborhood expectations,
      emergency conditions, government regulations, and so on.27 These contingent
      links often constitute services that raise the market prices of sites more
      than the taxes depress them. Still another way of understanding the value
      of locations is to see them as capitalized transportation costs.28 Savings
      in transportation are likely to be expressed in the market price of sites.
      One way or another people are willing to pay for access to exchange markets:
      either in the form of site proximity or in the form of travel expenses.
      It is the reason why urban cores have higher site rents than peripheral
      areas and hinterlands. Hence the differential value of locations, dependent,
      not on anything titleholders do, but rather on the quality of <strong>community
      amenities.</strong> These all have a price.</p>
    <p><strong>The prices for services that raise land rents</strong>, like the services themselves,
      should be regarded as flows rather than as stocks. But, ironically, our
      payments for such services are not understood as flows affecting site values
      at all, but are seen rather as related to stock prices. The values of our
      property parcels are viewed solely as stocks, and therefore our taxes are
      seen as stock taxes. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>
