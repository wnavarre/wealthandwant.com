      <p>&quot;Seeing the cat&quot;
        is Georgist shorthand for the &quot;aha!&quot; moment when one starts
        to see how the distortions of our current way of treating the rent on
        land as
        mostly private property ripple throughout society, creating a huge range
        of
          social
          and justice problems.&nbsp; A lot of things that individually make
          no sense, and which popular academic economics theories fail
          to explain, fall into
          place and form a cohesive whole.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>I hope this website will help you have  that &quot;aha!&quot; moment
        for yourself, and then to share it with others.&nbsp; When enough of
        us come to understand the underpinnings of our current problems, and
        that
        there
        is a simple and just alternative, we can together set about creating
        the society that our founding fathers' words spoke of.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
      That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of
    wealth, to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all
    the fruits
      of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. We have been advancing as
    through an enemy's country, in which every step must be secured, every position
    fortified,
      and every bypath explored; for this simple truth, in its application to
    social and political problems, is hid from the great masses of men partly
    by its very
      simplicity, and in greater part by widespread fallacies and erroneous habits
      of thought which lead them to look in every direction but the right one
    for an explanation of the evils which oppress and threaten the civilized
    world.
      And back of these elaborate fallacies and misleading theories is an active,
      energetic power, a power that in every country, be its political forms
    what they may, writes laws and molds thought &#8212; the power of a vast
    and dominant pecuniary interest.</p>
  <p>But so simple and so clear is this truth, that to see it fully once is always
      to recognize it. There are pictures which, though looked at again and again,
      present only a confused labyrinth of lines or scroll work &#8212; a landscape,
      trees, or something of the kind &#8212; until once the attention is called
      to the fact that these things make up a face or a figure. This relation,
      once recognized, is always afterward clear.*</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">*Hence the expression, current among adherents of Henry
            George's proposal: &quot;Do you see the cat?&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>... For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which he must
      draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied
    for the
      supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,
      the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized,
    without the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it
    we live,
      to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
      of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
      to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. Material progress cannot rid
      us of
      our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing wealth
      from land; and hence, when land is monopolized, it might go on to infinity
      without
      increasing wages or improving the condition of those who have but their
      labor. It can but add to the value of land and the power which its possession
      gives.
      Everywhere, in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is
      the base of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the source of
      power.

<blockquote>
  <p>    A man was walking down a shopping street and came to a store
    window where there was a big drawing full of lines and squiggles. A
    sign by the drawing asked, "Can you see the picture?" </p>
  <p> All the man could see was a chaos of lines going every which way. He stared
      at it and tried to make out some kind of design, but it was all a jumble. Then
      he saw that some of the lines formed ears, and whiskers, and a tail. Suddenly
      he realized that there was a cat in the picture. Once he saw the cat, it was
      unmistakable. When he looked away and then looked back at the drawing, the
      cat was quite evident now. </p>
  <p> The man then realized that the economy is like the cat. It seems to be a
      jumble of workers, consumers, enterprises, taxes, regulations, imports and
      exports, profits and losses - a chaos of all kinds of activities. Here are
      fine houses and shops full of goods, but yonder is poverty and slums. It doesn't
      make any sense unless we understand the basic principles of economics. Once
      we have this understanding, the economy becomes clear -- we see the cat instead
      of a jumble. We then know the cause of poverty and its remedy. But since most
      folks don't see the cat, social policy just treats the symptoms without applying
      the remedies that would eliminate the problem. </p>
  <p> What is this economics cat? It starts with the three factors or resource
      inputs of production: land, labor, and capital goods. <strong>... </strong></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
When I taught at the <a href="http://www.henrygeorgeschool.org/">Henry
George School in New York</a>, our
Director, George Collins, used to give a stirring graduation speech
to students. He told them they would find that the gift of insight
they'd been given, in studying Georgist political economy, was also a
kind of curse: they would never look upon their city with the same
eyes. The land question and its ramifications, the malignant
absurdities of today's economic systems and the sheer obviousness of
the remedy, would shout at them in every day's news.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I was reminded of that when I recently visited New York. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists note in this budget
crunch, as in others the city has
faced, a curious disconnect between the fiscal crisis and the overall
economy. Tax receipts are way down and the budget outlook is indeed
scary, even while the underlying economy actually lurches toward
recovery. If it weren't for the large declines in the (admittedly,
very important) financial and tourism sectors, the city's economy
would not be performing badly at all. <span style="font-weight: bold;">How
unfortunate, then, that New
York will see no other alternative than to choke off economic
recovery by raising income and sales taxes while cutting back on
public services. But what can they do? The tax base is declining.</span></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Or is it? It
turns out that land values
in New York, while
modestly down in some areas, have not taken anywhere near the beating
that the Stock Market has, or the small business community, or public
services. No, the real estate market in New York City remains, all in
all, quite bullish. There are few bargains to be had. Residential
rents, of course, having been held artificially low by rent
stabilization, provide no relief even in a weak market.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So, no &#8212; despite the dire
warnings, New York City need not endure
a fiscal crisis. Its tax base &#8212; properly defined &#8212; is robustly
capable of providing for public needs, while actually bringing
business into the city. <span style="font-weight: bold;">They have
just been taxing the wrong things,
all along. Tourists, bulls and bears come and go, but New York City's
land values &#8212; like its citizens &#8212; are quite resilient.</span></small>

<blockquote>
  <p>All this makes for a far simpler and more comprehensible system of taxation.
      Land taxes are totally transparent, impossible to evade, and therefore
    much more administrable. This further engenders the legitimacy of taxation
    and of
      government itself. What it also does is assure stability to the tax system,
      for the reason that land values are not subject to the variations and vacillations
      that other tax bases frequently have. Indeed, the removal of economic rent
      from locational sites discourages speculative bubbles and the related economic
      cycles that are associated with them. This greater stability and reliability
      is to the advantage of every sector of the economy &#8212; private, public,
      and non-profit.</p>
  <p>A tax that collects economic rent offers a win-win proposition to every
    sector of the community &#8212; except to those who speculate in land. But
    who wants to favor land speculators? They are not held in high regard anywhere;
    their
      destructive behavior is the bane of cities, recognized everywhere for what
      it is: parasitic and passive. Speculators provide no added value to a community's
      well-being, and taxing rent is a foolproof means by which to eliminate
    it. Land speculation is highest where the most rent can be privately captured,
      but it forces those who choose to develop to look to sub-optimal locations
      when the primary locations they hoped for are held off the market for opportunistic
      gain. By collecting rent, primary choice locations become available for
    use
      and to facilitate the development of land use configurations ideal for
    the economic health and efficient allocation. Urban ambience is improved,
    public
      sector service costs are reduced, and sprawl development is stemmed.</p>
  <p>In the final analysis cities have no reason to complain other than by being
      hoodwinked by an economics profession that went off track a century ago and
      has seen its own disciples unable to take off the veil.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[23]</em></strong></font> It
      was then that economic theory was altered to treat land as simply another
      form of capital, changed to formulas based on two factors of production
      rather than
      three, and disposing of the notion of economic rent altogether. Henry George,
      the last passionate defender of the classical economic tradition a century
      ago, lost his fight to preserve three-factor economics. But there are many
      still who appreciate the value, even the truth, of his insight and analysis.
      Today we have the computer power to test these ideas and to demonstrate
      their validity. There is an oft retold story among adherents of the Georgist
      school
      referred to as &quot;seeing the cat.&quot; ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p> <strong><font size="-1">IV. CONCLUSION </font></strong> </p>
  <p>In &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; after reaching his conclusion that
    command of the land which is necessary for labor is command of all the fruits
    of labor save enough to enable labor to exist, Henry George says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>So simple and so clear is this truth that to fully see it once is always
      to recognize it. There are pictures which, though looked at again and again,
      present only a confused labyrinth of lines or scroll-work &#8212; a landscape,
      trees, or something of the kind &#8212; until once attention is called
      to the fact that these things make up a face or a figure. This relation
      once recognized is always afterward clear. 111 It is so in this case. In
      the light of this truth all social facts group themselves in an orderly
      relation, and the most diverse phenomena are seen to spring from one great
      principle.</p>
    <p> <font size="-1">111. This idea of the concealed picture was graphically
        illustrated with a story by Congressman James G. Maguire, at that time
        a Judge of the Superior Court of San Francisco, in a speech at the Academy
        of Music, New York City, in 1887. In substance he said:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I was one day walking along Kearney Street in San
        Francisco, when I noticed a crowd around the show window of a store,
        looking at something inside. I took a glance myself and saw only a very
        poor picture of a very uninteresting landscape. But as I was turning
        away my eye caught the words underneath the picture, 'Do you see the
        cat?' I looked again and more closely, but saw no cat in the picture.
        Then I spoke to the crowd.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Gentlemen,' I said, 'I see no cat in that picture.
        Is there a cat there?'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Some one in the crowd replied:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Naw, there ain't no cat there. Here's a crank who
        says he sees the cat, but nobody else can see it.'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Then the crank spoke up:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">'I tell you there is a cat there, too. It's all cat. What
        you fellows take for a landscape is just nothing more than the outlines
        of a cat. And you needn't call a man a crank either, because he can see
        more with his eyes than you can.'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well,&quot; the judge continued, &quot;I looked
        very closely at the picture, and then I said to the man they called a
        crank:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Really, sir, I cannot make out a cat. I can see
        nothing but a poor picture of a landscape.'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Why, judge,' he exclaimed, 'just look at that bird
        in the air. That's the cat's ear.'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">I looked, but was obliged to say:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">'I am sorry to be so stupid, but I can't make a cat's
        ear of that bird. It is a poor bird, but not a cat's ear.'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;'Well, then,' the crank urged, 'look at that twig
        twirled around in a circle. That's the cat's eye.'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">But I couldn't make an eye of it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">'Oh, then,' said the crank a little impatiently, 'look
        at those sprouts at the foot of the tree, and the grass. They make the
        cat's claws.'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;After another deliberate examination, I reported
        that they did look a little like a claw, but I couldn't connect them
        with a cat.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Once more the crank came back at me. 'Don't you
        see that limb off there? and that other limb under it? and that white
        space between? Well, that white space is the cat's tail.'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I looked again and was just on the point of replying
        that there was no cat there so far as I could see, when suddenly the
        whole cat burst upon me. There it was, sure enough, just as the crank
        had said; and the only reason that the rest of us couldn't see it was
        that we hadn't got the right point of view. But now that I saw it I could
        see nothing else in the picture. The landscape had disappeared and a
        cat had taken its place. And, do you know, I was never afterward able,
        upon looking at that picture, to see anything in it but the cat!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">From this story as told by Judge Maguire, has come the
        slang of the single tax agitation. To &quot;see the cat &quot; is to
        understand the single tax.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Many events subsequent to his writing have gone to prove that Henry George
    was right. Each new phase of the social problem makes it still more clear
    that the disorderly development of our civilization is explained, not by
    pressure of population, nor by the superficial relations of employers and
    employed, nor by scarcity of money, nor by the drinking habits of the poor,
    nor by individual differences in ability to produce wealth, nor by an incompetent
    or malevolent Creator, but, as he has said, by &quot;inequality in the ownership
    of land.&quot; And each new phase makes it equally clear that the remedy
    for poverty is not to be found in famine and disease and war, nor in strikes
    which are akin to war, nor in the suppression of strikes by force of arms,
    nor in the coinage of money, nor in prohibition or high license, nor in technical
    education, nor in anything else short of approximate equality in the ownership
    of land. This alone secures equal opportunities to produce, and full ownership
    by each producer of his own product. This is justice, this is order. And
    unless our civilization have it for a foundation, new forms of slavery will
    assuredly lead us into new forms of barbarism.112</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">112. &quot;Our primary social adjustment is a denial of
        justice. In allowing one man to own the land on which and from which
        other men must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a degree which
        increases as material progress goes on. This is the subtile alchemy that
        in ways they do not realize is extracting from the masses in every civilized
        country the fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting a harder
        and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been destroyed;
        that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom, and must
        soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;It is this that turns the blessings of material
        progress into a curse. It is this that crowds human beings into noisome
        cellars and squalid tenement houses; that fills prisons and brothels;
        that goads men with want and consumes them with greed; that robs women
        of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood; that takes from little
        children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Civilization so based cannot continue. The eternal
        laws of the universe forbid it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the
        witness that is in every soul answers, that it cannot be. It is something
        grander than Benevolence, something more august than Charity &#8212; it
        is justice herself that demands of us to right this wrong. justice that
        will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; justice that with
        the scales carries the sword.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book
