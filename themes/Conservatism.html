            no obligation to maintain an unchanged policy through out all future
            time. </strong>Public policies are constantly changing in such ways
            as to disappoint the expectations of persons who have invested on
            the supposition
            that policies would not change and to affect the value of their property.
            Tarriffs are raised, and lowered. The brewing of spirituous liquors

            monopolized services are first left to be fixed by the monopolist
            and are then regulated. Taxes are increased on some goods and decreased
            on others. In some communities taxes have already been made higher
            on land values than on improvements. Purchasers of land have no right
            to insist that society may not, even by gradual steps, discriminate
            in taxation against land rent, which is an income socially produced.
            (Henry George himself elsewhere said -- Century Magazine, July, 1890
            -- that &quot;we cannot get to the Single Tax at one leap, but only
            by gradual steps.&quot;) We must presume that land owners, like other
            persons, buy their property with no guarantee that public policy
            will never change. <strong>The conservative insistence that society,

  <p><strong><em>f. The Single Tax Retains Rent for Common Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>To retain Rent for common use it is not necessary to abolish land-titles,
    nor to let land out to the highest bidder, nor to invent some new mechanism
    of taxation, nor in any other way to directly change existing modes of holding
    land for use, or existing machinery for collecting public revenues. &quot;Great
    changes can be best brought about under old forms.&quot;109 Let land be held
    nominally as it is now. Let taxes be collected by the same kind of machinery
    as now. But abolish all taxes except those that fall upon actual and potential
    Rent, that is to say, upon land values.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1"><strong>109. &quot;Such dupes are men to custom, and so
          prone<br />
    To rev'rence what is ancient and can plead<br />

    That even servitude, the worst of ills,<br />
    Because delivered down from sire to son<br />
    Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing.&quot; &#8212;Cowper.</strong></font></p>
    <p><strong><font size="-1">It is only custom that makes the ownership of
          land seem reasonable</font></strong><font size="-1">. I have frequently had occasion to tell of the necessity under
        which the city of Cleveland, Ohio, found itself, of paying a land-owner
        several thousand dollars for the right to swing a bridge-draw over his
        land. When I described the matter in that way, the story attracted no
        attention; it seemed perfectly reasonable to the ordinary lecture audience.
        But when I described the transaction as a payment by the city to a land-owner
        of thousands of dollars for the privilege of swinging the draw &quot;through
        that man's air,&quot; the audience invariably manifested its appreciation
        of the absurdity of such an ownership. <strong>The idea of owning air was ridiculous;
        the idea of owning land was not. Yet who can explain the difference,
        except as a matter of custom?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">To the same effect was the question of the Rev. F. L.
        Higgins to a friend. While stationed at Galveston, Tex., Mr. Higgins
        fell into a discussion with his friend as to the right of government
        to make land private property. The friend argued that no matter what
        the abstract right might be, the government had made private property
        of land, and people had bought and sold upon the strength of the government
        title, and therefore land titles were morally absolute.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Suppose,&quot; said Mr. Higgins, &quot;that the
        government should vest in a corporation title to the Gulf of Mexico,
        so that no one could fish there, or sail there, or do anything in or
        upon the waters of the Gulf without permission from the corporation.
        Would that be right?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No,&quot; answered the friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Well, suppose the corporation should then parcel
        out the Gulf to different parties until some of the people came to own
        the whole Gulf to the exclusion of everybody else, born and unborn. Could
        any such title be acquired by these purchasers, or their descendants
        or assignees, as that the rest of the people if they got the power would
        not have a moral right to abrogate it?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said the friend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Could private titles to the Gulf possibly become
        absolute in morals?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;No.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Then tell me,&quot; asked Mr. Higgins, &quot;what
        difference it would make if all the water were taken off the Gulf and
        only the bare land left.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> If that were done it is doubtful if land-owners could any longer confiscate
    enough Rent to be worth the trouble. Even though some surplus were still
    kept by them, it would be so much more easy to secure Wealth by working for
    it than by confiscating Rent to private use, to say nothing of its being
    so much more respectable, that speculation in land values would practically
    be abandoned. At any rate, the question of a surplus &#8212; Rent in excess
    of the requirements of the community &#8212; may be readily determined when
    the principle that Rent justly belongs to the community and Wages to the
    individual shall have been recognized by society in the adoption of the Single
    Tax. 110</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One way to sidestep the lack of disinterested
    parties to define justice is to identify justice with tradition. To the extent
    that tradition can be identified unambiguously, it is at least a disinterested
    source for justice. Conservatives stress the further virtue of tradition,
    that it has passed the test of evolutionary success. The traditions that
    we have inherited may have hidden strengths that we do not discern and would
    lose if we sought to design our own institutions.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As valid as these claims for tradition are,
    they are not sufficient to make tradition an adequate source for justice.
    In some times and places, tradition has given us slavery, serfdom, denial
    of voting rights to women, and any number of other inequalities that we have
    come to realize we cannot accept. While the Conservative perspective is valuable
    for the insights it provides into rationales for the status quo, its automatic
    acceptance of tradition cannot guarantee the evenhandedness that is essential
    in a theory of justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In rejecting tradition as a fundamental
    source for justice, we must also reject the ultimate authority of laws and
    constitutions as sources for justice. Justice is the standard to which we
    hold laws and constitutions; it is not defined by them. Nevertheless, our
    traditions often embody promises that we have made to one another, which
    we may need to take into account when we decide how we will get from where
    we are to where justice tells us we must be.<span

factories. In Detroit, according to the report of the Michigan Bureau
of Labour Statistics, one half of the children of school age do not
go to school. In New Jersey, the report made to the legislature
discloses an amount of misery and ignorance that is appalling.
Children are growing up there, compelled to monotonous toil when they
ought to be at play, children who do not know how to play; children
who have been so long accustomed to work that they have become used
to it; children growing up in such ignorance that they do not know
what country New Jersey is in, that they never heard of George

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_PJER.html">Peace, Justice
and Economic Reform</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a bumper sticker that
says, "If you want peace, then work
for justice." At a superficial level, this simple slogan contains an
important half-truth. At a deeper level, it contains a more profound
half-truth. To understand these half-truths and why they are only
half true, we need to know what peace is, what justice is, and we
need to understand the relationship between the two. So in this talk
I want to explore the meanings of peace and justice, their
relationship, and the role of economic reform in attaining both.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"If you want peace, then work for
justice." The more obvious and
superficial meaning of this slogan is that people who are treated
unjustly will prevent the attainment of peace until the wrongs to
which they are subject are righted. Demonstrators shout: "No justice.
No peace." The apparent meaning of peace in this case is tranquility,
the absence of strife. And if this meaning of peace is accepted, the
slogan is true. You cannot expect to end strife as long as people
have unresolved grievances. But the reason that this is only half
true is that this meaning is only a shadow of what peace really
is.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is more than armistice, more
than the cessation of violence.
Peace is unity and harmony. In a peaceful world people are all
pleased to cooperate with one another. When we have attained true
peace, there will be no person who has any purpose that any other
person seeks to thwart. In a peaceful world, everyone will feel the
truth of John Donne's meditation,</small></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it imaginable that we might
ever attain a world where everyone
felt so? And if we do so, what will be the role of justice in that
world? What is justice? 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are so many conflicting,
strident claims for different
conceptions of justice that a person might reasonably despair of ever
finding a meaning of justice that people would agree upon. Any
conception of justice may seem to be no more than one person's
opinion. And yet there are things that we all know about justice.<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even the utilitarian proposal
that conflicting claims should be
settled in the way that yields the greatest possible utility must be
rejected as an elitist imposition of a particular goal on people who
may have other plans. If I choose to pursue a life that can be
guaranteed to lead to depression and despair, I have as much claim to
the protection of justice in that pursuit as if I choose the path
that leads to bliss. Justice must be neutral in its evaluation of
people and their goals. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we commit ourselves to
neutrality, does that provide a unique
definition of justice? No, it doesn't. There are a number of
definitions of justice that might claim to satisfy neutrality,
although the claims of some definitions are dubious, and other
definitions can be rejected on other grounds.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider first the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">conservative </span>claim that justice is
defined by
traditional rules.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Next, consider the claim that justice is defined by what the
majority wants. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarian </span>says,
"If you want to know who
should prevail in a conflict, take a vote." As appealing as
majoritarianism may be on the surface, it cannot provide a coherent
theory of justice. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>If voting cannot be used to define justice, one might entertain
the possibility of using a <span style="font-weight: bold;">contractarian
</span>formulation: What is just is
the rules to which people would have agreed if they did not know
their personal circumstances.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a reasonable recipe for
implementing the Golden Rule and a
fine idea for seeking agreement about the principles by which
complaints shall be judged. If people were to follow this suggestion
and achieve the agreement that is described, they would achieve
fairness.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, this does not make
Rawls's suggestion a good way to
identify justice.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, consider <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>. The egalitarian says
that justice
is equality. There is a conceptual difficulty in specifying how
beings as different from each other as humans are could ever be
equal, unless we create a society where all humans are female clones
of one another. (This should be technologically feasible within a few
decades, if it is not already.) But I do not think that egalitarians
want a society of clones. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>John Rawls has proposed
that the talents that individuals possess
be regarded as a common pool, so that anyone who has more than his
share has an obligation to compensate those who have less then their
shares.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></small></small><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All of these suggestions should be
rejected. Talents are not a
common pool from which some persons have taken more then their
shares. If we are all fishing in the same pond, the quantity of fish
that you take will diminish the quantity that is available to me. But
the quantity of talent that you have in no way diminishes the
quantity that is available to me. Your talent is not acquired at my
expense.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the perspective of peace, no
man is an island; each of us is
a part of mankind. And any of us who has been graced with an extra
measure of talent should recognize that, often, the best use of our
talent is to provide for others. Nevertheless, from the perspective
of justice, each of us must be allowed to act like an island if he
wishes. .
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose that a bone-marrow
transplant from me would save your
life--or at least prolong it. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small>If you do not mind requiring a bone-marrow transplant of me,
then
what about a kidney? <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<small>If you do not mind requiring me to donate a kidney, then what
about my heart?&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>A good egalitarian should require me to part with the one
available
heart after I have had my share of years.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I don't think you would. I
don't think anyone would. We are
not egalitarians. We recognize the sanctity of the boundaries of the
human body. In a peaceful world I will gladly give a spare kidney to
anyone who needs it. But in a just world, no one will forcefully
extract a kidney from me, even to save someone else's life. Justice
is not egalitarianism.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Just as I own my kidneys, so do
I own my talents. In a peaceful
world I will use them for the benefit of all mankind. But the sword
of justice should not be used to force me to compensate those with
less talent. Nor should it be used to force me to abide by the
insurance contract that you believe I would have signed, if I had had
the chance, before I knew what talents I would have.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A proper definition of justice
begins with the principles of
classical liberalism. In a just world each person is permitted to
determine the purposes to which his or her body is put--the hands and
the brain no less than the kidneys. We each have rights of
self-determination. This includes the right of ownership of what we
produce, at least, as John Locke said, when we leave as much in
natural opportunities for others as we appropriate for our own
productive activities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[11]</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have the right to co-operate
with whom we choose for whatever
mutually agreed purposes we choose. Thus we have the right to trade
with others, without any artificial hindrances, and we have the right
to keep any wages or interest that we receive from such trading.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the classical
liberal conception of justice
are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
issue of great importance: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">how
are claims of exclusive access to
natural opportunities to be established?
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>John Locke qualified his
statement that we own what we produce
with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
there is plenty of unclaimed land.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span></small>
Locke does not address
the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.
One tradition in classical liberalism concerning claims to land is
that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>"&nbsp;<strong>
...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>," as inspired if not
exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any excess
in one's claim
generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two fundamental
problems with the position of
homesteading libertarians on claims to land.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
with the position of the
homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
allocating land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
thing, as people stampeded to do
whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But the homesteading
libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
because I got here first," isn't justice.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice -- the balancing of the
scales -- is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position,
"I
get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
natural opportunities of equal value for you."&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Justice is thus a regime in which persons have the greatest
possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
reform -- the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
opportunities.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So if you want a peace for others,
then work for justice. Work for
freedom. Work for the elimination of all taxes on the productive
things that people do. Work for equality in the right to benefit from
natural opportunities. All these things will make it easier for
people to make the leap to peace.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But if you want peace for
yourself, simply have it.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<small>VIII. Conclusion</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Humanity is emerging from eons of
development during which
survival has been promoted both by the ability to grab resources from
others and by the ability of groups to cooperate and share natural
resources within communities that occupied territorial homelands. In
recent centuries we have been developing a consensus that taking from
the weak is wrong, and that we ought to have a social order that
prevents all such behavior. But we have not yet worked out how to do
it.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some people
think of preventing grabbing in terms of preserving
the status quo. There are two difficulties with this.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, the status quo incorporates extensive holdings that
were acquired by indefensible means. A decision to preserve the status
quo commits us to defending the indefensible.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, there is no magic to any particular date, before
which unjust appropriations are incorporated into the status quo and
after which they are reversed.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A practice of allowing an
appropriation to be treated as just if
it has survived long enough gives aggressors an incentive to see if
they can grab and hold on long enough. The result is actions like
Indonesia's seizure of East Timor and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Only
if we have a standard of justice that is independent of history can
we expect to end such actions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George's theory of economic
justice--that every person has a
right to his or her productive powers, and that all persons have
equal rights to all natural opportunities--provides a simple formula
around which opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can
coalesce.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This may seem hopelessly
optimistic. But no other theory that I
have seen has anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this
theory.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp; <a

    Injustice: The Locational Benefit Levy</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We all have our own personal
interpretation of how &#8220;justice&#8221; can be
achieved.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Often &#8220;justice&#8221; is interpreted
in a very narrow legal sense and only in
reference to the judicial system, which has been designed to protect
the status quo. ...</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>Of course, all citizens (and subjects in the UK) -- need to know
exactly what are the legal boundaries within which society operates.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But, supposing those original rules are unfair and unjust. Then
the
legal framework, being used to perpetuate an injustice -- does not make
that injustice moral and proper even if within the rules of
jurisprudence it is &#8220;legal.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Obvious examples of this dislocation between immoral laws and
natural
justice is </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>South Africa's former policy of apartheid; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the USA's former
segregated schools and buses; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>discrimination based on race, religion,
disability or sex;

  <li><small>slavery; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the oppression of women; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Victorian
Britain's use of child labour and colonialism. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">All these policies were
&#8220;lawful&#8221; according to the legal framework of their day but that veneer
of legality did not make these policies righteous and just.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>
Any society built on a basis of injustice will be burdened down with
its own predisposition towards self-destruction. Even the most
suppressed people will one-day, demand justice, rise up and overthrow
their oppressors.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Human survival demands justice. Wherever slavery or dictatorship
has
been installed -- eventually, justice has triumphed and a more
democratic and fairer system has replaced it. It is safe to predict
that wherever slavery or dictatorship exists today -- it will be
superseded by a fairer and more just system.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Similarly,
let's consider our distribution of natural resources.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>By definition, natural resources are not made by human effort.
Our
planet offers every inhabitant a bounty -- an amazing treasure chest of
wealth that can supply our needs for food, shelter and every aspect for
our survival.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Surely,
&#8220;justice&#8221; demands that this natural wealth should be equally
available to all and that nobody should starve, be homeless or suffer
poverty simply because they are excluded from tapping in to this
enormous wealth that nature has provided. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
If our whole economy, with the private possession of land and other
natural resources, is built upon an injustice -- then can any of us
really be surprised that we continue to live on a planet where wars
predominate, intolerance is common, crime is rife and where poverty and
starvation is the norm for a huge percentage of earth's population.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Is this inherited system really the best we can do?</small><br>
<br>
<small>There must be a method for fairly utilising the earth's natural
resources.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Referring to the rebuilding of
Iraq in
his recent speech to the American Congress, Tony Blair stated &#8220;We
promised Iraq democratic Government. We will deliver it. We promised
them the chance to use their oil wealth to build prosperity for all
their citizens, not a corrupt elite. We will do so&#8221;.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Thus, Tony Blair recognises the difference between political
justice in
the form of a democratic Government and economic justice in the form of
sharing natural resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We have not heard any dissenting voice from this promise to
share
Iraq's natural oil wealth for all the people of Iraq to enjoy the
benefits. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But if it is so obviously
right and proper for the Iraqi people to share their natural
wealth &#8211; why is it not the practice to do the same in all nations?</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
No landowner can create land values. If this were the case, then an
entrepreurial landowner in the Scottish Highlands would be able to
create more value than an indolent landowner in the City of London.</small><br>
<br>
<small>No, land values arise because of natural advantages (eg
fertility for
agricultural land or approximity to ports or harbours for commercial
sites) or because of the efforts of the whole community -- past and
present investment by both the public and private sectors, and the
activities of individuals all give rise to land values. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why do we not
advocate the sharing of these land values, which are as much a gift of
nature and probably in most western economies are worth much more than
Iraqi oil?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>One solution would be to introduce a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Location
Benefit Levy</span>, where each site is valued, based on its optimum
permitted use and a levy is applied &#8211; a similar method to Britain's
commercial rates on buildings but based soley on the land value and
ignoring the condition of the building.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The outcome of this policy would be to give all citizens a share
in the
natural wealth of the nation. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is an injustice that landowners can speculate on empty sites,
denying their use for jobs or homes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is an injustice that a factory owner can sack all their
workers,
smash the roof of their building to let in the rain and be rewarded
with elimination of their rates bill.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is an injustice that the poorest residents pay the highest
share of
their incomes in Council Tax.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is an injustice that people are denied their share of the
earth's
resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The Location Benefit Levy is a simple way to start addressing
the
world's last great injustice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Q: A former Director of Robert Schalkenbach Foundation was given a grant
      recently to research the adequacy of land as a tax base. He's a professor
      at the University of California, Riverside, named Mason Gaffney, and he
      wrote a book titled, &quot;The Corruption of Economics.&quot; Are you familiar
      with his work?</p>
  <p>JES: No.</p>
  <p>Q: I'll send you a copy of the book. Basically, he argues that the founders
    of neo-classical economics, which, as you know, is the paradigm taught in
    schools such as the University of Chicago, distorted the science of economics
    to protect vested interests. For example, Rockefeller money was spent to
    hire professors of economics with a view to their discrediting the ideas
    of Henry George. Did that happen?</p>
  <p>JES: My general impression is that most donors that give money to universities
    don't take a very strong view of [who should be on] the faculty. Sometimes
    it ends up on one side, sometimes on the other. It would have been unusual
    [at Chicago], but it could have happened there. <strong>What is striking
    about Chicago as a school of economic theory is that it's very conservative.
    One would
    have thought that Henry George was someone who would have been liked by &quot;Conservatives.&quot;</strong></p>
  <p>Q: In that George wanted to reduce tax on the fruits of one's own labor?</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly.<strong> And you want non-distortionary taxes, so I would have
      thought that every &quot;Conservative&quot; would be in Henry George's camp. Now,
    as far as I know, I'm one of the few people who keeps emphasizing that you
    ought to view Henry George in a broader way, to include natural resources.
    </strong>I didn't think that people thought about that a hundred years ago. But if
    they had, and maybe Rockefeller was smart &#8212; he realized that he obviously
    didn't want a tax on natural resources.</p>
  <p>Q: He wouldn't have wanted rents flowing from natural resources to go to
    the people rather than to him.</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, he obviously wouldn't like that perspective. But I don't know
    if that view was at that time recognized, and I just don't know whether he
    actively intervened at Chicago. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

Slope Argument</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
We often hear opposition to a policy proposal because it approaches a
practice that &#8220;down the line&#8221; we find abhorrent, even though there
is nothing particularly offensive about the proposal itself. The
English language is replete with metaphors about practices which, once
started, will evolve beyond the capacity of our own control. We speak,
for example, of chain reactions (here the reference obviously to
nuclear energy), or of things being inexorable or inevitable once
begun. The metaphors are usually mechanistic and from the physical
world, even when discussing political, economic, social or
psychological dynamics.
</small><br>
<br>
<small>Consider some others which you will recognize immediately. We
must be
wary of &#8220;letting the genie out of the bottle,&#8221; or allowing &#8220;the
camel&#8217;s nose under the tent,&#8221; or &#8220;opening Pandora&#8217;s box, &#8220;or &#8220;leading
[anyone] down the garden path.&#8221; So we must &#8220;nip things in the bud,&#8221;
because otherwise we will &#8220;open up the floodgates&#8221; and &#8220;if we give them
an inch, they&#8217;ll take a mile.&#8221; If you can think of others, let me know;
I&#8217;m making a collection of them. </small><br>
<br>
<small>These are known in philosophy as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">wedge arguments</span>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1">2</font></span></small> We&#8217;re
hearing them
more and more, perhaps because public policy
matters are framed by politicians and pundits in sound bite format.
Search &#8220;slippery slope&#8221; on the web and you&#8217;ll come up with hundreds of
hits. The arguments seem, on their face, difficult to answer, even if
we&#8217;re often nonetheless vaguely uncomfortable with them. What I hope to
do here is to explore in an analytic way what in these arguments is
sound and what is fallacious or preposterous. Some recent textbooks in
logic have taken pages to analyze these patterns of thought &#8212; but how
many of us have taken a course in logic recently!&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>There are people who believe that the social world is just as
determined and fated as the world of physics. But for the most part
we live our lives on the daily presumption that we do have choice over
matters and that we make choices as individuals and as a society. We
believe, for the most part, in the free will of people. Few of us are
doctrinaire behaviorists or determinists, and one is hard put to find
many social scientists or philosophers that defend such approaches to
explanation today. The behavioral sciences arose in an era dominated by
assumptions of natural law and later of reductionist positivism, but
philosophy has long since transcended the impasses which provided the
underpinnings of early social science. </small><br>
<br>
<small>It becomes particularly remarkable, therefore, to reflect upon
our
reluctance as a society to confront certain policy matters because
in the minds of some they would &#8220;open the doors&#8221; to other ethical
choices down the line. We do indeed have choices, both as individuals
and as corporate institutions. Yet rather than openly confront each
dilemma incrementally as mature and responsible adults, many would
close such matters from discussion entirely because it would &#8220;lead us
down the garden path&#8221; to some forbidden or dangerous realm or other.</small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Creeping
Socialism</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider some instances where
the specter of the slippery slope has
often been invoked. We all are old enough to remember &#8220;creeping
socialism,&#8221; the conservative bugaboo which we thought died after
Goldwater invoked it to damn Johnson&#8217;s Great Society programs.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>There was a time in this country&#8217;s history when the general
public was
largely incapable
of distinguishing socialism from communism. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Fears of creeping socialism were revived during and after World
War
II, leading to McCarthyism and destroying the lives and reputations
of many artists, writers and other public figures, particularly in
Hollywood. Certain organizations had a vested interest in maintaining
confusion between the free-market social welfare state and
state-communism. Hence, whenever programs of a social welfare nature
were proposed &#8212; even to address those elements of an economy understood
as &#8220;public goods&#8221; and &#8220;natural monopolies,&#8221; the specter was raised that
a coterie of treacherous plotters sought to transform the &#8220;American way
of life!&#8221; Adlai Stevenson&#8217;s comment summed up much of the final days of
this era with his comment that &#8220;There&#8217;s something else I dislike just
as much as creeping socialism, and that&#8217;s galloping reaction.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> I
thought the phrase had disappeared from the American lexicon, but a
search on the web site turned up several recent articles and news
releases, one from the Conservative News Service in Washington just
this past March. According to that article, &#8220;The greatest threat facing
the planet
today is not AIDS, overpopulation or global warming but creeping
socialism, according to a group of conservative women gathered in
Washington, D.C. this week for an international conference.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small>
Democratic governor Jim Hunt of North Carolina had his health care
proposals met with the editorial comment that "It&#8217;s time to call a halt
to the creeping socialism that threatens to destroy this nation one
program at a time. If the goal is to provide health care for children,
there are any number of ways to achieve that desirable end other than
implementation of yet another income redistribution scheme.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5 </span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>It appears that with the demise of the &#8220;cold war,&#8221; American
politics is
struggling to rediscover its philosophical moorings; conservatives,
no longer able to invoke communism as a bugaboo, are reaching back to a
pre-industrial era of laissez faire capitalism and the nightwatchman
state.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a difference, too, between explaining things
historically
and attributing unilinear causality to social events. As it
happens, if our views of human nature and of social institutions are
colored by pessimism and if we believe that we human beings are by
nature self serving and rapacious, we are likely to have one view of
matters. If, on the other hand, our view of human beings, both
collectively and individually, is more optimistic and altruistic, our
conclusions will reflect this too.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This has been borne out in several studies of personality and
politics
over the years. People with a dim view of human nature are more likely
to see conspiracies and negative consequences to what is often
perceived as social
engineering. And people more trusting of others and of
institutional authority are less likely to be concerned about the
negative consequences of policy proposals.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> In </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">recent
years, those wearing the popular
appellation of &#8220;conservative&#8221; &#8212; at least in the American sense of the
term &#8212; are more distrustful of others, of government, and of
institutions generally. There is a further corollary to this as well:
that people who believe that human nature is inherently selfish will
tend to believe that their own selfish behavior is only natural, and
they will attribute the same low motives to others that they use to
justify their own behavior.
</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This further reinforces their own view that they are completely
justified in acting in the way that they do. Realizing that this is
the mentality that drives such people, those who take a more benign
view of human nature and of political institutions are then compelled
to find the motives of their opposites suspect and threatening.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17</span></small> So
such escalating distrust becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.</small><br>
<small>&nbsp; </small><br>
<small>I would like to illustrate the dynamics ofthis thinking through
one
widely used psychological scale, used in countless studies over the
course of
some 40 years. It is known as the &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Faith
in People
Scale</span>,&#8221; originally developed in 1956 by Rosenberg.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">18</span></small> One
point is awarded for each scaled response. A score of five identifies
you as having a very low level of trust in others. I will read the five
paired statements to you, since they are very short: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="-1">1. Some people say that
      most
people
can be trusted. Others say you can&#8217;t be too careful in your
dealings with people. How do you feel about it?</font></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><font size="-1"><small>&#8226; Most people can be trusted.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; You
    can&#8217;t
be too careful.</small></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><font size="-1"><small>2. Would you say that most
people are
more inclined to help others, or more inclined to look out for
themselves?</small></font></div>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><font size="-1"><small>&#8226; To help others. &#8226; To
look out for themselves.</small></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><font size="-1"><small>3. If you don&#8217;t
      watch yourself,
people will take advantage of you.</small></font></div>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><font size="-1"><small>Agree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disagree</small></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><font size="-1"><small>4. No one is going to care much
what
happens to you, when you get right down to it.</small></font></div>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><font size="-1"><small>Agree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disagree</small></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><font size="-1"><small>5. Human nature is fundamentally
cooperative.</small></font></div>
<p style="margin-left: 120px;"><font size="-1"><small>Agree &nbsp; &nbsp; Disagree</small></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So that&#8217;s what it may come down
to, not to a matter of validity of
the slippery slope argument as measured in logical terms, but
rather by the extent to which social decisions are made by people who
can be trusted and relied
upon to act in altruistic ways. If people expect the worst, the
worst may happen. If people look on the positive side, that trust may
engender further such feelings and be self-reinforcing.&#8220;What goes
around comes around,&#8221; as they say, applied to both conservatives with a
dim view of human nature and society as well as to progressives with
their more hopeful view. </small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a further dimension to all this which offers a
fascinating
area for study. The faith-in-people scale along with many other
research instruments has been used in many societies and at various
times. But time has been too short in this
country for us to be able to say very much about what has happened over
the past 250 years with respect to public sentiments. The general view
is that people have become more cynical and pessimistic; what this
portends for America&#8217;s future, and particularly the future of our
political health, is well worth pondering. </small><br>
<br>
<small>We used to be a nation of optimists, at least as other nations
saw us.
That may have been our greatest asset. If we lose this optimism, we
may be the worse for it as a nation. And to this extent, our declining
view of
ourselves and our motives may be the ultimate slippery slope.... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>The proverb &quot;There is nothing sure but Death and Taxes,&quot; is at
    once a recognition of the tendency to change in all human affairs, and a
    triumphant
      assertion of Conservatism that there remain at least two immutable things.</p>
  <p>But the tooth of time which respects no mortal institution is boldly at
    work on even this proverb and threatens to remove Taxes from the meagre list
    of
      things permanent. It is the purpose of this booklet to give some account
    of this startling phenomenon. With this in view let us lay down and briefly
    defend
      the proposition that &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>          <em>Taxation as a means of meeting the proper expenses of government
        is oppressive, unjust, inexpedient and unnecessary. </em>... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

  and Spending Decisions</a></small></small><a href="../docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Two of the most troublesome features of taxation and public spending are that
    taxation relies on coercion, and that the combination of taxing and public
    spending generates substantially haphazard redistribution. People must pay
    their taxes on penalty of having their property confiscated, or of going to
    jail. And we cannot
  say that this process is for everyone's good.</p>
  <p>There is reason to believe, though we do not have the basis to say for sure,
    that some people receive much less in benefits from public spending than they
    pay in taxes. How do we justify the harm that is thereby done to some persons
    by the combination of taxing and public spending? I would like to address this
    question by first discussing some possible justifications that might seem attractive,
    but should be rejected.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One possible justification is <span style="font-weight: bold;">conservatism</span>:
        Things have always been done this way. Our institutions have evolved to solve
        social problems that we may not even be aware of. Who knows what terrible
        things might happen if we did things differently?
          <p>There is an element of validity to the conservative position, but
            not an adequate basis for making conservatism the primary principle
            of social
            organization. If we had adopted conservatism as the primary principle
            of social organization centuries ago, there would have been no end
            to slavery, no women's suffrage, nor any of the numerous other changes
            in
            social organization in response to improvements in our moral understanding.
            It would be foolhardy to assert that we will never experience further
            improvements in our moral understanding that will call for changes
            in social organization. ... <a href="../docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read the whole article</a></p>
