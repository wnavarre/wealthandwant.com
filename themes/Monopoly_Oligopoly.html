  <p>THE term Labor includes all human exertion in the production of wealth,
    whatever its mode. In common parlance we often speak of brain labor and hand
    labor as though they were entirely distinct kinds of exertion, and labor
    is often spoken of as though it involved only muscular exertion. But in reality
    any form of labor, that is to say, any form of human exertion in the production
    of wealth above that which cattle may be applied to doing, requires the human
    brain as truly as the human hand, and would be impossible without the exercise
    of mental faculties on the part of the laborer. Labor in fact is only physical
    in external form. In its origin it is mental or on strict analysis spiritual. &#8212; <em>The

IT seems to us that your Holiness misses its real significance in intimating
that Christ in becoming the son of a carpenter and Himself working as a carpenter
showed merely that "there is nothing to be ashamed of in seeking one's bread
by labor." To say that is almost like saying that by not robbing people He showed
that there is nothing to be ashamed of in honesty. If you will consider how true
in any large view is the classification of all men into working-men, beggar-men
and thieves, you will see that it was morally impossible that Christ during His
stay on earth should have been anything else than a working-man, since He who
came to fulfill the law must by deed as well as word obey God's law of labor.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
See how fully and how beautifully Christ's life on earth illustrated this law.
Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as it is appointed that
all should enter it, He lovingly took what in the natural order is lovingly rendered,
the sustenance, secured by labor, that one generation owes to its immediate successors.
Arrived at maturity, He earned His own subsistence by that common labor in which
the majority of men must and do earn it. Then passing to a higher &#8212; to
the very highest-sphere of labor. He earned His subsistence by the teaching of
moral and spiritual truths, receiving its material wages in the love offerings
of grateful hearers, and not refusing the costly spikenard with which Mary anointed
his feet. So, when He chose His disciples, He did not go to land-owners or other
monopolists who live on the labor of others but to common laboring men. And when
He called them to a higher sphere of labor and sent them out to teach moral and
spiritual truths He told them to take, without condescension on the one hand,
or sense of degradation on the other, the loving return for such labor, saying
to them that the "laborer is worthy of his hire," thus showing, what we hold,
that all labor does not consist in what is called manual labor, but that whoever
helps to add to the material, intellectual, moral, or spiritual fulness of life
is also a laborer. - <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
of Labor</a><br>
<br>
NOR should it be forgotten that the investigator, the philosopher, the teacher,
the artist, the poet, the priest, though not engaged in the production of wealth,
are not only engaged in the production of utilities and satisfactions to which
the production of wealth is only a means, but by acquiring and diffusing knowledge,
stimulating mental powers and elevating the moral sense, may greatly increase
the ability to produce wealth. For man does not live by bread alone. He is not
an engine, in which so much fuel gives so much power. On a capstan bar or a topsail
halyard a good song tells like muscle, and a "Marseillaise" or a "Battle Hymn
of the Republic" counts for bayonets. A hearty laugh, a noble thought, a perception
of harmony, may add to the power of dealing even with material things. <br>
<br>
He who by any exertion of mind or body adds to the aggregate of enjoyable wealth,
increases the sum of human knowledge or gives to human life higher elevation
or greater fulness &#8212; he is, in the large meaning of the words, a "producer," a "working-man," a "laborer," and
is honestly earning honest wages. But he who without doing aught to make mankind
richer, wiser, better, happier, lives on the toil of others &#8212; he, no matter
by what name of honor he may be I called, or how lustily the priests of Mammon
may swing their censers before him, is in the last analysis but a beggarman or
a thief. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, Chapter 7 <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT7.html#Chapter%207">econlib</a></p>
  <p>THE primary purpose and end of government being to secure the natural rights
    and equal liberty of each, all businesses that involve monopoly are within
    the necessary province of governmental regulation, and businesses that are
    in their nature complete monopolies become properly functions of the State.
    As society develops, the State must assume these functions, in their nature
    co-operative, in order to secure the equal rights and liberty of all. That
    is to say, as, in the process of integration, the individual becomes more
    and more dependent upon and subordinate to the all, it becomes necessary
    for government, which is properly that social organ by which alone the whole
    body of individuals can act, to take upon itself, in the interest of all,
    certain functions which cannot safely be left to individuals. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp17.html">Social

            </em><br>
IT is not the business of government to make men virtuous or religious, or to
preserve the fool from the consequences of his own folly. Government should be
repressive no further than is necessary to secure liberty by protecting the equal
rights of each from aggression on the part of others, and the moment governmental
prohibitions extend beyond this line they are in danger of defeating the very
ends they are intended to serve.&#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp17.html">Social

ALL schemes for securing equality in the conditions of men by placing the distribution
of wealth in the hands of government have the fatal defect of beginning at the
wrong end. They pre-suppose pure government; but it is not government that makes
society; it is society that makes government; and until there is something like
substantial equality in the distribution of wealth, we cannot expect pure government. &#8212; <em>Protection

            THE poverty to which in advancing civilization great masses of men
            are condemned, is not the freedom from distraction and temptation
            which
  sages have sought and philosophers have praised: it is a degrading and
  embruting slavery, that cramps the higher nature, dulls the finer
  feelings, and drives men by its pain to acts which the brutes would
  refuse. It is into this helpless, hopeless poverty, that crushes
  manhood and destroys womanhood, that robs even childhood of its
  innocence and joy, that the working classes are being driven by a force
  which acts upon them like a resistless and unpitying machine. The
  Boston collar manufacturer who pays his girls two cents an hour may
  commiserate their condition, but he, as they, is governed by the law of
  competition, and cannot pay more and carry on his business, for exchange
  is not governed by sentiment. And so, through all intermediate
  gradations, up to those who receive the earnings of labor without
  return, in the rent of land, it is the inexorable laws of supply and
  demand, a power with which the individual can no more quarrel or
  dispute than with the winds and the tides, that seem to press down the
  lower classes into the slavery of want. <br>
  <br>
But, in reality, the cause is that which always has, and always must result in
slavery &#8212; the monopolization by some of what nature has designed for all.
. . . Private ownership of land is the nether millstone. Material progress is
the upper millstone. Between them; with an increasing pressure, the working classes
are being ground. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp072.html">Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212;</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp072.html"> Book

  <p> IT is not in the relations of capital and labor; it is not in the pressure
    of population against subsistence that an explanation of the unequal development
    of our civilization is to be found. The great cause of inequality in the
    distribution of wealth is inequality in the ownership of land. The ownership
    of land is the great fundamental fact which ultimately determines the social,
    the political and, consequently, the intellectual and moral condition of
    a people. And it must be so. For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse
    upon which he must draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor
    must be applied for the supply of all his desires; for even the products
    of the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces
    of nature utilized, without the use of land or its products. On the land
    we are born, from it we live, to it we return again &#8212; children of the
    soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower of the field. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html"> &#8212; Book

    wealth</a><br>
      <br>
  THERE is nothing strange or inexplicable in the phenomena that are now perplexing
  the world. It is not that material progress is not in itself a good, it is
  not that nature has called into being children for whom she has failed to provide;
  it is not that the Creator has left on natural laws a taint of injustice at
  which even the human mind revolts, that material progress brings such bitter
  fruits. That amid our highest civilization men faint and die with want is not
  due to the niggardliness of nature, but to the injustice of man. Vice and misery,
  poverty and pauperism, are not the legitimate results of increase of population
  and industrial development; they only follow increase of population and industrial
  development because land is treated as private property &#8212; they are the
  direct and necessary results of the violation of the supreme law of justice,
  involved in giving to some men the exclusive possession of that which nature
  provides for all men. &#8212;<em> <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span> LABOR may be likened to a man who as he carries home his earnings is
  waylaid by a series of robbers. One demands this much, and another that much,
  but last of all stands one who demands all that is left, save just enough to
  enable the victim to maintain life and come forth next day to work. So long
  as this last robber remains, what will it benefit such a man to drive off any
  or all of the other robbers? <br>
    <br>
Such is the situation of labor today throughout the civilized world. And the
robber that takes all that is left, is private property in land. Improvement,
no matter how great, and reform, no matter how beneficial in itself, cannot help
that class who, deprived of all right to the use of the material elements, have
only the power to labor &#8212; a power as useless in itself as a sail without
wind, a pump without water, or a saddle without a horse. &#8212; <em>Protection

THERE is but one way to remove an evil &#8212; and that is, to remove its cause.
Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>while
productive power grows, because land, which is the source of all wealth and the
field of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate poverty, to make wages what
justice commands they should be, the full earnings of the laborer, we must therefore
substitute for the individual ownership of land a common ownership. Nothing else
will go to the cause of the evil &#8212; in nothing else is there the slightest

So,  too, as we see in Congress, and even in our State legislatures, the  growth of the country and the greater number of interests make the  proportion of the votes of a representative, of which his constituents  know or care to know, less and less.

  <p>Indirect taxation costs the real tax-payers much more than the government
    receives, partly because the middlemen through whose hands taxed commodities
    pass are able to exact compound profits upon the tax,8 and partly on account
    of extraordinary expenses of original collection;9 it favors corruption in
    government by concealing from the people the fact that they contribute to
    the support of government; and it tends, by obstructing production, to crush
    legitimate industry and establish monopolies.10 The questions it raises are
    of vastly more
concern than is indicated by the sum total of public expenditures.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance by shoe
        manufacturers, enters into manufacturers' prices, and, together with
        the usual rate of profit upon that amount of investment, is recovered
        from wholesalers. The tax and the manufacturers' profit upon it then
        constitute part of the wholesale price and are collected from retailers.
        The retailers in turn collect the tax with all intermediate profits upon
        it, together with their usual rate of profit upon the whole, from final
        purchasers &#8212; the consumers of shoes. Thus what appears on the surface
        to be a tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination to be an
        indirect tax upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation of profits
        upon the tax considerably more than the government receives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The effect would be the same if a tax upon their leather
        output were imposed upon tanners. Tanners would add to the price of leather
        the amount of the tax, plus their usual rate of profit upon a like investment,
        and collect the whole, together with the cost of hides, of transportation,
        of tanning and of selling, from shoe manufacturers, who would collect
        with their profit from retailers, who would collect with their profit
        from shoe consumers. The principle applies also when taxes are levied
        upon the stock or the sales of merchants, or the money or credits of
        bankers; merchants add the tax with the usual profit to the prices of
        their goods, and bankers add it to their interest and discounts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output of manufacturers
        or importers would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing profit, cost
        wholesalers $110,000; at a profit of 10 per cent to wholesalers it would
        cost retailers $121,000, and at 20 percent profit to retailers it would
        finally impose a tax burden of $145,200 &#8212; being 45 per cent more
        than the government would get. Upon most commodities the number of profits
        exceeds three, so that indirect taxes may frequently cost as much as
        100 per cent, even when imposed only upon what are commercially known
        as finished goods; when imposed upon materials also, the cost of collection
        might well run far above 200 percent in addition to the first cost of
        maintaining the machinery of taxation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery of
        indirect taxes from the ultimate consumers of taxed goods is arbitrary.
        When shoe manufacturers, or tanners, or merchants add taxes to prices,
        or bankers add them to interest, it is not because they might do otherwise
        but choose to do this; it is because the exigencies of trade compel them.
        Manufacturers, merchants, and other tradesmen who carry on competitive
        businesses must on the average sell their goods at cost plus the ordinary
        rate of profit, or go out of business. It follows that any increase in
        cost of production tends to increase the price of products. Now, a tax
        upon the output of business men, which they must pay as a condition of
        doing their business, is as truly part of the cost of their output as
        is the price of the materials they buy or the wages of the men they hire.
        Therefore, such a tax upon business men tends to increase the price of
        their products. And this tendency is more or less marked as the tax is
        more or less great and competition more or less keen.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It is true that a moderate tax upon <strong>monopolized</strong> products,
        such as trade-mark goods, proprietary medicines, patented articles and
        copyright publications is not necessarily shifted to consumers. The monopoly
        manufacturer whose prices are not checked by cost of production, and
        are therefore as a rule higher than competitive prices would be, may
        find it more profitable to bear the burden of a tax that leaves him some
        profit, by preserving his entire custom, than to drive off part of his
        custom by adding the tax to his usual prices. This is true also of a
        moderate import tax to the extent it falls upon goods that are more cheaply
        transported from the place of production to a foreign market where the
        import tax is imposed than to a home market where the goods would be
        free of such a tax &#8212; products, for instance, of a farm in Canada
        near to a New York town, but far away from any Canadian town. If the
        tax be less than the difference in the cost of transportation the producer
        will bear the burden of it; otherwise he will not. The ultimate effect
        would be a reduction in the value of the Canadian land. Examples which
        may be cited in opposition to the principle that import taxes are indirect,
        will upon examination prove to be of the character here described. Business
        cannot be carried on at a loss &#8212; not for long. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>Whoever calmly reflects and candidly decides upon the merits of indirect
    taxation must reject it in all its forms. But to do that is to make a great
    stride toward accepting the single tax. For the single tax is a form of direct
    taxation; it cannot be shifted.11</p>
  <p><em>Q31. Will not the capitalist be able under the single tax to undersell
      the laborer &#8212; to sell goods for less than cost, at least temporarily &#8212; and
      thereby force him to accept the capitalist's terms?</em><br>
A. With capitalists continually hunting for men to help them fill their orders,
and bidding against each other to get men, as would be the case under the single
tax, such a contingency would be in the highest degree improbable. It is practically
impossible. Nothing short of a trust, an absolutely perfect trust, of all the
owners of capital the world over could produce it. And even then, plenty of very
useful land of all kinds being free and labor products being exempt from taxation,
all people who were outside of the trust would resort co-operatively to the land,
and the trust would be obliged to take them in as the alternative of falling
to pieces under their competition.</p>
  <p><em>Q34. Would the single tax benefit the debtor class? If so, how?</em><br>
A. It would. By abolishing the monopoly of opportunities to work, and thus enabling
  debtors to earn enough, while decently supporting themselves, to honestly pay
  their debts. The debtor class deserves sympathy, not because it is in debt,
  but because it is forced by existing institutions to go into debt in order
  to work, and is then so hampered and harried by the same institutions as to
  make orderly repayment impossible and bankruptcy inevitable.</p>
  <p><em>Q35. What would be the effect of the single tax if you still left railroad,
    telegraph, money, and other monopolies in private hands?</em><br>
    A. The real strength of all monopolies is in land monopoly. Observe, for
    example, the land holdings of the inside ring of such railroads as the Southern
    Pacific, to which the interests of the road are corruptly made subordinate.
    Abolish land monopoly, and the power of all the others will go, as Sampson's
    strength went with the cutting of his hair. </p>
  <p><em>Q49. Would the single tax abolish interest?</em><br>
A. I do not think so. Interest properly understood is a form of wages, and so
  far from abolishing it, the single tax, which would tend to increase all forms
  of wages, would tend to increase interest. But monopoly profits are often confounded
  with interest, and by force of association have given to interest a bad name;
  these would be minimized if not wholly abolished by the single tax. It is impossible
  to answer this question intelligibly to everyone who asks it, without requiring
  him to be specific; for it is seldom that two persons agree as to what they
  mean by interest. The Western farmer thinks of the high rate that he pays,
  partly for risk, partly from his ignorance of the modus operandi of banking,
  and partly because legitimate banking facilities are scarce in his Community;
  the Wall Street operator thinks of the premiums that he pays for currency in
  times of stress to tide him over from day to day; others think of &quot;interest&quot; on
  government bonds, and others of dividends of companies with valuable land rights.
  None of these payments are really interest, and the single tax would tend to
  rid society of them. But that advantage which the workmen enjoy whose implements
  and materials are already gathered, over those who have yet to devote time
  to gathering implements and materials, an advantage which is expressed in money
  and as interest upon capital, will not, I should think, be abolished by anything
  that man can do. The value of such an advantage is part of the wages of the
  labor that creates it. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

  <p><em>Q29. How does privilege affect the distribution of wealth?</em><br>
    A. Wealth as produced is now distributed substantially in but two channels,
      privilege and wages. The abolition of privilege would leave but the one
      proper channel, viz., wages of capital, hand, and brain.</p>
  <p><em>Q30. How would the single tax increase wages?</em><br>
A. By gradually transferring to wages that portion of the current wealth that
  now flows to privilege. In other words, it would widen and deepen the channel
  of wages by enlarging opportunities for labor, and by increasing the purchasing
  power of nominal wages through reduction of prices. On the other hand it would
  narrow the channel of privilege by making the man who has a privilege pay for
  it.</p>
  <p><em>Q31. How can this transfer be effected?</em><br>
  A. By the taxation of privilege.</p>
  <p><em>Q32. How much ultimately may wages be thus increased?</em><br>
  A. Fifty percent would be a low estimate.</p>
  <p><em>Q33. What are fair prices and fair wages?</em><br>
  A. Prices unenhanced by privilege, and wages undiminished by taxation.</p>

  <p>&#8220;Christ knew better than we that 'No man having put his hand to the
    plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God;' nor is any man doing
    his duty who shrinks and is faithless to his fellow-men. Now a word more
    about Abolitionists and new ideas in Government, whatever they may be: We
    are all called Abolitionists now who desire any restriction of slavery or
    believe that the system is wrong, as I have declared for years. We are called
    so, not to help out a peaceful solution, but in derision, to abase us, and
    enable the defamers to make successful combinations against us. I never was
    much annoyed by these, less now than ever. I favor the best plan to restrict
    the extension of slavery peacefully, and fully believe that we must reach
    some plan that will do it, and provide for some method of final extinction
    of the evil, before we can have permanent peace on the subject. On other
    questions there is ample room for reform when the time comes; but now it
    would be folly to think that we could undertake more than we have on hand.<strong> But
    when slavery is over with and settled, men should never rest content while
    oppressions, wrongs, and iniquities are in force against them.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&#8220;The land, the earth that God gave to man for his home, his
      sustenance, and support, should never be the possession of any man, corporation,
      society, or unfriendly Government, any more than the air or the water,
      if as much. An individual company or enterprise requiring land should hold
      no more in their own right than is needed for their home and sustenance,
      and never more than they have in actual use in the prudent management of
      their legitimate business, and this much should not be permitted when it
      creates an exclusive monopoly. All that is not so used should be held for
      the free use of every family to make homesteads, and to hold them as long
      as they are so occupied.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&#8220;A reform like this will be worked out some time in the future.
      The idle talk of foolish men, that is so common now, on 'Abolitionists,
      agitators, and disturbers of the peace,' will find its way against it,
      with whatever force it may possess, and as strongly promoted and carried
      on as it can be by land monopolists, grasping landlords, and the titled

      Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
      14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
      X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
      is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
      of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
      and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
      the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
  <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils arising
      from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are becoming more
      and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents of progress,
      but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they will not cure
      themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
      greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
      previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that these evils are not
      imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
      which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
      an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
  <p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men, and
      all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
      <strong>In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature
      freely offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice &#8212; for, so far
      as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems to be
      the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and asserting
      the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform ourselves
      to the law </strong>&#8212; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution
          of wealth and power; </li>
    <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
    <li>tame the ruthless passions of greed; </li>
    <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
    <li>light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; </li>
    <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse to discovery; </li>
    <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
    <li>make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men
      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
      inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
      by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political rights
      will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of nature.
      Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes, as population
      increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment
      at starvation wages.</strong> This is the truth that we have ignored. And so</p>
  <ul>
    <li> there come beggars in our streets and tramps on our roads; and</li>
    <li> poverty enslaves men who we boast are political sovereigns; and</li>
    <li> want breeds ignorance that our schools cannot enlighten; and</li>
    <li> citizens vote as their masters dictate; and</li>
    <li> the demagogue usurps the part of the statesman; and</li>
    <li> gold weighs in the scales of justice; and</li>
    <li> in high places sit those who do not pay to civic virtue even the compliment
          of hypocrisy; and</li>
    <li> the pillars of the republic that we thought so strong already bend under
          an increasing strain.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her statues and sound her
      praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so grow her
      demands. She will have no half service!</p>
  <p>Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings.
      For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the law
      of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation.</p>
  <p>They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission when she has
      abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot, who think of
    her as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of life, have
    not seen
      her real grandeur &#8212; to them the poets who have sung of her must seem
      rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun is the lord of life, as
      well as of light; as his beams not merely pierce the clouds, but support
      all growth,
      supply all motion, and call forth from what would otherwise be a cold and
      inert mass all the infinite diversities of being and beauty, so is liberty
      to mankind.
      It is not for an abstraction that men have toiled and died; that in every
      age the witnesses of Liberty have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty
      have
      suffered.</p>
  <p>We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge, invention,
      national strength, and national independence as other things. But, of all these,
      Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary condition. ...</p>
  <p>Only in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet beamed
      among men, but all progress hath she called forth. ...</p>
  <p>Shall we not trust her?</p>
  <p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
      inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower. Liberty
      calls to us again. We must follow her further; we must trust her fully. Either
      we must wholly accept her or she will not stay. <strong>It is not enough that
      men should vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before
      the law.
      They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means of
      life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature.
      Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light! </strong>Either this, or darkness comes
      on, and the very forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that work
      destruction. This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries.
      Unless its foundations be laid in justice the social structure cannot stand.</p>
  <p><strong>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing
        one man to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have
        made them
      his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on. </strong>This
      is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
      the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
      is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has
      been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom,
      and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
  <p><strong>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse.</strong> It
      is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
      houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
      them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
      that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
  <p><strong>Civilization so based cannot continue.</strong> The eternal laws
    of the universe forbid it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness
    that is in every soul answers,
      that it cannot be. It is something grander than Benevolence, something
    more august than Charity &#8212; it is Justice herself that demands of us to right
      this wrong. Justice that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice
      that with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies
      and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches
      when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep?</p>
  <p><strong>Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that attributes
        to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and brutishness that
        come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the All-Father and lays
        on Him the responsibility for the want and crime of our great cities. </strong>We
        degrade the Everlasting. We slander the Just One. A merciful man would
        have better ordered the world; a just man would crush with his foot such
        an ulcerous
        ant-hill! It is not the Almighty, but we who are responsible for the
        vice and misery that fester amid our civilization. The Creator showers
        upon us
        his gifts &#8212; more than enough for all. But like swine scrambling for
        food, we tread them in the mire &#8212; tread them in the mire, while
        we tear and rend each other!</p>
  <p><strong>In the very centers of our civilization today are want and suffering
        enough to make sick at heart whoever does not close his eyes and steel his
        nerves. Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to relieve it?</strong> Supposing
        the prayer were heard, and at the behest with which the universe sprang into
        being there should glow in the sun a greater power; new virtue fill the air;
        fresh vigor the soil; that for every blade of grass that now grows two should
        spring up, and the seed that now increases fiftyfold should increase a hundredfold!
        Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever benefit
        would accrue would be but temporary. The new powers streaming through the
        material universe could be utilized only through land.</p>
  <p>This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a fact of experience. <strong>We
        know it because we have seen it. </strong>Within our own times, under our
        very eyes, that Power which is above all, and in all, and through all; that
        Power of which the whole universe is but the manifestation; that Power which
        maketh all things, and without which is not anything made that is made, has
        increased the bounty which men may enjoy, as truly as though the fertility
        of nature had been increased. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Into the mind of one came the thought that harnessed steam for the service
          of mankind. </li>
    <li>To the inner ear of another was whispered the secret that compels the
      lightning to bear a message round the globe. </li>
    <li>In every direction have the laws of matter been revealed; </li>
    <li>in every department of industry have arisen arms of iron and fingers
      of steel, whose effect upon the production of wealth has been precisely
      the
          same as an increase in the fertility of nature. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What has been the result? Simply that landowners get all the gain.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Can it be that the gifts of the Creator may be thus misappropriated
        with impunity? Is it a light thing that labor should be robbed of its earnings
        while greed rolls in wealth &#8212; that the many should want while the few
        are surfeited? </strong>Turn to history, and on every page may be read
        the lesson that such wrong never goes unpunished; that the Nemesis that
        follows
        injustice never falters nor sleeps! Look around today. Can this state
        of things continue? May we even say, &quot;After us the deluge!&quot; Nay;
        the pillars of the State are trembling even now, and the very foundations
        of
        society begin to quiver with pent-up forces that glow underneath. The
        struggle that must either revivify, or convulse in ruin, is near at hand,
        if it be
        not already begun.</p>
  <p>The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers born
      of progress, forces have entered the world that will either compel us to a
      higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as civilization after
      civilization, have been overwhelmed before. ... </p>
  <ul>
    <li> We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and then
          refusing them the right to earn an honest living.</li>
    <li> We cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then denying
          the inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even now, in old bottles the new wine begins to ferment, and elemental forces
      gather for the strife!</p>
  <p><strong>But if, while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey her,
        if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now threaten must disappear,<em> the
        forces that now menace will turn to agencies of elevation.</em> </strong>Think
        of the powers now wasted; of the infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored;
        of the possibilities of which the wondrous inventions of this century give
        us but a hint.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> With want destroyed;</li>
    <li> with greed changed to noble passions;</li>
    <li> with the fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the
      jealousy and fear that now array men against each other;</li>
    <li> with mental power loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort
          and leisure; and</li>
    <li> who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Words fail the thought! <strong>It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung
        and high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious vision which

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> One cannot look, it seems to
me, through nature &#8212; whether
one looks at the stars through a telescope, or have the microscope
reveal to one those worlds that we find in drops of water. Whether
one considers the human frame, the adjustments of the animal kingdom,
or any department of physical nature, one must see that there has
been a contriver and adjuster, that there has been an intent. So
strong is that feeling, so natural is it to our minds, that even
people who deny the Creative Intelligence are forced, in spite of
themselves, to talk of intent; the claws on one animal were intended,
we say, to climb with, the fins of another to propel it through the
water. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Yet, while in looking through the
laws of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical </span>nature, we
find intelligence we do not so clearly find beneficence. But in the
great <span style="font-style: italic;">social </span>fact that as
population increases, and improvements are
made, and men progress in civilisation, the one thing that rises
everywhere in value is land, and in this we may see a proof of the
beneficence of the Creator. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider what it means! It
means that the social laws are
adapted to progressive humanity! In a rude state of society where
there is no need for common expenditure, there is no value attaching
to land. The only value which attaches there is to things produced by
labour. But as civilisation goes on, as a division of labour takes
place, as people come into centres, so do the common wants increase,
and so does the necessity for public revenue arise. And so in that
value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the
individual does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a
provision intended &#8212; we may safely say intended &#8212; to meet
that social want. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Just as society grows, so do the common needs grow, and so grows
this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided fund from which they
can be supplied. Here is a value that may be taken, without impairing
the right of property, without taking anything from the producer,
without lessening the natural rewards of industry and thrift. Nay,
here is a value that must be taken if we would prevent the most
monstrous of all monopolies. What does all this mean? It means that
in the creative plan, the natural advance in civilisation is an
advance to a greater and greater equality instead of to a more and
more monstrous inequality.&nbsp; </span></small><small>... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
Now, think of it &#8212; is not land monopolisation a sufficient reason for
poverty? What is man? In the first place, he is an animal, a land
animal who cannot live without land. All that man produces comes from
land; all productive labour, in the final analysis, consists in working
up land; or materials drawn from land, into such forms as fit them for
the satisfaction of human wants and desires. Why, man's very body is
drawn from the land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Children of the
soil, we come from the land, and to the land we must return. Take away
from man all that belongs to the land, and what have you but a
disembodied spirit? Therefore he who holds the land on which and from
which another man must live, is that man's master; and the man is his
slave. </span>The man who holds the land on which I must live can
command me to life or to death just as absolutely as though I were his
chattel. Talk about abolishing slavery &#8212; we have not abolished slavery;
we have only abolished one rude form of it, chattel slavery. There is a
deeper and a more insidious form, a more cursed form yet before us to
abolish, in this industrial slavery that makes a man a virtual slave,
while taunting him and mocking him with the name of freedom. Poverty!
want! they will sting as much as the lash. Slavery! God knows there are
horrors enough in slavery; but there are deeper horrors in our
civilised society today. Bad as chattel slavery was, it did not drive
slave mothers to kill their children, yet you may read in official
reports that the system of child insurance which has taken root so
strongly in England, and which is now spreading over our Eastern
States, has perceptibly and largely increased the rate of child
mortality! &#8212; What does that mean?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Robinson Crusoe, as you know,
when he rescued Friday from the
cannibals, made him his slave. Friday had to serve Crusoe. But,
supposing Crusoe had said, "O man and brother, I am very glad to
see you, and I welcome you to this island, and you shall be a free
and independent citizen, with just as much to say as I have except
that this island is mine, and of course, as I can do as I please with
my own property, you must not use it save upon my terms." Friday
would have been just as much Crusoe's slave as though he had called
him one. Friday was not a fish, he could not swim off through the
sea; he was not a bird, and could not fly off through the air; if he
lived at all, he had to live on that island. And if that island was

How can there be such a thing as
over-production while people want? All these things that are said to
be over-produced are desired by many people. Why do they not get
them? They do not get them because they have not the means to buy
them; not that they do not want them. Why have not they the means to
buy them? They earn too little. When the great masses of men have to
work for an average of $1.40 a day, it is no wonder that great
quantities of goods cannot be sold. Now why is it that men have to work
for such low wages? Because
if they were to demand higher wages there are plenty of unemployed
men ready to step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed
men who compel that fierce competition that drives wages down to the
point of bare subsistence. Why is it that there are men who cannot
get employment? Did you ever think what a strange thing it is that
men cannot find employment? Adam had no difficulty in finding
employment; neither had Robinson Crusoe; the finding of employment
was the last thing that troubled them. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If men cannot find an employer,
why cannot they employ
themselves? Simply because they are shut out from the element on
which human labour can alone be exerted. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Men are compelled to compete
with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been
robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves; because
they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
paving some other human creature for the privilege.</span> </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I do not mean to say that even
after you had set right this
fundamental injustice, there would not be many things to do; but this
I do mean to say, that our treatment of land lies at the bottom of
all social questions. This I do mean to say, that, do what you
please, reform as you may, <b>you never can get rid of wide-spread

value &#8212; that will be the result &#8212; that and nothing else.

    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <strong>With both anarchists and socialists, we, who for want of a better
      term have come to call ourselves single-tax men, fundamentally differ. </strong>We regard
      them as erring in opposite directions &#8212; the one in ignoring the social
      nature of man, the other in ignoring his individual nature. While we see
      that man is primarily an individual, and that nothing but evil has come
      or can come from the interference by the state with things that belong
      to individual action, we also see that he is a social being, or, as Aristotle
      called him, a political animal, and that the state is requisite to social
      advance, having an indispensable place in the natural order. Looking on
      the bodily organism as the analogue of the social organism, and on the
      proper functions of the state as akin to those that in the human organism
      are discharged by the conscious intelligence, while the play of individual
      impulse and interest performs functions akin to those discharged in the
      bodily organism by the unconscious instincts and involuntary motions, the
      anarchists seem to us like men who would try to get along without heads
      and the socialists like men who would try to rule the wonderfully complex
      and delicate internal relations of their frames by conscious will.</p>
  <p>The philosophical anarchists of whom I speak are few in number, and of little
    practical importance. It is with socialism in its various phases that we
    have to do battle.</p>
  <p><strong>With the socialists we have some points of agreement, for we recognize
      fully the social nature of man and believe that all monopolies should be
      held and
    governed by the state. In these, and in directions where the general health,
    knowledge, comfort and convenience might be improved, we, too, would extend
    the functions of the state. </strong></p>
  <p>But it seems to us the vice of socialism in all its degrees is its want
    of radicalism, of going to the root. It takes its theories from those who
    have sought to justify the impoverishment of the masses, and its advocates
    generally teach the preposterous and degrading doctrine that slavery was
    the first condition of labor. It assumes that the tendency of wages to a
    minimum is the natural law, and seeks to abolish wages; it assumes that the
    natural result of competition is to grind down workers, and seeks to abolish
    competition by restrictions, prohibitions and extensions of governing power.
    Thus mistaking effects for causes, and childishly blaming the stone for hitting
    it, it wastes strength in striving for remedies that when not worse are futile.
    Associated though it is in many places with democratic aspiration, yet its
    essence is the same delusion to which the children of Israel yielded when
    against the protest of their prophet they insisted on a king; the delusion
    that has everywhere corrupted democracies and enthroned tyrants &#8212; that
    power over the people can be used for the benefit of the people; that there
    may be devised machinery that through human agencies will secure for the
    management of individual affairs more wisdom and more virtue than the people
    themselves possess.<br>
    This superficiality and this tendency may be seen in all the phases of socialism.</p>
  <p>Take, for instance, protectionism. What support it has, beyond the mere
    selfish desire of sellers to compel buyers to pay them more than their goods
    are worth, springs from such superficial ideas as that production, not consumption,
    is the end of effort; that money is more valuable than money&#8217;s-worth,
    and to sell more profitable than to buy; and above all from a desire to limit
    competition, springing from an unanalyzing recognition of the phenomena that
    necessarily follow when men who have the need to labor are deprived by monopoly
    of access to the natural and indispensable element of all labor. Its methods
    involve the idea that governments can more wisely direct the expenditure
    of labor and the investment of capital than can laborers and capitalists,
    and that the men who control governments will use this power for the general
    good and not in their own interests. They tend to multiply officials, restrict
    liberty, invent crimes. They promote perjury, fraud and corruption. And they
    would, were the theory carried to its logical conclusion, destroy civilization
    and reduce mankind to savagery.</p>
  <p>Take trades-unionism. While within narrow lines trades-unionism promotes
    the idea of the mutuality of interests, and often helps to raise courage
    and further political education, and while it has enabled limited bodies
    of working-men to improve somewhat their condition, and gain, as it were,
    breathing-space, yet it takes no note of the general causes that determine
    the conditions of labor, and strives for the elevation of only a small part
    of the great body by means that cannot help the rest. Aiming at the restriction
    of competition &#8212; the limitation of the right to labor, its methods
    are like those of an army, which even in a righteous cause are subversive
    of liberty and liable to abuse, while its weapon, the strike, is destructive
    in its nature, both to combatants and non-combatants, being a form of passive
    war. To apply the principle of trades-unions to all industry, as some dream
    of doing, would be to enthrall men in a caste system. ...</p>
  <p>As for thoroughgoing socialism, which is the more to be honored as having
    the courage of its convictions, it would carry these vices to full expression.
    Jumping to conclusions without effort to discover causes, it fails to see
    that oppression does not come from the nature of capital, but from the wrong
    that robs labor of capital by divorcing it from land, and <strong>that creates
    a fictitious capital that is really capitalized monopoly.</strong> It fails to see that
    it would be impossible for capital to oppress labor were labor free to the
    natural material of production; that the wage system in itself springs from
    mutual convenience, being a form of cooperation in which one of the parties
    prefers a certain to a contingent result; and that what it calls the &#8220;iron
    law of wages&#8221; is not the natural law of wages, but only the law of
    wages in that unnatural condition in which men are made helpless by being
    deprived of the materials for life and work. <strong>It fails to see that
    what it mistakes for the evils of competition are really the evils of restricted
    competition &#8212; are due to a one-sided competition to which men are forced
    when deprived of land. </strong>While its methods, the organization of men into industrial
    armies, the direction and control of all production and exchange by governmental
    or semi-governmental bureaus, would, if carried to full expression, mean
    Egyptian despotism.</p>
  <p>We differ from the socialists in our diagnosis of the evil and we differ
    from them as to remedies. We have no fear of capital, regarding it as the
    natural handmaiden of labor; we look on interest in itself as natural and
    just; we would set no limit to accumulation, nor impose on the rich any burden
    that is not equally placed on the poor; we see no evil in competition, but
    deem unrestricted competition to be as necessary to the health of the industrial
    and social organism as the free circulation of the blood is to the health
    of the bodily organism &#8212; to be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation
    is to be secured. We would simply take for the community what belongs to
    the community, the value that attaches to land by the growth of the community;
    leave sacredly to the individual all that belongs to the individual; and,
    <strong>treating necessary monopolies as functions of the state, abolish all restrictions
    and prohibitions save those required for public health, safety, morals and
    convenience.</strong></p>
  <p>But the fundamental difference &#8212; the difference I ask your Holiness
    specially to note, is in this: socialism in all its phases looks on the evils
    of our civilization as springing from the inadequacy or inharmony of natural
    relations, which must be artificially organized or improved. In its idea
    there devolves on the state the necessity of intelligently organizing the
    industrial relations of men; the construction, as it were, of a great machine
    whose complicated parts shall properly work together under the direction
    of human intelligence. This is the reason why socialism tends toward atheism.
    Failing to see the order and symmetry of natural law, it fails to recognize
    God. ...</p>
  <p>This is not to say that all wages must fall to this point, but that the
    wages of that necessarily largest stratum of laborers who have only ordinary
    knowledge, skill and aptitude must so fall. The wages of special classes,
    who are fenced off from the pressure of competition by peculiar knowledge,
    skill or other causes, may remain above that ordinary level. Thus, where
    the ability to read and write is rare its possession enables a man to obtain
    higher wages than the ordinary laborer. But as the diffusion of education
    makes the ability to read and write general this advantage is lost. So when
    a vocation requires special training or skill, or is made difficult of access
    by artificial restrictions, the checking of competition tends to keep wages
    in it at a higher level. But as the progress of invention dispenses with
    peculiar skill, or artificial restrictions are broken down, these higher
    wages sink to the ordinary level. And so, it is only so long as they are
    special that such qualities as industry, prudence and thrift can enable the
    ordinary laborer to maintain a condition above that which gives a mere living.
    Where they become general, the law of competition must reduce the earnings
    or savings of such qualities to the general level &#8212; which, <strong>land
    being monopolized and labor helpless</strong>, can be only that at which the next lowest
    point is the cessation of life.</p>
  <p>Or, to state the same thing in another way: <strong>Land being necessary to life
    and labor, its owners will be able, in return for permission to use it, to
    obtain from mere laborers all that labor can produce, save enough to enable
    such of them to maintain life as are wanted by the landowners and their dependents.</strong></p>
  <p>Thus, where private property in land has divided society into a landowning
    class and a landless class, there is no possible invention or improvement,
    whether it be industrial, social or moral, which, so long as it does not
    affect the ownership of land, can prevent poverty or relieve the general
    conditions of mere laborers. For whether the effect of any invention or improvement
    be to increase what labor can produce or to decrease what is required to
    support the laborer, it can, so soon as it becomes general, result only in
    increasing the income of the owners of land, without at all benefiting the
    mere laborers. In no event can those possessed of the mere ordinary power
    to labor, a power utterly useless without the means necessary to labor, keep
    more of their earnings than enough to enable them to live.</p>
  <p>How true this is we may see in the facts of today. In our own time invention
    and discovery have enormously increased the productive power of labor, and
    at the same time greatly reduced the cost of many things necessary to the
    support of the laborer. Have these improvements anywhere raised the earnings
    of the mere laborer? Have not their benefits mainly gone to the owners of
    land &#8212; enormously increased land values?</p>
  <p>I say mainly, for some part of the benefit has gone to the cost of monstrous
    standing armies and warlike preparations; to the payment of interest on great
    public debts; and, largely disguised as interest on fictitious capital, to
    the owners of monopolies other than that of land. But improvements that would
    do away with these wastes would not benefit labor; they would simply increase
    the profits of landowners. Were standing armies and all their incidents abolished,
    <em><strong>were all monopolies other than that of land done away with</strong></em>, were governments
    to become models of economy, were the profits of speculators, of middlemen,
    of all sorts of exchangers saved, were every one to become so strictly honest
    that no policemen, no courts, no prisons, no precautions against dishonesty
    would be needed &#8212; the result would not differ from that which has followed
    the increase of productive power. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

      the Right of Property in Land</a> (Scotland, 1782)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All property ought to be the
reward of industry; all industry ought to
be secure of its full reward; the exorbitant right of the landholders
subverts both these maxims of good policy. It is the indirect influence
of this monopoly which</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>&nbsp;makes a poors-rate necessary; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>requires unnatural
severity in penal laws; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>renders sumptuary laws unpolitical, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the
improvement of machinery for facilitating labour unpopular, and perhaps
pernicious. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The oppressed state of the
cultivators, being universal,
has been regarded by themselves and others as necessary and
irremediable. A sound policy respecting property in land is perhaps the
greatest improvement that can be made in human affairs. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The chief obstacle to rapid
improvement of agriculture is plainly that
monopoly of land which resides in the proprietors, and which the
commercial system of the present age has taught them to exercise with
artful strictness, almost everywhere. </span>Hereafter, perhaps, some
fortunate nation will give the example of setting agriculture free from
its fetters. A new emulation will then arise among the nations
hastening to acquire that higher vigour and prosperity, which the
emancipation of the most useful of all arts cannot fail to produce.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The actual state of Europe, with respect to property in land, is
very
different from what might be desired. <span style="font-weight: bold;">That
exclusive right to the
improvable value of the soil which a few men, never in any country
exceeding one hundredth part of the community, are permitted to
engross, is a most oppressive privilege: </span>by its operation, the
happiness of mankind has been for ages more invaded and restrained,
than by all the tyranny of kings, the imposture of priests, and the
chicane of lawyers taken together, though these are supposed to be the
greatest evils that afflict the societies of human kind.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... By exacting exorbitant rents, they exercise a most
pernicious usury,
and deprive industry that is actually exerted of its due reward. By
granting only short leases, they stifle and prevent the exertion of
that industry which is ready at all times to spring up, were the
cultivation of the soil laid open upon equitable terms. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The monopoly of rude materials,</span>
indispensably requisite for carrying on
any branch of industry, is far more pernicious than the monopoly of
manufactured commodities ready for consumption. The monopoly possessed
by landholders is of the first sort, and affects the prime material of
the most essential industry.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The monopoly possessed by land-holders enables them to deprive
the
peasants not only of the due reward of industry exercised on the soil,
but also of that which they may have opportunity of exercising in any
other way, and on any other subject; and hence arises the most obvious
interest of the landholder, in promoting manufactures. </small><br>
<br>
<small>That nation is greatly deceived and misled which bestows any
encouragement on manufactures for exportation, or for any purpose but
the necessary internal supply, until the great manufactures of grain
and pasturage are carried to their utmost extent -- it can never be in
the interest of the community; it may be in that of the landholders,
who desire indeed to be considered as the nation itself, or at least as
being representatives of the nation, and having the same interest with
the whole body of the people.</small><br>
<br>
<small>(When mention is made in political reasonings of the interest of
any
nation, and those circumstances, by which it is supposed to be injured
or promoted, are canvassed, it is generally the interest of the
landholders that is kept in view.)</small><br>
<br>
<small>In fact, however, their interest is, in some most important
respects,
directly opposite to that of the great body of the community, over whom
they exercise an ill-regulated jurisdiction, together with an
oppressive monopoly in the commerce of land to be hired for
cultivation. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Property in Land, as at present established, is a monopoly of
the most
pernicious kind. The interest of landholders is substituted for that of
the community; it ought to be the same, but it is not. The landholders
of a nation levy the most oppressive of all taxes; they receive the
most unmerited of all pensions: if tithes are oppressive to industry,
rents capable of being raised from time to time are much more so. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>While the cultivable lands remain locked up, as it were, under
the
present monopoly, any considerable increase of population, though it
seems to add to the public strength, must have a pernicious influence
on the relative interests of society, and the happiness of the greater
number. By diminishing the wages of labour, it favours the rich,
fosters their luxury, their vanity, their arrogance; while on the other
hand, it deprives the poor of some share of their just reward and
necessary subsistence. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Debate: Single Tax vs Social Democracy&nbsp; (1889)</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We would abolish all taxes,
and begin with the most important of
all monopolies, the fruitful parent of lesser monopolies, that
monopoly which disinherits men of their birthright; that monopoly
which puts m the hands of some that, element absolutely indispensable
to the use of all; and we believe not that labour is a poor weak
thing that must be coddled or protected by Government. We believe
that labour is the producer of all wealth &#8211; (applause) &#8211;
that all labour wants is a fair field and no favour, and, therefore,
as against the doctrines of restriction we raise the banner of
liberty and equal right in the gospel of free, fair play. (Loud
cheers.) ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>What we want is full competition.
(Hear, hear.) What we want to do is to abolish monopolies, and it is
to these monopolies, and not to the earnings of capital, that the
great fortunes to which my opponent has alluded are due. </small><br>
<br>
<small>What are the
causes of these big fortunes? In the United States, go wherever you
please, you find that the real element is land ownership. It is a
great mistake to think that the only landlords are those which pose
as such. today, who are the great owners of the Irish estates? Not
so much the Irish landlords as the English banks and insurance
societies. (Hear, hear.) Take our, Jay Gould, the most conspicuous
example of a great fortune made outside the rise of land values. He
made his first stride by getting hold of a piece of land and taking
advantage of its rise in value, and he is today the owner of
millions of acres. He made his money in what? In a public franchise,
that we would abolish.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Capital is wealth produced by labour from
land, used again in increasing the production of wealth. And not only
will it not hurt labour to leave to capital its full reward but we
must leave to capital its full natural reward, if we would have a
progressive community &#8211; (cheers) &#8211; and if we would give
each what is his due. (Hear, hear.) What the labourers have to fight
against is not competition &#8211; (hear hear and &#8220;Yes&#8221;)
&#8211; but the restriction of production to their injury. Let there
be competition all around from the highest to the lowest, fencing in
no class against competition.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abolish
monopoly everywhere, put all
men on an equal footing and then trust to freedom.</span> In that way
we
would have the most delicate system of co-operation that can possibly
be devised by the wit of man. </small><br>
<br>
<small>The fight of labour is not against
capital; it is against monopoly. Why just think of that state of
things. when all the means of production belong to the community and
all production is regulated by the State, when every individual would
have, his work, his time of work, and everything else prescribed for
him; when it would be utterly impossible for men to employ
themselves! To abolish competition you must have restriction; you
must call on the coercive powers of the State. How else are you going
to do it? Supposing you organise industry in the way our friends
dream of, if any individuals go outside of this organization and
propose to compete with it, how are you going to stop their
competition but by coming in with the strong arm of the law, and
putting an end to it? Why such a state of society, instead of being
the ideal to which the Anglo-Saxon community ought to aspire, would
be going back to a worse despotism than, that of ancient, Egypt.
(Applause and cries of &#8220;No, no.&#8221;)&nbsp;
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Mr Hyndman says that in San Francisco as in other new
countries he has seen men looking vainly for work though there is
unemployed land there. That is true; but he never saw a man looking
vainly for work where the land was not fenced in and monopolised.
(Applause.). What the Single Tax would do would be to break down that
monopoly; to make it impossible for any man to hold valuable land
without putting it into use; compel those who are now holding land
unemployed to use it themselves or sell out to someone else who
would. (Hear, hear.)&nbsp; ...&nbsp;

Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
Land for the People</a> (1889 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I said that rent is a natural
thing. So it is. Where one man, all
rights being equal, has a piece of land of better quality than
another man, it is only fair to all that he should pay the
difference. Where one man has a piece of land and others have none,
it gives him a special advantage; it is only fair that he should pay
into the common fund the value of that special privilege granted him
by the community. That is what is called <b>economic rent</b>.<br>
<br>
BUT over and above the economic rent there is the power that comes
by monopoly, there is the power to extract a rent, which may be
called <b>monopoly rent</b>. On this island that I have supposed we
go and settle on, under the plan we have proposed each man should pay
annually to the special fund in accordance with the special privilege
the peculiar value of the piece of land he held, and those who had
land of no peculiar value should pay nothing. That rent that would be
payable by the individual to the community would only amount to the
value of the special privilege that he enjoyed from the community.
But if one man owned the island, and if we went there and you people
were fools enough to allow me to lay claim to the ownership of the
island and say it belonged to me, then 1 could charge a monopoly
rent; I could make you pay me every penny that you earned, save just
enough for you to live; and the reason I could not make you pay more
is simply this, that if you would pay more you would die.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>THE power to exact that monopoly rent comes from the power to
hold
land idle -- comes from the power to keep labor off the land. Tax up
land to its full value and that power would be gone; the richest
landowners could not afford to hold valuable land idle. Everywhere
that simple plan would compel the landowner either to use his land or
to sell out to some one who would; and the rent of land would then
fall to its true economic rate--the value of the special privilege it
gave would go not to individuals, but to the general community, to be
used for the benefit of the whole community.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But to the changes produced by
growth are, with us, added the
changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency of
steam and of machinery is to the division of labor, to the
concentration of wealth and power. Workmen are becoming massed by
hundreds and thousands in the employ of single individuals and firms;
small storekeepers and merchants are becoming the clerks and salesmen
of great business houses; we have already corporations whose revenues
and pay rolls belittle those of the greatest States. And with this
concentration grows the facility of combination among these great
business interests. How readily the railroad companies, the coal
operators, the steel producers, even the match manufacturers,
combine, either to regulate prices or to use the powers of
government! The tendency in all branches of industry is to the
formation of rings against which the individual is helpless, and
which exert their power upon government whenever their interests may
thus be served. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
It is not merely positively, but negatively, that great
aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to
corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of
the people. </span>"Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars --
except
two million dollars." <span style="font-weight: bold;">Great wealth
always supports the party in
power, no matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for
reform, for it instinctively fears change. It never struggles against
misgovemment. When threatened by the holders of political power it
does not agitate, nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is
in this way, no less than by its direct interference, that aggregated
wealth corrupts government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our
organized lobbies, both legislative and Congressional, rely as much
upon the fears as upon the hopes of moneyed interests.</span> When
"business" is dull, their resource is to get up a bill which some
moneyed interest will pay them to beat. So, too, these large moneyed
interests will subscribe to political funds, on the principle of
keeping on the right side of those in power, just as the railroad
companies deadhead [transport for free] President
[Chester A.] Arthur when he goes to Florida to fish. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That he who produces should have,
that he who saves should
enjoy, is consistent with human reason and with the natural order.
But existing inequalities of wealth cannot be justified on this
ground. As a matter of fact, how many great fortunes can be
truthfully said to have been fairly earned? How many of them
represent wealth produced by their possessors or those from whom
their present possessors derived them? Did there not go to the
formation of all of them something more than superior industry and
skill? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Such qualities may give the
first start, but when fortunes
begin to roll up into millions there will always be found some
element of monopoly, some appropriation of wealth produced by others.
Often mere is a total absence of superior industry, skill or
self-denial, and merely better luck or greater unscrupulousness.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Sources of Great
Wealth</b>
</small><br>
<small> An acquaintance of mine died in San Francisco recently,
leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in
England. I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more
temperate than he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This
man did not get his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He
no more produced it than did those lucky relations in England who may
now do nothing for the rest of their lives. He became rich by getting
hold of a piece of land in the early days, which, as San Francisco
grew, became very valuable. His wealth represented not what he had
earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of the earth's surface
enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the
other day, leaving $3,000,000.
He may or may not have been particularly industrious, skilful and
economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that he got
so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby
through a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against
the pauper labor of Europe," gave him the advantage of a
sixty-per-cent, tariff. To the day of his death he was a stanch
protectionist, and said free trade would ruin our "infant
industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to lay by
from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by
the tariff that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's
earnings.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Beneath all political
problems lies the social problem of
the distribution of wealth."</small></center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element of monopoly, of
appropriation and spoliation
will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account for
all great fortunes....</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt
fortune. The first Vanderbilt was a
boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it. But it was not
working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money
enough he used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He
ran off opposition lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel.
Then he went into railroads, pursuing the same tactics. The
Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working and saving than did the
fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune.
Mr. Gould might have got his
first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial. But
it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions.
It was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures,
getting up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock
values and transportation rates. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great
fortunes which the Pacific
railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations
of Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by
monopolizing and gouging. And so of fortunes made by such
combinations as the Standard Oil Company, the Bessemer Steel Ring,
the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and the various rings
for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper labor of
Europe." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of
successful patents. Like that
element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased value of
land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I am
not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make
fortunes out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and,
in fact, through nearly all
acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes, these
elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me
recently, "It is not on our ordinary business that we make our money;
it is where we can get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally
true.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Evils of
Monopolists</b></small><br>
<small> Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the
increase of land values has had, and is having, in the United States.
This is, of course, monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in
value it does not mean that its owner has added to the general
wealth. The owner may never have seen the land or done aught to
improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant city or in
another country. Increase of land values simply means that the
owners, by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed
before man was, have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth
produced by other people's labor. Consider how much the monopolies
created and the advantages given to the unscrupulous by the tariff
and by our system of internal taxation -- how much the railroad (a
business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water and other
similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and
stock-gambling, the destructive use of wealth in driving off or
buying off opposition which the public must finally pay for, and many
other things which these will suggest, have operated to build up
large fortunes, and it will at least appear that the unequal
distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many
who work little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the
earnings of the one class are, in one way or another, filched away
from them to swell the incomes of the other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly
making their way from the
ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the ranks of those
who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state of things
right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that
piracy was right and that no effort should be made to suppress
it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I am not denouncing the rich, nor
seeking, by speaking of
these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get a clear
understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that it
is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which
we give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by
law and by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so
enormously rich while others remain so miserably poor. If we look
around us and note the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation
which go to the building up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see
on the one hand now disingenuous are those who preach to us that
there is nothing wrong in social relations and that the inequalities
in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities of human
nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk as
though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
restricting the acquisition of wealth. Capital is a good; the
capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely
let any one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in
doing so.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There are deep wrongs in the
present constitution of society,
but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in
those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are
the laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from
bad
adjustments which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social
state is not that in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but
in which each gets in proportion to his contribution to the general
stock. And in such a social state there would not be less incentive
to exertion than now; there would be far more incentive. Men will be
more industrious and more moral, better workmen and better citizens,
if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his family, than
where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them until
some have far more than they could have earned, and others have
little or nothing.</small><small>&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The purely economic
ramifications of land monopoly are so vast as
to be staggering. Land monopoly does not affect rents alone. It
affects wages, prices, production, the cost of government, and the
distribution of purchasing power. It is the major cause of slums and
blighted areas. It is the greatest single breeder of revolution
around the world. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Well, exactly how did Henry
George propose to deal with the
problem of land monopoly?</b> Did he advocate that privately held
land should be expropriated and divided up? Quite the contrary. That
remedy is as ultimately ineffective as it is ancient. <b>There is
more truth than fiction in the aphorism that the French Revolution
delivered the peasants from the aristocrats only to hand them over to
the usurers, and what was true of the peasants was equally true of
the soil they tilled.</b> Thus has it ever been with programs of
expropriation and redistribution.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Under Henry George's system,
private land titles would not be
disturbed one iota.</b> No one would be expropriated. Instead, the
community would simply take something approaching the total annual
economic rent of land for public purposes. This amount would be
determined by the value of each site on the free market, not by any
arbitrary governmental fiat. In other words, the privilege of
monopolizing a site is a benefit received from society and for which
society should be fully compensated; and so, under the Georgist
system, the person who wished to monopolize a site would pay a rent
for it to the community, approaching 100 percent of its annual rental
value, exclusive of improvements.<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have spoken of land monopoly as
a cancer, and so it is. Yet land
often cannot be used efficiently unless monopolized. The Georgist
remedy does not provide for the excision of land monopoly but rather
for its transformation from malignant to benign. For the monopoly of
land can be fair and even salutary if the monopolizer pays into the
public treasury a sum that reflects substantially the market value of
his privilege.&nbsp; </small><small><a

  <p>Several prominent libertarians have recognized land value or rent as the
    source of public finance most compatible with liberty. Albert Jay Nock, for
    example,
      distinguished between the improper political means of obtaining wealth,
    such as from arbitrary taxation, and the proper economic means, from enterprise.
      He regarded public revenue from land rent as within the economic means,
    since
      the &#8220;monopoly of economic rent, on the other hand, gives exclusive rights
      to values accruing from the desire of other persons to possess that property;
      values which take their rise irrespective of any exercise of the economic means
      on the part of the holder.&#8221;25 (He used the term &#8220;monopoly&#8221; in
      its classical meaning, in which a new entrant cannot increase the supply,
      hence together, the landowners have a monopoly.) ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read

  <p>Everybody nowadays is anxious to help do something for the poor, especially
      they who are on the backs of the poor; they will do anything that is not
    fundamental. Nobody ever dreams of giving the poor a chance to help themselves.
    The reformers
      in this state have passed a law prohibiting women from working more than
    eight hours in one day in certain industries &#8212; so much do women love
    to work that they must be stopped by law. If any benevolent heathen see fit
    to come
      here and do work, we send them to gaol or send them back where they came
    from.</p>
  <p>All these prohibitory laws are froth. You can only cure effects by curing
      the cause. Every sin and every wrong that exists in the world is the product
      of law, and you cannot cure it without curing the cause. Lawyers, as a class,
      are very stupid. What would you think of a doctor, who, finding a case of malaria,
      instead of draining the swamp, would send the patient to gaol, and leave the
      swamp where it is? We are seeking to improve conditions of life by improving
      symptoms.</p>
  <p>Land Basic</p>
  <p>No man created the earth, but to a large extent all take from the earth
    a portion of it and mould it into useful things for the use of man. Without
    land
      man cannot live; without access to it man cannot labor. First of all, he
    must have the earth, and this he cannot have access to until the single tax
    is applied.
      It has been proven by the history of the human race that the single tax
    does work, and that it will work as its advocates claim. For instance, man
    turned
      from Europe, filled with a population of the poor, and discovered the great
      continent of America. Here, when he could not get profitable employment,
    he went on the free land and worked for himself, and in those early days
    there
      were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully rich and no extremely poor &#8212; because
      there was cheap land. Men could go to work for themselves, and thus take
      the surplus off the labor market. There were no beggars in the early days. <strong>It
      was only when the landlord got in his work &#8212; when the earth monopoly was
      complete &#8212; that the great mass of men had to look to a boss for a job.</strong></p>
  <p>All the remedial laws on earth can scarcely help the poor when the earth
    is monopolized. Men must live from the earth, they must till the soil, dig
    the
      coal and iron and cut down the forest. Wise men know it, and cunning men
    know it, and so a few have reached out their hands and grasped the earth;
    and they
      say, &quot;These mines of coal and iron, which it took nature ages and ages
      to store, belong to me; and no man can touch them until he sees fit to pay
      the tribute I demand.&quot; ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">read

<p>Albert Jay Nock &#8212; <a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">Henry George: Unorthodox
      American</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>About this matter of wages, George had had other testimony besides the old
      printer&#8217;s. On his way to Oregon a dozen years before, he fell in with
      a lot of miners who were talking about the Chinese, and ventured to ask what
      harm the Chinese were doing as long as they worked only the cheap diggings. &#8220;No
      harm now,&#8221; one of the miners said, &#8220;but wages will not always
      be as high as they are today in California. <a href="Population_Growth.html">As
      the country grows, as people come in, wages will go down</a>, and some
      day or other white people will be glad to get those diggings that the Chinamen
      are working.&#8221; George said that this idea, coming on top of what the printer
      had said, made a great impression on him &#8212; the idea that &#8220;<a href="Progress.html">as
      the country grew in all that we are hoping that it might grow</a>, the
      condition of those who had to work for their living must become, not better,
      but worse.&#8221; Yet
      in the short space of a dozen years this was precisely what was taking
      place before his own eyes.</p>
  <p>Still, though his two great questions became more and more pressing, he
    could not answer them. His thought was still inchoate. He went around and
    around
      his ultimate answer, like somebody fumbling after something on a table
    in the dark, often actually touching it without being aware that it was what
    he was
      after. Finally it came to him in a burst of true Cromwellian or Pauline
    drama out of &#8220;the commonplace reply of a passing teamster to a commonplace
      question.&#8221; One day in 1871 he went for a horseback ride, and as he
      stopped to rest his horse on a rise overlooking San Francisco Bay &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;I asked a passing teamster, for want of something better to say,
          what land was worth there. He pointed to some cows grazing so far off that
          they looked like mice, and said, &#8217;I don&#8217;t know exactly, but there
          is a man over there who will sell some land for a thousand dollars an acre.&#8217; Like
          a flash it came over me that there was the reason of advancing poverty
          with advancing wealth. <a href="Population_Growth.html">With the growth
          of population</a>, land grows in value, and the men who work it must
          pay more for the privilege.&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Yes, there it was. Why had wages suddenly shot up so high in California in
      1849 that cooks in the restaurants of San Francisco got $500 a month? The reason
      now was simple and clear. It was because the placer mines were found on <a href="Land_Common_Property.html">land
      that did not belong to anybody</a>. Any one could go to them and work them
      without having to pay an owner for the privilege. If the lands had been owned
      by somebody, it would have been land-values instead of wages that would have
      so suddenly shot up.</p>
  <p>Exactly this was what had taken place on these grazing lands overlooking
    San Francisco Bay. The Central Pacific meant to make its terminus at Oakland,
    the
      increased population would need the land around Oakland to settle on, and
    land values had jumped up to a thousand dollars an acre. Naturally, then,
    George
      reasoned, the more public improvements there were, the better the transportation
      facilities, the larger the population, the more industry and commerce &#8212; the
      more of everything that makes for &#8220;prosperity&#8221; &#8212; the
      more would land values tend to rise, and the more would wages and interest
      tend
      to fall.</p>
  <p>George rode home thoughtful, translating the teamster&#8217;s commonplace
      reply into the technical terms of economics. He reasoned that there are <a href="Three-Factor_Economics.html">three
      factors in the production of wealth</a>, and only three: natural resources,
      labor, and capital. When natural resources are unappropriated, obviously
      the whole yield of production is divided into wages, which go to labor,
      and interest,
      which goes to capital. But when they are appropriated, production has to
      carry a third charge &#8212; <a href="Rent.html">rent</a>. Moreover, wages
      and interest, when there is no rent, are regulated strictly by free competition;
      but rent is a monopoly-charge, and hence is always &#8220;all the traffic
      will bear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Well, then, since <a href="Natural_Resources.html">natural resource
        values</a> are purely social in their origin, created by the community, should
        not rent go to the community rather than to the Individual? <a href="Untaxing.html">Why
        tax industry and enterprise at all</a> &#8212; why not just charge rent?
        There would be no need to interfere with the private ownership of natural
        resources. Let a man own all of them he can get his hands on, and make
        as much out of them as he may, untaxed; but let him pay the community
        their
        annual rental value, determined simply by what other people would be
        willing to pay for the use of the same holdings. George could see justification
        for
        wages and interest, on the ground of natural right; and for private ownership
        of natural resources, on the ground of public policy; but he could see
        none for the private appropriation of economic rent. In his view it was
        sheer <a href="Theft.html">theft</a>.
        If he was right, then it also followed that as long as economic rent remains
        unconfiscated, <a href="Piracy.html">the taxation of industry and
        enterprise is pure highwaymanry</a>, especially <a href="Tariffs.html">tariff</a> taxation,
        for this virtually delegates the government&#8217;s taxing power to private
        persons.</p>
  <p>George worked out these ideas in a tentative way in a forty-eight page pamphlet
      with the title, &#8220;<em>Our Land and Land Policy, National and State</em>,&#8221; which
      did not reach many readers, but added something to his reputation as a tribune
      of the people. The subject mulled in his mind through five years of newspaper
      work, at the end of which he lost his paper and was once more on the ragged
      edge. He had begun a magazine article on the cause of industrial depressions,
      but was dissatisfied with it &#8212; one could do nothing with the topic
      in so little space. What was needed was a solid treatise which should recast
      the

Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
with differentiated special qualities is fixed</span>, e.g. land on
Wall
Street, or land suitable for growing macadamia nuts, or unloading
ocean vessels, or relaying radio signals; or residential land within
the New Trier Township High School District, or with ocean views and
breezes.&nbsp;
Substitution is generally possible but only at higher costs, resulting
in
rent gradients out from the best locations.&nbsp; This phenomenon is
well
studied and associated with the names of Von Thunen, Ricardo, and
many modem location theorists.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This quality makes land a
natural basis for oligopoly control of
markets,
or attempts at control.&nbsp;</span> Land bearing certain minerals,
like
diamonds or oil, is fixed and limited, in spite of new discoveries and
technologies.&nbsp; Sites most suitable for refining oil are limited:
they must be near markets, with access to cheap water transport and
pipelines, with "offset rights" to pollute air, with
"grandfather rights" to endanger or downgrade surrounding
residential lands and occasionally spill oil, with access to rails and
a
freeway system and a labor pool, with vast backlots for tank farms,
inside supportive political jurisdictions, and so on.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The fixity of land also lends
itself to stability of association among
oligopolists.</span>&nbsp; People come and go; capital turns over,
flows in
and
out; corporations, partnerships and syndicates are collapsed, merged,
refinanced, bankrupted and reorganized.&nbsp; Land remains: it is
always
in the same place, unmistakably identifiable and findable.&nbsp; It is
the permanent, underlying resource whose control is always the
objective
of the shuffling and roiling and strife above it.&nbsp; Its owners,
whoever they may be, will reliably join and support the local
employers'
association and their respective trade associations. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Tip O'Neil, the former Speaker of the US
Congress, is oft-quoted that "All politics is local politics." One
might say the same
of market power. Some lands are sold or leased with covenants against
competition, as Gimbel's Department Store holds a covenant
on a lot adjoining its parent store on 3rd Street and
Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee.&nbsp; Such anticompetitive
arrangements, however blatant, are intra-state, and apparently
immune from sanctions under US Federal anti-trust laws.&nbsp;
Scholars of industrial organization, many of them doing
outstanding work otherwise, pay these grass-roots matters little
heed.&nbsp; Researchers and activists concentrate on commodity markets
at national and world levels - the ones subject to Federal
sanctions, such as they are.&nbsp; They could probably find more
severe and blatant market failure in local land markets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Bargaining power increases with the number of options one
has.&nbsp; A large landowner with a chain of holdings in different
jurisdictions is positioned to bargain, to play off one against the
other.&nbsp; Thus, the Disney Corporation, 1991-93, considered
rebuilding
and expanding Disneyland at its current site in Anaheim, or in Long
Beach
where it had tenure over another suitable site.&nbsp; Using this
leverage
it won concessions from both cities, "finally" choosing to
expand in Anaheim.&nbsp; It has yet to do so, however, and nothing is
really final.&nbsp; Disney has many other sites around the world.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Likewise, land is a basis for oligopsony power in local labor
markets.
A city's labor pool is often faced with a local employers'
association whose membership is limited by the amount of industrial
land
within reach of the labor pool.&nbsp; Migrant farm labor is
faced with statewide employers' associations who have the advantages of
limited numbers, wealth, ancient roots and stability.&nbsp; Labor
unions that organize a local plant are faced with the threat of
the "runaway shop", or merely reallocating work among
plants, when the employer owns plants elsewhere.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Custom has dulled us to it, but a corporation is a pool of
separate
individual landowners bargaining in concert.&nbsp; A century ago,
corporations and limited liability were viewed with suspicion and
apprehension.&nbsp; Today, hundreds and thousands of separate
landowners
pool their corporate strength against labor, as a matter of
course.&nbsp;
Some employees bargain through unions, but not as a matter of
course, and hardly ever with international options.&nbsp; In the
US, less than 20% of the labor force is unionized, yet many,
probably most economists treat labor as the only threatening
monopoly.&nbsp; They see corporations as benign; a prime cause
carried by many economists today is to eliminate the corporate
income tax completely.&nbsp; Would we saw such support
for eliminating the payroll tax, the most obvious cause of unemployment.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land is the basis of
cartels.</span></small><br>
<small>There is too much farmland to permit of monopoly control through
private
action.&nbsp; However, production controls are exerted through public
action and force of law.&nbsp; These controls operate through control
of
land, limiting the allowable acreage in certain crops.&nbsp; Seldom is
there any attempt to control other farming inputs like labor,
fertilizer, farm capital or pesticides.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The best-known world cartel, OPEC, also works through control of
a
natural resource.&nbsp; It is important in its own right, obviously,
but
only one of a whole genus that it represents so
conspicuously.&nbsp; There is a tendency for cartels to overexpand
under
the price umbrella they support, and then collapse, taking with them a
lot of wasted capital.&nbsp; The effect of short-run monopoly may thus
be
long-run instability.&nbsp; Either way, the effects
are harmful and impoverishing.</small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land puts the lock
on monopoly.</span></small><br>
<small>A monopoly that limits output to raise
price, or a monopsony that
limits hiring, both throw workers on the street, and release other
resources too.&nbsp; Why do not these workers and these raw materials
combine in new firms?&nbsp; The monopoly would defeat itself if they
could.&nbsp; Clearly the monopoly must preempt some key
bottleneck.&nbsp; Land is the most likely one, because of
limited supply and non-reproduceability.&nbsp; Somehow, ordinary micro
"price theory"
never addresses this question.<small><span

Also included here are California-based corporations. A corporation's
"base" refers simply to the site of its headquarters: its shareholders
are scattered around the world, and the major shareholders, who
exercise control, are effectively screened behind layers of trusts and
financial institutions, so they are impossible to identify with
certainty.</small><br>

<small>
Institutions acquire land for their operations and then it tends to
stick to them for various reasons. It is tax free, for one, so long as
they retain it (and do not use it commercially). They are not subject
to corporate raids. Thus there is no mechanism whereby the current
opportunity cost of land is felt by management. It never appears in
their budgets; they never need compete for or justify it. College
Boards are not accountable to any public body, a precedent set by
Marshall's U.S. Supreme Court in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819.</small>

unrelated to their costs of production - that of land dramatically so,

the price extorted depends on what the buyer can afford to pay over and
above the wherewithal to survive- hence, the origin of the term

takes the annually-assessed rental value of land, created by the

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Ricardo believed that ground
rents and the value of land have a
tendency to rise continuously and that this benefits solely the

(1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Land Monopoly Usurps God's
Gifts to All.</b>
</small><br>
<small>Thus, on the highest and most unquestionable authority, are we
forced to conclude that, owing to the monopoly which the landlords
have usurped in the land of the nation, they sell out the "use of the
original and indestructible powers of the soil"; of "the natural and
inherent powers of the soil"; of "the natural powers of the soil";
that is to say, they sell the use of God's gifts like so many
articles of private property, and as if they were purely the result
of their own toil and labour. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><b>The Price of Land a Monopoly Price.</b></small><br>
<small>This privileged class not merely sells the use of God's gifts,
but
extorts for them a price which is most unjust and exorbitant; in
fact, they hardly ever sell them at less than scarcity or famine
prices. If a man wants to buy a suit of broadcloth, the price he will
be required to pay for it will amount to very little more than what
it cost to produce it -- and yet that suit of clothes may be a
requirement of such necessity or utility to him that he would
willingly pay three times the amount it actually cost rather than
submit to the inconvenience of doing without it. On the other hand,
the manufacturer would extort the last shilling he would be willing
to give for it, only that he knows there are scores of other
manufacturers ready to undersell him if he demanded much more than
the cost of its production. The price, therefore, of commodities of
all kinds that can be produced on a large scale, and to an indefinite
extent, will depend on the cost required to produce them, or at least
that part of them which is produced at the highest expense.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But there is a limited class of
commodities whose selling price
has no relation or dependence at all on the cost at which they have
been produced;</span> for example, rare wines that grow only on soils
of
limited extent; paintings by the old masters; statues at exquisite
beauty and finish by celebrated sculptors; rare books, bronzes and
medals, and provisions or articles of human food in cities during a
siege, and more generally in times of scarcity and famine -- these
commodities are limited in quantity, and it is physically impossible
in the circumstances existing to increase, multiply, or augment them
further. The seller of these commodities, not being afraid of
competition, can put any price he pleases on them short of the
purchasers' extreme estimate of the necessity, utility, or advantage
to themselves of such commodities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Fabulous sums of money, therefore,
have been expended in the
purchase of such commodities -- sometimes to indulge a taste for the
fine arts; sometimes to satisfy a passion for the rare and the
beautiful; and, sometimes, too, to gratify a feeling of vanity or
ambition to be the sole proprietors of objects of antiquarian
interest and curiosity. On the other hand, enormous sums of money
have been paid in times of scarcity or during a siege for the
commonest necessaries of life, or, failing these, for substitutes
that have been requisitioned for human food, the use of which would
make one shudder in circumstances of less pressing
necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html"><span

homeless, and the jobless could feed, shelter, and employ themselves.</span><span

for creating the Wasteland: it forces people into the "desert." There,
people find the oases controlled by more land monopolists who must be
paid a ransom for access to nature's life-sustaining water. </span>And
as we will see, the primary focus of Biblical economic laws was the
prevention of precisely this sort of usurpation of God's gifts to all
creatures. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>To recognize that "the earth is the Lord's" is to see that the
same God who established communities has also in his providence
ordained for them, through the land itself, a just source of revenue.
Yet, in the Wasteland in which we live, this revenue goes mainly into
the pockets of monopolists, while communities meet their needs by
extorting individuals the fruits of their honest toil. If ever there
were any doubt that structural sin exists, our present system of
taxation is the proof. Everywhere we see governments penalizing
individuals for their industry and creativity, while the socially
produced value of land is reaped by speculators in exact proportion to
the land which they withhold. The greater the Wasteland, the greater
the reward. Does this comport with any divine plan, or notion of
justice and human rights? Or does it not, rather, perpetuate the
Wasteland and prevent the realization of the Promised Land?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This not meant to suggest that
land monopolists and speculators have a corner on acquisitiveness or
the "profit motive," which is a well-nigh universal fact of human
nature. As a group, they are no more sinful than are people at large,
except to the degree that they knowingly obstruct reforms aimed at
removing the basis of exploitation. Many abide by the dictum: "If one

"We make money the old-fashioned way -- we earn it."<br>

others seems a simple enough moral tenet. But it seems to have lost its

grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><br>
Today, on the other hand, the unearned surplus which classical
economists called rent attaches to monopoly titles -- largely the
scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(2)</span></small> The
surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
rightful entitlement.<br>
<br>
Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of cities
where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
personal or market exchanges. The land value in New York City is higher
than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an

values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend also
to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
areas. Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in the
United States illustrate the point. ...&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any failure to pay back that
increment to society, or of government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. He witnessed first
hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development&#8212; even in his
time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. He
witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He realized that
people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. </span>It was
not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington
Plunkett writing at the same time:</small><br>

<small>All society needed to do was to collect the
economic rent from
landholders as its rightful due, a solution that became part of the
subtitle of his book, &#8220;the remedy.&#8221; Taxing the land (or, alternatively,
collecting the economic rent) was something common citizens could
understand. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>The justice in the Georgist tradition grows out of the premise
that one
is entitled to what one makes with one&#8217;s own hands or mind, but one is
not personally entitled to the gains that grow out of communal efforts.
Those are owed to and should be returned to the community. The justice
inherent in ecological economics, to the extent that it has solidified,
involves a recognition that preservation of natural capital is in the
interest of everyone. Both recognize and value the preservation of a
world commons in nature. Both appreciate the diversity preserved in
local community institutions and cultures. Both accept models based on
self-regulating assumptions &#8212; in one case using the phrase &#8220;steady
state&#8221; economics, in the other case the recovery of land rent in the
pursuit of open and stable markets over monopoly control. There is
great promise in the confluence of the two perspectives: they offer a
solution to the age-old challenge of resolving what in the world ought
to be public and common, and what else ought to be individual and
private. It remains now for proponents of each perspective to continue
exploring commonalities.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;
Alternatives that have been tried in the past, both classic capitalism
and socialism, suggest that neither has served the interests of
humanity well in the long term. Ecological economics has no theory of
property as such, and Georgism here offers a proven course of
application. To Georgists, ownership is linked to use and not to
freehold title. Holding individual property under license of the
community, and under terms which the community stipulates, is an idea
with a long tradition, well accepted, and needing only to be revived in
contemporary political, legal and economic discourse. Combined with the
pricing device of collecting land rent, ecological economics will have
a tool by which to circumscribe and even reverse the centrifugal forces
of a new economic imperialism. This is truly the beginning of a &#8220;Third
Way&#8221; when other theories seem to be moribund. ... <a

Hanno Beck:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Beck_BP.html">Bathroom Policy</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We were four college sophomores.
And we were not going to live in a
dorm, no sir, we figured that we were smart, mature fellows and so we
arranged to rent a house. Each person would have his own private
bedroom and we would share the bathroom. Four guys, one bathroom. That
sounds reasonable, right? ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Andrew was a nice fellow. He was thrifty and neat. But there was
a
difficulty. Once inside the bathroom, he wouldn't come out! The rest of
us would be waiting around to use the bathroom, pleading, urging,
begging. It did no good. Andrew took long stretches of time in the
bathroom. That restricted access for the rest of us, and yet we got no
compensation. Andrew was a <span style="font-weight: bold;">monopolizer</span>.
That felt unfair. <strong>... </strong></small><br>

than their
fair share of oil, fresh water, minerals, without compensating the rest
of us.</small></li>
  <li><small>We see people or corporations like Charlie, polluting the
land,
water and air with toxic wastes, chemicals, carbon in the atmosphere,
making the world less safe, forcing others to clean up, and they are
not compensating the rest of us.</small></li>
  <li><small>We see people or corporations like Andrew, monopolizing
resources
such as land -&#8211; an urban land speculator who holds an acre out of use,
anticipating a price rise, is displacing the rest of us, forcing
development out into the countryside. A single acre of downtown land
brought into use would save a dozen outside acres from premature sprawl
development.</small></li>

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_GRaCoM.html">Geoism, Recession
and Control of Monopolies</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>It seems that a great deal of anti-trust legislation from the Progressive
      Era had been aimed at monopoly in the flicks, which had started with Thomas
      A. Edison, who was as much a patent-litigation bully as he was a pure inventor.
      Much of this legislation became unravelled under President - guess who?
      - Ronald Reagan, spawn of the "entertainment" industry, and political voice
      for same. Vertical integration and media mergers and monopolization then
      ran wild. Disney under Eisner, of course, has played a role in this. Disney
      as real estate developer throws its heavy weight around brutally.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>This question arose in connection with Georgist taxation, and
          what it would do about Mr. Eisner, and overpaid CEOs like him. The
          answer, I think, is that "Georgism" involves more than taxation. It
          also involves promoting competitive markets and smiting or breaking
          up mergers, monopolies, and restraints of trade, by various means.
          It was, after all, part of first the Populist, and later the Progressive
          Movements. </small> </p>
  <p><small><strong>"Georgism" may be construed narrowly as a limited fiscal
        reform. Some of its votaries present it that way. As such, it is rightly
        suspected
      of being a bit cranky, and too limited. I see it as a broad front program
      to limit centralized monopoly control of industry, and promote free entry
      and free competition with proper regard for both consumers and workers.</strong></small><strong><br>
      </strong><small>&nbsp;</small><br>
          <small>Some free market purists may look askance at anti-trust actions.
          Consider, however, that we are dealing with people who hold patents,
          which are inherently anticompetitive, especially when used as clubs
          in the Edison manner. Consider also we are dealing with corporations,
          which are inherently combinations of capital made possible by the device
          of limited liability. When government gives an anticompetitive privilege,
          it seems fitting that government should limit the resulting abuses
        of power.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Judge Samuel Seabury: <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">An Address delivered
    upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
      We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
      which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
      men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
      contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed.</p>
  <p>... Indeed, if we try to envision, in view of our present location this
    afternoon, &quot;The
      World of Tomorrow,&quot; I have no hesitation in saying that if the world
      of tomorrow is to be a civilized world, and not a world which has relapsed
      into
      barbarism, it can be so only by applying the principles of freedom which
      Henry George taught. The principles to which I refer are:</p>
  <p>First, that men have equal rights in natural resources, and that these rights
      may find recognition in a system which gives effect to the distinction between
      what is justly private property because it has relation to individual initiative
      and is the creation of labor and capital, and what is public property because
      it is either a part of the natural resources of the country, whose value is
      created by the presence of the community, or is founded upon some governmental
      privilege or franchise.</p>
  <p>Henry George believed in an order of society in which monopoly should be abolished
      as a means of private profit. The substitution of state monopoly for private
      monopoly will not better the situation. It ignores the fact that even where
      a utility is a natural monopoly which must be operated in the public interests,
      it should be operated as a result of cooperation between the representatives
      of labor, capital. and consumers, and not by the politicians who control
      the political state.</p>
  <p>We should never lose sight of the fact that all monopolies are created and
      perpetuated by state laws. If the states wish seriously to abolish monopoly,
      they can do so by withdrawing their privileges; but they cannot grant the privileges
      which make monopoly inevitable and avoid the consequences by invoking anti-trust
      laws against them.</p>
  <p>It is strange that the state, which has assumed all sorts of functions which
      it cannot with advantage perform, still persists in neglecting a vital
    function which it should and can perform &#8212; the function of collecting
    public revenues, as far as possible, from those who reap the benefits of
    natural resources.
      In view of public and social needs, it is remarkable that no effort has
    been made by governments to reduce the tax burdens on labor and capital,
    which are
      engaged in increasing production, by transferring them to those who restrict
      production by making monopoly privileges special to themselves. </p>
  <p>These monopolistic privileges are of course disguised under many different
      forms, but the task of ascertaining what they are, and their true value, is
      a task within the competency of government if it really desires to accomplish
      it. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

  3.0 &#8212; Chapter 8: Sharing Culture (pages 117-134)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In due time, cable companies began offering their thicker cables to Internet
    users. Phone companies also came up with a system &#8212; DSL &#8212; that
    squeezes more data through their skinny wires. There are thus now two good
    ways to get high-speed access to the Internet &#8212; if you can afford roughly
    $30 a month, or $360 a year. Since not everyone can afford this, however,
    we have what some people call a digital divide &#8212; a financial barrier
    to universal access.</p>
  <p>This is where the airwaves come in. Using digital signals, it&#8217;s now
    possible to bridge the last mile to the Internet through the public&#8217;s
    own airwaves. Not only that, it&#8217;s incredibly cheap to do so, using
    technologies like wi-fi. At the same time, another technical breakthrough
    is imminent: the Internet &#8212; including this last wireless mile &#8212; will
    soon be &#8220;thick&#8221; enough to carry data, telephone calls, and television
    pictures. In theory, a small public investment could bring all these services
    to the doorsteps of virtually everyone. There&#8217;d be no more need for
    private TV networks, telephone and cable companies. The so-called information
    highway would be, like public streets, truly open and free.</p>
  <p>This is an extraordinary possibility. Americans now pay some $300 billion
    a year for telephone and cable services; perhaps half of this could be saved.
    That&#8217;s the equivalent of raising every worker&#8217;s take-home pay
    by about $1,000 a year. It should be cause for celebration.</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s more, free universal Internet access would be a boon to the
    corporate side of the economy &#8212; another example of a commons having
    positive external benefits. Think of an urban shopping street, or Main Street
    in a small town. Merchants on these streets depend on foot traffic; the more
    passersby, the more sales they make. If someone put checkpoints or tollbooths
    on these streets, merchants would scream. So it is with the Internet. Everyone
    doing business on the Internet wants more traffic. Making the Internet free
    to all would be the best thing that ever happened to merchants.</p>
  <p>Except, of course, for the phone-and-cable duopoly. In several states, these
    powerful companies have pushed through laws prohibiting cities from offering
    wireless Internet service, and they&#8217;ve sponsored a similar ban in Congress.
    The companies say their right to profit trumps the consumer&#8217;s right
    to save money and a city&#8217;s right to serve its citizens. Many politicians
    still buy that argument, so the end of this story has yet to be written.</p>
  <p>A similar battle looms over what&#8217;s called &#8220;net neutrality.&#8221; At
    the moment, the Internet &#8212; like the telephone system &#8212; treats
    all content equally. No one&#8217;s data is discriminated against, and no
    one&#8217;s gets favored either &#8212; your personal webste is treated the
    same as Google&#8217;s. However, cable and phone companies want to create
    a two-tiered Internet, with some content providers getting slow speed and
    others &#8212; who pay the phone and cable companies &#8212; getting high
    speed. That would mean more revenue for the companies, but also a permanent
    divide between corporate content providers and everyone else.</p>
  <p>Congress is now considering bills both to allow and to ban such tiering,
    and the outcome as this is written is uncertain. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
