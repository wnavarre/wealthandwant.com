<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    As for thoroughgoing socialism, which is the more to be honored as having
      the courage of its convictions, it would carry these vices to full expression.
      Jumping to conclusions without effort to discover causes, it fails to see
      that oppression does not come from the nature of capital, but from the
      wrong that robs labor of capital by divorcing it from land, and that creates
      a fictitious capital that is really capitalized monopoly. It fails to see
      that it would be impossible for capital to oppress labor were labor free
      to the natural material of production; that the wage system in itself springs
      from mutual convenience, being a form of cooperation in which one of the
      parties prefers a certain to a contingent result; and that what it calls
      the &#8220;iron law of wages&#8221; is not the natural law of wages, but
      only the law of wages in that unnatural condition in which men are made
      helpless by being deprived of the materials for life and work. <strong>It
      fails to see that what it mistakes for the evils of competition are really
      the
      evils of restricted competition &#8212; are due to a one-sided competition
      to which men are forced when deprived of land.</strong> While its methods, the organization
      of men into industrial armies, the direction and control of all production
      and exchange by governmental or semi-governmental bureaus, would, if carried
      to full expression, mean Egyptian despotism.</p>
  <p>We differ from the socialists in our diagnosis of the evil and we differ
    from them as to remedies. We have no fear of capital, regarding it as the
    natural handmaiden of labor; we look on interest in itself as natural and
    just; we would set no limit to accumulation, nor impose on the rich any burden
    that is not equally placed on the poor; <strong>we see no evil in competition,
    but deem unrestricted competition to be as necessary to the health of the
    industrial
    and social organism as the free circulation of the blood is to the health
    of the bodily organism</strong> &#8212; to be the agency whereby the fullest
    cooperation is to be secured. We would simply take for the community what
    belongs to
    the community, the value that attaches to land by the growth of the community;
    leave sacredly to the individual all that belongs to the individual; and,
    treating necessary monopolies as functions of the state, abolish all restrictions
    and prohibitions save those required for public health, safety, morals and
    convenience. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  <p>Q38. Is there no danger that under the single tax scheming men of great
    intellect would be able to take advantage of their less intelligent brethren,
    and by the competitive system corral everything as they do now?<br />
A. If they did, it would not be by the competitive system, but because the competitive
system was still imperfectly developed. Competition is freedom, and such a thing
as you suggest could not be done where freedom prevailed. I believe that the
single tax would perfect competition. If it did, and at any rate to the extent
that it did, every one would get what he earned. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Co-operation and Competition<a name="Competition"></a> </span><br>
    <br>
MANY if not most of the writers on political economy have treated exchange as
a part of distribution. On the contrary, it belongs to production. It is by exchange,
and through exchange, that man obtains, and is able to exert, the power of co-operation
which, with the advance of civilization, so enormously increases his ability
to produce wealth. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe311.html">unabridged:
Book III, Chapter 11, The Production of Wealth: The Office of Exchange in Production</a> &#8226; <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/science/speIII_9.htm">unabridged
Chapter 9, The Office of Exchange in Production</a><br>
          <br>
THEY who, seeing how men are forced by competition to the extreme of human wretchedness,
jump to the conclusion that competition should be abolished, are like those who,
seeing a house burn down, would prohibit the use of fire. <br>
          <br>
The air we breathe exerts upon every square inch of our bodies a pressure of
fifteen pounds. Were this pressure exerted only on one side, it would pin us
to the ground and crush us to a jelly. But being exerted on all sides, we move
under it with perfect freedom. It not only does not inconvenience us, but it
serves such indispensable purposes that, relieved of its pressure, we should
die. <br>
          <br>
So it is with competition. Where there exists a class denied all right to the
element necessary to life arid labor, competition is one-sided, and as population
increases must press the lowest class into virtual slavery, and even starvation.
But where the natural rights of all are secured, then competition, acting on
every hand &#8212; between employers as between employed, between buyers as between
sellers &#8212; can injure no one. <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
On the contrary it becomes the most simple, most extensive, most elastic, and
most refined system of co-operation that, in the present stage of social development,
and in the domain where it will freely act, we can rely on for the co-ordination
of industry and the economizing of social forces. <br>
          <br>
In short, competition plays just such a part in the social organism as those
vital impulses which are beneath consciousness do in the bodily organism. With
it, as with them, it is only necessary that it should be free. The line at which
the state should come in is that where free competition becomes impossible &#8212; a
line analogous to that which in the individual organism separates the conscious
from the unconscious functions. There is such a line, though extreme socialists
and extreme individualists both ignore it. The extreme individualist is like
the man who would have his hunger provide him food; the extreme socialist is
like the man who would have his conscious will direct his stomach how to digest
it. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, chapter 28 <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT28.html#Chapter%2028">econlib</a><br>

<p>Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/debate_hyndman_1889.html">The
      Great Debate: Single Tax vs Social Democracy</a>&nbsp; (1889)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Mr Hyndman quarrels with
competition. (Hear, hear.) He wants
to abolish it, but to abolish competition would be to abolish
freedom. (Loud applause and cries of &#8220;No, no.&#8221;) How can you
abolish competition except by saying to man, &#8220;Thou shalt
not&#8221;? How can you abolish competition save by preventing men
from doing what they have a perfect right to do &#8211; (&#8220;No,
no,&#8221; and hear, hear) &#8211; and what it is for the interest of
the community that they should do? Why, today, what are the
grievances that the working classes everywhere justly complain of?
The restriction of competition. It is monopoly, and monopoly simply
means the restriction of competition. (Hear, hear.) </small><br>
<br>
<small>How is
competition to be abolished? We have a right to ask the Social
Democrats what they propose to do, and how they propose to do it. All
I can find in their platform that goes to the social question is
this: &#8220;The production of wealth to be regulated by society in
the common interests of all its members.&#8221; (Cheers.) &#8220;The
means of production, distribution, and exchange to be declared and
treated as collective or common property.&#8221; (Hear, hear.) </small><br>
<br>
<small>They
propose to take everything &#8211; (laughter and hear, hear) &#8211;
not merely that which belongs of natural right to all men equally
&#8211; namely, the land &#8211; but also that which by natural right
belongs to the man who has produced it. (Hear, hear.) How are they to
get possession of it? By buying it or by taking it? If by taking it,
it is a big job. (Hear, hear and laughter.) If by buying it, what are
you doing but taking the capital from the masses in order to give it
to those people whom you now say hold the capital? </small><br>
<br>
<small>You say the nation
ought to abolish competition. Why you could not abolish competition
without subjecting man to the worst form of tyranny &#8211; (Hear,
hear and &#8220;No, no&#8221;) &#8211; and without stopping all
progress. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It is where competition is not permitted that there is
stagnation. (Hear, hear.) It is the competition of manufacturer with
manufacturer that leads to the adoption of inventions in
manufactures. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>It is the competition of steamship owner with steamship
owner that gives you those greyhounds of the sea. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>It is the
competition of producer with producer, it is the competition of
tradesman with tradesman that brings to such a city as this all that
is necessary to supply its wants. (Dissent, and cries of
&#8220;Order&#8221; and cheers.) 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What we want is full
competition.
(Hear, hear.) What we want to do is to abolish monopolies, and it is
to these monopolies, and not to the earnings of capital, that the
great fortunes to which my opponent has alluded are due.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Capital is wealth produced by labour from
land, used again in increasing the production of wealth. And not only
will it not hurt labour to leave to capital its full reward but we
must leave to capital its full natural reward, if we would have a
progressive community &#8211; (cheers) &#8211; and if we would give
each what is his due. (Hear, hear.) What the labourers have to fight
against is not competition &#8211; (hear hear and &#8220;Yes&#8221;)
&#8211; but the restriction of production to their injury. Let there
be competition all around from the highest to the lowest, fencing in
no class against competition.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abolish
monopoly everywhere, put all
men on an equal footing and then trust to freedom.</span> In that way
we
would have the most delicate system of co-operation that can possibly
be devised by the wit of man. </small><br>
<br>
<small>The fight of labour is not against
capital; it is against monopoly. Why just think of that state of
things. when all the means of production belong to the community and
all production is regulated by the State, when every individual would
have, his work, his time of work, and everything else prescribed for
him; when it would be utterly impossible for men to employ
themselves! To abolish competition you must have restriction; you
must call on the coercive powers of the State. How else are you going
to do it? Supposing you organise industry in the way our friends
dream of, if any individuals go outside of this organization and
propose to compete with it, how are you going to stop their
competition but by coming in with the strong arm of the law, and
putting an end to it? Why such a state of society, instead of being
the ideal to which the Anglo-Saxon community ought to aspire, would
be going back to a worse despotism than, that of ancient, Egypt.
(Applause and cries of &#8220;No, no.&#8221;)&nbsp;
<strong>... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What I want to know is about the
other
things. How are all trades going to be organised? You are going to
begin with one here and there, you are going to end competition a
little at a time&middot;&#8211; a piece here and a piece there. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Wherever
you end competition you give some special privilege. Monopoly in what
does it consist? In the abolition of competition. </span>What are the
things
of which you complain in Government? The absence of competition. Your
House of Lords is not opposed to competition; it is fenced in by
monopoly (Loud applause.) So wherever you find a special privilege,
there you find it a special privilege because competition is
excluded. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What was the essence of slavery to
which Mr. Hyndman
has alluded? The prohibition of competition; so no one else could
employ the slave save his owner &#8211; the slave was not free to
compete with owner. (Hear, hear.) If you men seriously think of these
things you will see that the Social Democratic Federation vaguely
proposes, if it were possible to carry it out, would inevitably
result in the worst system of slavery. (Loud cries of &#8220;No;
no,&#8221; and &#8220;Order&#8221;) 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Simply imagine a state of things
  in
  which no one could work save under State control, in which no one
  could display any energy save under the control of a board of
  officials, and ask yourselves who this board of officials are likely
  to be. Socialism begins at the wrong end; it pre-supposes pure
  government; its dream is simply of a benevolent tyranny (&#8220;No,
  no.&#8221;)&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a
