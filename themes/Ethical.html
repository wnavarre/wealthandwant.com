<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
      Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What are the key ideas advanced by Henry George and promoted by his followers?
    Like Marx&#8217;s analysis and the political movement he inspired, George
    needs to be understood in historical context. Although not a trained economist,
    his ideas gained widespread currency in economic debates throughout much
    of the Western world in the late nineteenth century. Also like Marx, <strong>his
    analysis stemmed from both ethical and economic considerations. </strong>He was primarily
    concerned with exploring the reasons why poverty and destitution coexisted
    with economic growth, and saw the root cause of these problems in the prevailing
    policies towards land. It is this focus on land, contrasting with the Marxian
    focus on capital, that is the characteristically Georgist emphasis. <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong></font></p>
  <p>Georgism
      has a distinctive ethical basis. So a review of the contemporary relevance
      of Georgist political economy can usefully begin by making this explicit.
      The key moral issue is the private appropriation of public wealth. As George
      recognised, land is a &#8216;gift from nature&#8217; and, as such, is rightfully
      a community resource. Hence, those deriving benefits from the private ownership
      of land should recompense the community for the privilege. This principle
      has strong echoes of the idea of &#8216;usufruct&#8217;, a pre-capitalist
      term denoting a person&#8217;s legal right to use and accrue benefits from
      property that does not belong to them. In return, the user is obliged to
      keep the property in good repair and pay all costs as a &#8216;ground rent&#8217; (&#8216;Lectric
      Law Library, n.d). The concept of &#8216;usufruct&#8217; has fallen out of
      common usage, so one hesitates to try to revive it. Moreover, as Richards
      (2002) notes, &#8216;it is difficult to image how this word could be employed,
      or brought back into circulation, in the modern world, since we live in a
      world in which people tend to be remarkably unsympathetic to the property
      rights or claims of others&#8217;.</p>
  <p>However, the principle of &#8216;usufruct&#8217; goes to the heart of the
    question of how best to balance collective and individual rights and interests.
    George&#8217;s solution of a tax on the value of land squarely addresses
    this issue. By returning a proportion of the land value to the community
    in the form of taxation revenue, restitution would be paid for the use of
    a community resource. This is an ethical justification for land taxation.

      Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
      Henry George</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Ethics of Property</b>
</small><br>
<small>Any discussion of Henry George should include a consideration of
his ethical ideas, for throughout his works the question of right and
wrong is dominant. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and
Poverty</span>, for instance, he struck
this keynote: </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>'. ..whatever dispute arouses the
passions of men, the conflict is
sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it wise?' as to the
question 'Is it right?'. ..I bow to this arbitrament, and accept this
test."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George wrote as a social
philosopher. Therefore his preoccupation
in the field of ethics was with the relations of man to man, rather
than with man himself -- with stealing rather than with
thriftlessness. This necessarily involves the matter of property and
ownership. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once again, the student will find
George's analysis to be based on
the differences inherent in the two categories of land and products.
"The real and natural distinction is between things which are the
produce of labor and things which are the gratuitous offerings of
nature. ...These two classes of things are in essence and relations
widely different, and to class them together as property is to
confuse all thought when we come to consider the justice or the
injustice, the right or the wrong of property."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the moral basis of
property? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it not, primarily, the right of
a man to himself, to the use of
his own powers, to the enjoyment of the fruits of his own exertions?
... As a man belongs to himself, so his labor when put in concrete
form belongs to him. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And for this reason, that which a
man makes or produces is his
own, as against all the world -- to enjoy or to destroy, to use, to
exchange, or to give. No one else can rightfully claim it, and his
exclusive right to it involves no wrong to anyone else. Thus there is
to everything produced by human exertion a clear and indisputable
title to exclusive possession and enjoyment, which is perfectly
consistent with justice, as it descends from the original producer.
... </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a justification for
private property in products. But what
of land, which is not produced by man? Is there any other basis from
which a justification for private property in land might be derived?
In addition, is there anything in the right of private property in
products which precludes the right of private property in land? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George explains, "Now this [the
right of the individual to the
use of his own faculties] is not only the original source from
which all ideas of exclusive ownership arise ... but it is
necessarily the only source. There can be to the ownership of
anything no rightful title which is not derived from the title of the
producer and does not rest upon the natural right of the man to
himself. There can be no other rightful title, because (lst) there is
no other natural right from which any other title can be derived, and
(2nd) because the recognition of any other title is inconsistent with
and destructive of this."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To substantiate the first reason
he further said, </small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">Nature acknowledges
no ownership or control
in man save as the result of exertion. In no other way can her
treasures be drawn forth, her powers directed, or her forces utilized
or controlled. ...All men to her stand upon an equal footing and have
equal rights. She recognizes no claim but that of labor, and recognizes
that without respect to the claimant. If a pirate spread his sails, the
wind will fill them as well as it will fill those of a peaceful
merchantman. ...The laws of nature are the decrees of the Creator.
There is written in them no recognition of any right save that of
labor; and in them is written broadly and clearly the equal right of
all men to the use and enjoyment of nature; to apply to her by their
exertions, and to receive and possess her reward. Hence, as nature
gives only to labor, the exertion of labor in production is the only
title to exclusive possession (1879, rpt. 1958, pp. 335-36).</font></div>
  <small> </small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to the second reason he said: </small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="-1"><small><big>This
right of ownership that springs from
labor excludes the possibility of any other right of ownership. ...If
production give to the producer the right to exclusive possession and
enjoyment, there can rightfully be no exclusive possession and
enjoyment of anything not the production of labor, and the recognition
of private property in land is a wrong. For the right to the produce of
labor cannot be enjoyed without the right to the free use of the
opportunities offered by nature, and to admit the right of property in
these is to deny the right of property in the produce of labor. When
nonproducers can claim as rent a portion of the wealth created by
producers, the right of the producers to the fruits of their labor is
to that extent denied (1879, rpt. 1958, p. 336).</big> </small></font></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Private property in land,
according to George, is unjust because
it lets owners of land refuse access to land, and thereby threatens
livelihood and life itself. Private property in land is also unjust
because it enables owners of land to levy toll on production for the
use of land; therefore it is robbery. So another difference between
products and land, in George's view, is that private property in
products is right, and private property in land is wrong.</small><small>...

for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>

<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
The ethical case for taxing land is based on two premises.&nbsp; The
first is that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; This has not been
controversial since the end of slavery, so I will simply assume that
this is agreed.&nbsp; The second premise is that all people have equal
rights to natural opportunities.&nbsp; This is not so widely agreed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Natural opportunities include not only land, but also water,
fish in
oceans and rivers, the frequency spectrum, minerals, virgin forests,
and geosynchronous orbits.&nbsp; Some natural opportunities, such as
the opportunity to use the oceans for transport, are most valuable to
people when all are allowed to use them as they wish.&nbsp; (This does
not imply that their value is greatest when all can pollute as they
wish.)&nbsp; Other natural opportunities, such as most plots of land,
are most valuable when one person has exclusive use of them.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The processes that humans employ to determine who shall have
exclusive
use of natural opportunities are complex.&nbsp; To some extent,
opportunities are assigned to those who first make use of them.&nbsp;
However, another important component of the
natural-opportunity-assignment process is the ability and willingness
to use deadly force to exclude others.&nbsp; Americans from Europe
undertook some negotiations with the native American Indians, but
primarily they threatened to kill the Indians if they did not agree to
move into smaller territories.&nbsp; All over the world, nations
emerged when war-minded leaders imposed their rule where they
could.&nbsp; We have built a relatively humane world on this violent
foundation, but the origins of the assignment of natural opportunities
cannot be characterized as just.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Nor would have been just (or efficient) to adhere to a rule of
initial
assignment based on first use. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Justice requires that we acknowledge the equal rights of all
persons to
the gifts of nature.&nbsp; At the level of relations among nations,
this requires every nation to determine whether it is using more than
its share of natural opportunities, and if it is using more than its
share, to compensate other nations that therefore have less than their
shares.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Within a nation, the requirements of justice are not so
rigorous, as
long as anyone who wishes can migrate to another nation and take with
him a claim to an equal share of natural opportunities.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>An additional ethical reason for recognizing equal rights to
natural
opportunities is that it may be necessary to secure world peace.&nbsp;

<br>
Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html">The
Political Economy of the Gospels</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>The message of the Gospels is that our sins are forgivable,
that
death is not to be feared because our true lives are spiritual rather
than physical, and that participation in the kingdom of God -- a new
and better life in this world as well as the next -- is accessible to
all who orient themselves to God.</small></p>
<p><small>Drawing on the Old Testament, Jesus taught that our first
commandment is that we love God with all our heart, and all our soul,
and all our mind, and all our strength, and that our second
commandment is that we love our neighbor as
ourselves.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>1</i></b></small></font> When
asked who our
neighbor is, he replied with the parable of the good Samaritan,
implying that anyone we encounter is our neighbor.
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font> Jesus taught an
ethic in which
there are no bounds on our obligations to others:&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... 
</span></span></small></p>
<p><small>When asked by Peter, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
against
me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" Jesus replied, "I say not
unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."&nbsp; In
other words, we are to
forgive indefinitely.</small></p>
<p><small>This unbounded obligation to others is reconciled with the
need to
survive through the introduction of the idea that it is not through
our own anxious efforts, but through God's provision for us that we
survive:<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p><small>The message of the Gospels denies the validity of concern for
material scarcity. This is made particularly clear in the accounts of
the feeding of the multitudes with just a few loaves and
fishes.</small></p>
<p><small>comprehending this counterintuitive idea, that material
scarcity
is not to concern us, is brought out by the accounts of how even
Jesus' disciples did not understand the message:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... 
</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p><small>Without a concept of material scarcity it is difficult to
construct an economic theory, as material scarcity is central to
economic theory. And yet, even without a concept of material scarcity
there is an allocation problem to be solved--the allocation of our
efforts.</small></p>
<p><small>In the parable of the talents we are told that we will be
expected
to accomplish something with the resources that are put into our
hands. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>8</i></b></small></font> This
parable is
followed in Matthew by a teaching that may be taken as an indication
of what constitutes accomplishment:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... </i></b></small></font></small><small></small></p>
<p><small>In other words, every person is a manifestation of God, and
anything that we can do to help anyone is to our credit.</small></p>
<small>There is thus an unlimited task for each of us. No one of us
will
ever be able to say, "I have done every last thing that might be
required of me. I have no further obligations." But neither are we to
be concerned that that which we have left undone might be held
against us. For if we refrain from judging others, we ourselves will
not be judged:&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong><br>
</small>
<p><small>With this message of the Gospels in mind, turn now to the
problem
of political economy, the problem of what principles ought to govern
the organization of the production of goods and their
distribution.</small></p>
<p><small>One might first ask whether the requirement that we abandon
concern for scarcity would preclude production. The answer is no, it
is not production that we are cautioned to avoid, but anxiety. There
are any number of reasons why we might allocate some of our time to
production, without being anxious about our own material
requirements. We feel called to undertake a particular kind of work,
so we do it, trusting that any material needs we may have will be
satisfied. If we want to undertake our productive activities in
conjunction with others, that's fine, too. Associating with others
provides us with opportunities to be useful to them.</small></p>
<p><small>Among those who are close to us there is no need for prices
and
markets, because we can see easily enough how we can be of service to
them. But human discernment is limited, and prices and markets help
us to be aware of what is valued by people who are less close to
us.<strong> ... </strong></small><small></small></p>
<p><small>Refraining from the use of force is a recurring theme in the
political economy of the Gospels. We are called to refrain from the
use of force in defense of property. We are called to refrain from
the use of force in financing public activities. We are called to
refrain from the use of force in providing for those who might
otherwise lack. And we show our love for those who do not wish to
participate in our political economy by leaving for them the same per
capita value of land and natural resources that we claim for
ourselves.</small></p>
<p><small>Consider now how this framework bears on some traditional
questions of economic ethics. Take first the problem of the just
price. This simply is not an issue. If two people have the
opportunity to trade--to cooperate--on terms that are mutually
agreeable to the two of them, it is not for us to say that they ought
to be trading on other terms. Between people who love one another,
the problem of settling on the terms of trade is no more difficult
than the problem when friends eat lunch together of deciding who will
pick up the tab, or how it will be split.</small></p>
<small>That those outside a relationship are not called upon to
prescribe
its terms is supported by a passage from
Luke: <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
Relations between employers and employees are a special case of
relations between traders. <strong>... </strong><br>
The problem of worker management is not a problem either. <strong>... </strong><br>
</small>
<p><small>Corporate responsibility may be more of an issue for a
Gospel-based political economy. The corporate form of organization
permits us to participate in the establishment and management of
firms while knowing very little about the other people with whom we
are involved or the actions that are taken on our behalf. If this
leads us to support implicitly actions of managers in their concern
for the bottom line that we could not in good conscience take
ourselves, then there is something troubling about our participation
in corporations. We need to find ways of managing the resources under
our control that do not lead us to endorse implicitly and to profit
from actions that we would not endorse directly or take ourselves.
</small></p>
<p><small>The grand question of economic ethics, the question of
whether
capitalism or socialism is the more appropriate form of political
economy, is another non-question from the perspective of the Gospels.
Everyone who wants to live under socialism should be free to live
under socialism, and everyone who wants to live under capitalism
should be free to live under capitalism. In whichever group we fall,
we will want to insure that those who want to organize their lives by
different principles of political economy have their share of land
and natural resources with which to do so.</small></p>
<p><small>A political economy based on the Gospels is a political
economy
based on love. As the First Epistle of John says, "There is no fear
in love; but perfect love casteth out
fear."<font size="-1"><small><b><i>17</i></b></small></font> To
construct a
political economy of the Gospels we must be free of fear: free of
fear that others may rob us; free of fear that others may not
contribute to the provision of public goods or to provision for those
who might otherwise lack; free of fear that our incomes will be too
low or the prices we face too high; free of fear that if we don't do
something, someone will be exploited. Only when love has replaced all
