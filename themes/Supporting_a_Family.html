  <p>How hard should life be for the average person? How hard should it be for

<p>    Henry George: <a

    Crime of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)  </p>
<blockquote>
    <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why,
      in the rudest state of
      society in the most primitive state of the arts the labour of the
      natural bread-winner will suffice to provide a living for himself and
      for those who are dependent upon him. </span>Amid all our inventions
      there
      are large bodies of men who cannot do this. What is the most
      astonishing thing in our civilisation? Why, the most astonishing
      thing to those Sioux chiefs who were recently brought from the Far
      West and taken through our manufacturing cities in the East, was not
      the marvellous inventions that enabled machinery to act almost as if
      it had intellect; it was not the growth of our cities; it was not the
      speed with which the railway car whirled along; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it was not the
      telegraph or the telephone that most astonished them; but the fact
      that amid this marvellous development of productive power they found
      little children at work. </span>And astonishing that ought to be to
      us; a
      most astounding thing!</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Talk about improvement in the
      condition of the working classes,
      when the facts are that a larger and larger proportion of women and
      children are forced to toil. </span>Why, I am told that, even here in
      your
      own city, there are children of thirteen and fourteen working in
      factories. In Detroit, according to the report of the Michigan Bureau
      of Labour Statistics, one half of the children of school age do not
      go to school. In New Jersey, the report made to the legislature
      discloses an amount of misery and ignorance that is appalling.
      Children are growing up there, compelled to monotonous toil when they
      ought to be at play, children who do not know how to play; children
      who have been so long accustomed to work that they have become used
      to it; children growing up in such ignorance that they do not know
      what country New Jersey is in, that they never heard of George
      Washington, that some of them think Europe is in New York. Such facts
      are appalling; they mean that the very foundations of the Republic
      are being sapped. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The dangerous man
      is not the man who tries to
      excite discontent; the dangerous man is the man who says that all is
      as it ought to be.</span> Such a state of things cannot continue; such
      tendencies as we see at work here cannot go on without bringing at
      last an overwhelming crash.&nbsp; ... <a

  <p>Alanna Hartzok: <a href="docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">Who Would Jesus Tax?
      The Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax Crusade</a> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A University of Alabama School of Law Professor has asked God's forgiveness
      for the years she lived in the sin of ignorance about tax injustice. Susan
      Pace Hamill, a tax expert, business consultant, and dedicated United Methodist
      church goer, thought there was a misprint when she first read that personal
      incomes as low as $4,600 for a family of four were being taxed by the state,
      while timber owners holding 71% of the land of Alabama were paying less than
      $1 per acre in property taxes. Two hours later she found out there had been
      no mistake and that Alabama has the most regressive tax code in the country.
      Her righteous rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated onto the national
      scene.<br>
        <br>
"As somebody who knows a lot about taxes, I could not have imagined a design
  of a tax structure this bad," she said in a <em>Tuscaloosa News</em>story last
  February. "The state's tax code is really horribly unjust and has no moral,
  ethical leg to stand on. Period."<br>
    <br>
    Alabamians with incomes under $13,000 pay 10.9 percent of their incomes in
    state and local taxes while those who make over $229,000 pay just 4.1 percent.
    Commercial property owners pay more than 50 percent of property taxes, with
    homes approaching one-third. Alabama's sales taxes are among the highest in
    the nation, up to 10 percent in some areas, and do not exempt even the most
    basic necessities such as food. The state's 1901 constitution was written primarily
    by large landholders to secure their economic interests, consequently property
    taxes are extremely light on their holdings. ... </p>
    <p>While resoundingly condemning the current system (she uses words like "horrific" and "monstrous
      injustice") Hamill clearly articulates a tax reform approach which shifts
      taxes off of low wage earners and onto large land owners. Through a combination
      of her own reasoning, caring heart, and inherent sense of justice and a
      thorough investigation of Judeo-Christian ethics, Hamill arrived at a tax
      policy approach
      which bears remarkable similarities to the economic justice crusades of
      19th century reformer, Henry George. ... <a href="docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">read
