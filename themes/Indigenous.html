    <p>Who is better off when land value is privatized? Those whose
          primary business is landlording, and most particularly those who landlord
          the most valuable land, the land which is supremely well located and best
          served by the investment of the taxpayers and the marketplace. The rest of
          us get to pay both for those services to the landlord and then we get to
          pay the landlord for the use of &quot;his&quot; land. </p>
    <p>The alternative? Let the land rent be passed through to the
        public treasury as our common treasure, and let that land rent be spent to
        benefit us all. If it causes the landlord's land to be worth more next year,
        that increase in value gets passed to the treasury, instead of becoming part
        of his private portfolio. </p>

LAND RIGHTS</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"When
the white man came we had the land and they had the Bible. They taught
us to pray with our eyes closed and when we opened them, they had the
land and we had the Bible."</span> - Jomo Kenyatta, (1889 - 1978),
prime minister of Kenya
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Before European settlement/invasion, Aboriginals generally, we
are
told, had a beautiful thing going - they really knew how to share. Each
tribal group was a custodian of a traditional area, and all were taught
how to look after and respect their ancestral land. They belonged to
the Earth, and not the other way around. No individual owned any land,
and none could personally profit from Nature's gifts.</small><br>
<br>
<small>These are Geonomic principles, pure and simple. However,
Geonomics has
developed things such that each person is, in effect, the co-owner of
the entire country. Geonomics further allows for those wishing to live
in fixed abodes to take advantage of infrastructure, allocating land of
greatly unequal value in an elegantly fair manner.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHITE-FELLA THINKING!</span></small><br>
<small>Geonomics has so much to offer the indigenous population (as
well as
everyone else), if only they knew of it. On top of all the other
tragedies Aboriginals have suffered at the hands of Europeans is the
fact that many have adopted the prevailing concept of land as property
and are thus claiming exclusive ownership of land rather than the more
traditional notion of guardianship.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another problem is that the planet is a much more crowded place
these
days, and there's not enough land to enable small groups to live on
large expanses of land as nomadic hunter-gatherers. And we can't turn
the clock back 200 years and return the continent to its original
inhabitants - indeed, if the federal government learned how to treat
refugees with a lot more respect, there's a good case for how Australia
has a moral duty to take in a lot more immigrants.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">SELLING YOUR MOTHER?</span></small><br>
<small>Given our admission of European culpability for all the misdeeds
of
settlement/invasion and its present-day consequences, it's time to talk
frankly about those Aboriginal leaders who are now claiming a spiritual
relationship with the land and that the Earth is their mother, yet in
the same breath asserting ownership of vast tracts of land with
exclusive rights of occupancy as well as mineral royalties. Or those
who say that their connection to the land is something deeply spiritual
and priceless &#8230;&#8230;. and they won't accept less than $5 billion a year in
rent!</small><br>
<br>
<small>These - even if well meaning - contortions, if carried through,
will
establish an institutionalised, perpetual race-based class of landlords
and tenants, and in so doing, perpetuate the very injustices we are
attempting to eradicate.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">"I SAW IT FIRST!"</span></small><br>
<small>And what, if anything, is the basis for the race-based privilege
of
indigenous land rights? "Prior occupancy", no less! So because
someone's distant ancestors, whom he never knew, got to a continent
first, they claim ownership! The logic of this declaration is certainly
worth examining. So then, what if new archeological evidence came to
light which revealed that a certain Aboriginal clan are the sole
descendants of the very first guy who crossed the Torres Strait? Could
this clan then say, "OK all you whitefellas and blackfellas descended
from the later arrivals &#8230;.. you all have to pay us the rent for living
in Australia, or clear out!"</small><br>
<br>
<small>Or what if Australia hadn't been occupied when the first
Europeans
landed? Could the king who sent the ship have personally claimed
ownership based on first occupancy, or would Australia more rightly
belong to the ship's captain? But hang on! - what if one of the oarsmen
jumped off the boat before the captain, and was first to hit the beach?
But, wait! - the oarsman was wearing boots, and his skin never touched
the soil until after the first mate slipped over on the beach and got a
face full of sand!</small><br>
<br>
<small>Steady on, guys - what about me?! Where's my share of the Earth?
Do I
have to return to England and Ireland where my ancestors had "prior
occupancy", and can I then tell those Pakistani and West Indian
immigrants to clear off or else pay me rent for standing on my
homeland? No-one stands on my spiritual motherland for nothing!</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">ACTUALLY, IT'S ALL PRETTY SIMPLE</span></small><br>
<small>The Earth and its bounty are the birthright of all humanity.
Land and
natural resources are our equal and common inheritance, regardless of
race, creed, or gender.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But it's true that culture, history, attachment to place and
arbitrary
national boundaries have complicated these straightforward principles
of human rights. And there is a clear case in Australia for studying
and acknowledging the shameful history of European invasion, saying
"Sorry" on behalf of our ancestors, and trying to make amends as best
we can. If this means special programs, roles, and grants for
Aboriginals in order to help them out of their appalling condition,
then let's do it. And we should acknowledge Aboriginals being the first
occupants, caretakers and custodians, but don't use that word
"ownership", OK?</small></div>
