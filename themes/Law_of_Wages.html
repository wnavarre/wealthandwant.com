<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Civilization that is Possible.</b> </small><br>
  <small>IN the effects upon the distribution of wealth, of making land private
  property, we may thus see an explanation of that paradox presented by modern
  progress. The perplexing phenomena of deepening want with increasing wealth,
  of labor rendered more dependent and helpless by the very introduction of labor-saving
  machinery, are the inevitable result of natural laws as fixed and certain as
  the law of gravitation. Private property in land is the primary cause of the
  monstrous inequalities which are developing in modern society. It is this,
  and not any miscalculation of Nature in bringing into the world more mouths
  than she can feed, that gives rise to that tendency of wages to a minimum &#8211; that "iron
  law of wages," as the Germans call it -- that, in spite of all advances in
  productive power, compels the laboring-classes to the least return on which
  they will consent to live. It is this that produces all those phenomena that
  are so often attributed to the conflict of labor and capital. It is this that
  condemns Irish peasants to rags and hunger, that produces the pauperism of
  England and the tramps of America. It is this that makes the almshouse and
  the penitentiary the marks of what we call high civilization; that in the midst
  of schools and churches degrades and brutalizes men, crushes the sweetness
  out of womanhood and the joy out of childhood. It is this that makes lives
  that might be a blessing a pain and a curse, and every year drives more and
  more to seek unbidden refuge in the gates of death. For, a permanent tendency
  to inequality once set up, all the forces of progress tend to greater and greater
  inequality.&nbsp; ... <a

    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 5: The Basic
    Cause of Poverty</a> (in the unabridged: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Book
    V: The Problem Solved</a>) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
      That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
      <em><strong>to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command
      all the fruits of labor save enough to enable labor to exist.</strong></em> ...</p>
  <p>The great cause of inequality in the distribution of wealth is inequality
      in the ownership of land. The ownership of land is the great fundamental
    fact which ultimately determines the social, the political, and consequently
    the
      intellectual and moral condition of a people. And it must be so. For land
    is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which he must draw for all
    his needs,
      the material to which his labor must be applied for the supply of all his
    desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken, the light of the
    sun enjoyed,
      or any of the forces of nature utilized, without the use of land or its
    products. On the land we are born, from it we live, to it we return again &#8212; children
      of the soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower of the field.
    Take away from man all that belongs to land, and he is but a disembodied
    spirit.
      Material progress cannot rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but
    add to the power of producing wealth from land; and hence, when land is monopolized,
      it might go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving the condition
      of those who have but their labor. It can but add to the value of land
    and
      the power which its possession gives. Everywhere, in all times, among all
    peoples, the possession of land is the base of aristocracy, the foundation
    of great
      fortunes, the source of power. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WHEREVER land has an exchange value there is rent in the economic meaning
    of the term. Wherever land having a value is used, either by owner or hirer,
    there is rent actual; wherever it is not used, but still has a value, there
    is rent potential. It is this capacity of yielding rent which gives value
    to land. . . . No matter what are its capabilities, land can yield no rent
    and have no value until some one is willing to give labor or the results
    of labor for the privilege of using it; and what anyone will thus give, depends
    not upon the capacity of the land, but upon its capacity as compared with
    that of land that can be had for nothing. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html"> Book

STATED reversely, the law of rent is necessarily the law of wages and interest
taken together, for it is the assertion, that no matter what be the production
which results from the application of labor and capital, these two factors will
only receive in wages and interest such part of the produce as they could have
produced on land free to them without the payment of rent &#8212; that is the
least productive land or point in use. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html"> Book

<blockquote>
  <p><small>Picture an unpopulated island where we're going to produce one good,
        corn, and there are eleven grades of land. On the best land, we can grow
        ten bushels of corn per week; the second land grows nine bushels, and so
        on to the worst land that grows zero bushels. We'll ignore capital goods
        at first. The first settlers go the best land. While there is free ten-bushel
        land, rent is zero, so wages are 10. When the 10-bushel land is all settled,
        immigrants go to the 9-bushel
    land. </small> </p>
  <p><small> Wages in the 9-bushel land equal 9 while free land is available. What
        then are wages in the 10-bushel land? They must also be 9, since labor is
        mobile. If you offer less, nobody will come, and if you offer a bit more
        than 9, everybody in the 9-bushel land will want to work for you. Competition
        among workers makes wages the same all over (we assume all workers are alike).
        So that extra bushel in the 10-bushel land, after paying 9 for labor, is
        rent. </small></p>
  <p><small> That border line where the best free land is being settled is called
        the "margin of production." When the margin moves to the 8-bushel land, wages
        drop to 8. Rent is now 1 on the 9-bushel land and 2 on the 10-bushel land.
        Do you see what the trend is?<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> As the margin moves to less productive lands, wages
        are going down and rent is going up. We can also now see that wages are determined
        at the margin of production. That is the "law of wages." The wage at the
        margin sets the wage for all lands.</span> The production in the better lands
        left after paying wages goes to rent. That is the "law of rent." If you understand
        the law of wages and the law of rent, you see the cat! To complete our cat
        story, suppose folks can get land to rent and sell for higher prices later
        rather than using it now. This land speculation will hog up lands and make
        the margin move further out than without speculation, lowering wages and
        raising rent even more. </small></p>
  <p><small> Now we have good news and bad news. The good news is that when we
        put in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">capital goods</span> we
        first left out from the example above, the tools and technology increase
        the productivity of all the lands. If production doubles, rent doubles, and
        wages go up. Wages won't double, because workers have to pay for the tools,
        but even if wages go up 50 percent, that's good news, and why industrialized
        economies have a high standard of living. Also, high skills enable educated
        workers to have a wage premium above the basic wage level. The bad news is
        that the technology enables us to extend the margin to less productive land,
        which lowers wages again. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">So there is this constant race between technology
        raising wages and lower margins reducing wages.&nbsp; </span>...</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span> <small><a href="../docs/Foldvary_StC.html"><span
