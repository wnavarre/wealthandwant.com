  Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics  </a> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Lastly, one must appreciate that the market
    value of &#8220;land&#8221; of every sort is entirely rent, as there is no
    human factor of labor that accounts for its origination. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Services
    of nature have no prior cost to bring them into production existence &#8212; the
    electromagnetic spectrum, for example, exists regardless of human presence
    on earth and so presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy
    metals are all found in nature, not the result of human creation. They are,
    in 19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor
    but of God&#8217;s. </span>And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative
    on earth &#8212; the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as
    much as it was their role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of
    the land. That bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements,
    was an equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of
    rent collection and the exploitation of land without recognition of its price.
    The practice effectively ended with what in Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure
    movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign, driving the peasants off the land
    into cities to provide cheap labor for the early English industrialists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But the theory
    continued long afterwards. Georgists today argue that land rent should be
    collected from titleholders so that it is not left to render economic distortions.
    This in turn affects the price of labor and the price of money. Government&#8217;s
    role, whatever else it does, is at the very least responsible for defending
    the commons, to ascertain titles and to collect rent. Although there are
    many differences about the proper role, scope and domain of government among
    Georgist adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
    is central to its tenets. ...</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>So also in the case of the auctioning of &#8220;pollution credits&#8221; or
  tradeable permits, what in fact constitute the right of power industries to
  treat the air as a dump to the full extent which environmental tolerances allow.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span></small> These &#8220;credits&#8221; are
  now &#8220;owned&#8221; by the private sector and traded back and forth among
  corporations, even though all people experience the consequences of its treatment.
  Airport landing slots, &#8220;prime time&#8221; broadcasting, and many other
  time-sensitive dimensions have all been handed over to the private sector with
  nominal benefit to the public. London Mayor Ken Livingstone has been a strong
  supporter of renting the landing slots at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports, and
  is at this very time exploring a rent recovery scheme to pay for the upgrade
  of components of the Jubilee tube line.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">46</span></small>...</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>A Georgist agenda also calls for the regular auctioning of mineral extraction
  rights, fishing rights, and other access to natural resources in a way that
  their rent is returned fully and fairly to the public weal.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">73</span><a
 href="../auth/Hartzok.html">Alanna Hartzok</a> has offered compelling arguments
  why rent from locational sites should be reserved to finance the services of
  local governments, rent from natural resources identifiable within a nation&#8217;s
  boundaries should be captured to finance national governments, and rents of
  those resources beyond national borders should be used to finance world governments.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">74</span></small></small><br>
  <small><small></small></small><br>
  <small>Pricing resources of nature at their marginal rates is a clearly understood
  economic principle. To do otherwise fosters extravagant and wasteful use of
  such, or leads to inefficient use of their locations. Hence both a moral reason &#8212; the
  unjust windfall gain that otherwise befalls such monopoly titles &#8212; and
  an economic reason &#8212; efficiency &#8212; call for such practices. It is
  the compelling impetus of politics and not economic rationality that frustrates
  the implementation of such designs. With the advent of greater and more accurate
  data, as well as the increased power of computer analysis, there is every reason
  to argue for and anticipate the collection of economic rent from every source
  where it arises.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>A central premise of ecological economics is a recognition that market
  prices do not reflect the value of commodities, particularly the resources
  and services of nature. Oscar Wilde first noted&nbsp;that a cynic was &#8220;a
  man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.&#8221; <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">83</span></small> But
  it is clearly not only cynics who hold such ideas today. The growing &#8220;commodification&#8221; of
  all things &#8212; the consequence of a gradual and inexorable privatization
  of the whole world and the ever expanding attempts to include everything which
  humans touch in a market economy, where objects and services which lack a market
  price are thus treated as free goods &#8212; means either that ultimately everything
  must be priced or else that other means must be found by which to identify
  value. The subfield of environmental economics is based on just this view &#8212; that
  everything must be priced. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To be sure, we
  cannot live without the natural environment, yet treatment of natural goods
  and services as free under the neoclassical economics framework leads inevitably
  to their total consumption and destruction</span>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">84</span></small> The looming
  exhaustion of natural resources compels us to recognize that market prices
  have limited worth in signaling true value, whether those resources be the
  biota of the world upon which human beings also depend for their existence
  or mineral wealth in the form of fossil fuel energy which drives modern economies.
  If we do try in any way to price the goods and services provided by the environment,
  they are so far beyond counting that it becomes self-evident that our economic
  approach must change.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">85
  ...</span></small></small><br>
  <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
  <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>The
  heart of ecological economics is ecological carrying capacity and the premise
  of economic sustainability. Although this term has to some extent become a
  mantra and widely abused, its most popular definition remains that first enunciated
  by the 1987 Brundtland Commission Report:<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> "development that meets the needs of the present
  without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">92</span></small> Principle 3
  of the 1992 UNCED Rio Declaration: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"The right to development must be fulfilled so as
  to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future
  generations."</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">93</span></small> At various
  times scholars have sought to improve upon this definition; one offered by
  adherents of the ecological economics school reads as follows:</small><br>
  Competitively assessed royalties especially on the extraction of mineral capital
  could yield billions of dollars. </div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1. For renewable resources (fish, trees,
    etc.), the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration. </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>2. The rate at which we allow economic
    activity to generate wastes that must be passed into the environment should
    not be allowed to exceed the environment&#8217;s ability to absorb them. </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>3. The depletion of nonrenewable resources
    (oil, coal, etc.) should not be offset by investment in and development of
    renewable substitutes for them.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">94 ...</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
    <small>Living within the laws of nature would seem to be axiomatic in the
    development of any ethical system, and it is a mark of degree that our ethics
    have so ignored such realities that a corrective is called for. Only in 1967
    Professor Lynn White noted in a now famous article how much the Judeo-Christian
    tradition has been used to explain and justify practices of exploitation
    and domination of our natural environment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">99</span></small><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Sand County Almanac</span>, a work only published
    in 1949!<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">100</span></small> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ecological
    economists accept this so much as given &#8212; that human beings are <span
 style="font-style: italic;">of</span> the earth and its bio-system rather than
    on the earth to dominate it&#8212; that further refinement of this basic
    orientation is almost beside the point. This was simply prudent care and
    planning to Leopold; he fully recognized our total dependence upon nature.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
  <small>Not only are human beings co-equal with other living beings of the earth,
  so also are beings yet born entitled to an existence. The Iroquois Indians
  of New York State are often quoted to the effect that &#8220;In our every deliberation,
  we should consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations.&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">101</span></small> Several contemporary
  environmental organizations have adopted the Iroquois &#8220;Great Law of Peace&#8221; so
  that it has become the vernacular equivalent of the Brundtland Report&#8217;s
  definition of sustainability. Sustainable economics, or 7th generation planning,
  also requires Daly&#8217;s &#8220;steady state&#8221; economy, <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">102</span></small> where (as
  if natural resources constitute &#8220;capital&#8221;) one lives only on interest
  and not principle. Daly contrasts two notions of economic practice: growth
  and development. The former may momentarily increase economic productivity
  and wealth, but is in the long term a fatal course of policy. It increases
  quantity but not quality. Development, rather, is what should be aspired to,
  an increase in quality, efficiency, and fulfillment through minimal uses of
  energy and material resources. For development, the value-added dimension comes
  from treading lightly on the earth, from the use of mental capital rather than
  physical capital.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">103</span></small> Daly in still
  another article talks about three parameters of sustainability: &#8220;allocation,
  distribution, and scale,&#8221; which will lead to an economy which is &#8220;efficient,
  just and sustainable.&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">104 </span></small></small><br>
  <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
  <small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>One
  exponent of ecological economics suggests five axioms to measure the degree
  of &#8220;ecosystem health:&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">105</span></small></small><br>
  <small><small></small></small> Mistaken or not, this view of man&#8217;s place
  in nature is generally accepted as conventional wisdom throughout western culture.
  The ecology movement constitutes a revolutionary and very unsettling outlook
  to this prevailing view, a radical shift in thinking from even mainstream environmentalism
  and conservation ethics half a century ago. In this view other species, both
  plants and animals, are as much entitled to life and well being as is homo
  sapiens. Theodore Roosevelt a century ago could never have subscribed to the
  views of contemporary environmental ethicists, as much of a conservationist
  as he was. The earliest clear manifestation of modern thinking at least in
  western thought appears to be Aldo Leopold&#8217;s </div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The Axiom of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamism</span>: Nature
      is more profoundly a set of processes than a collection of objects; all
      is in flux. Ecosystems develop and age over time.</small></li>
  <li><small>The Axiom of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Relatedness</span>:
      All processes are related to all other processes.</small></li>
  <li><small>The Axiom of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hierarchy</span>:
      Processes are not related equally but unfold in systems within systems,
      differing mainly along the temporal and spatial scale on which they are
      organized.</small></li>
  <li><small>The Axiom of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Creativity</span>:
      The autonomous processes of nature are creative and represent the basis
      for all biologically based productivity. The vehicle of that creativity
      is energy flowing through systems which in turn find stable contexts in
      larger systems, which provide sufficient stability to allow self-organization
      within them through repetition and duplication.</small></li>
  <li><small>The Axiom of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Differential Fragility</span>:
      Ecological systems, which form the context of all human activities, vary
      in the extent to which they can absorb and equilibrate human-caused disruptions
      in their autonomous processes.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><small>Elsewhere ecosystems are measured according to their relative
        health, a metaphor deliberately taken from the field of medicine. What
        constitutes ecosystem health is still very much an open discussion, but
        it has been defined in terms such as integrity,<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">106</span></small> diversity,
        stability and resiliency.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">107</span></small> These are
        all concepts which presume a level of depth, span and integration, and
        see the living environment not as things and instruments, but rather
        as elements of interdependent processes requiring respect, sometimes
        even management. It often also presumes respect for the environment not
        just for instrumental reasons but for aesthetic and moral reasons. The
        reality of ecological economics entails valuation of nature according
        to criteria beyond just market value. After all, this nature is a central
        part of the &#8220;commons&#8221; or &#8220;natural capital.&#8221;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; ... </span><a

    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
    that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
    to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use in an urban context
    is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who gets the principal
    benefits from urban economic growth. Its ownership is a major determinant
    of the degree of economic inequality: surges of land prices, such as have
    occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions
    of wealth.<strong> In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and
    nature more generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological
    sustainability. Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing affordability
    and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the land

<p>Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html">A Clarion Call to Sanity, to Honesty, to Justice</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Our problem today, as yesterday, and the days before, back to the earliest
    recorded times, is POVERTY.</p>
  <p>There are times when this problem is lesser. We call these "booms." There
    are also times when the problem is greatly exacerbated. These are called "busts." But,
    as the Bible says, "the poor have ye always with ye."</p>
  <p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the core of the problem. It is not
    the position that there is only one single error afoot in our social organizations.
    There may be several, there may be only a few things to remedy. The position
    is, as stated earlier, that there is one basic cause of the problem. Therefore,
    the removal of this one basic error is the first, the primary step, for the
    simple reason that, until this basic social evil is eradicated, no other reform
    will avail. We will simply continue the boom and bust cycles until the economies
    of the whole world are wrecked by inflation or by a nuclear war triggered by
    the ongoing economic disaster.</p>
  <p>Let us begin this study of the likely causes of our troubles by asking two
    questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are we over-populated? </li>
    <li>Are the earth's resources inadequate for this population? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>  Our stage, of course, for making this study will be this world of ours, for it
    is upon this world that the drama of human living is played out, with all its
    joys and all its sorrows, with all its great achievements and all its failures,
    with all its nobilities and all its wickedness.
  </p>
  <p>Regardless of its size relative to other planets, with its circumference of
    about twenty-five thousand miles, to any mere mortal who must walk to the station
    and back each day, it is huge. Roughly ninety-six million miles separate the
    sun from the earth on the latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this
    distance, the earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and it
    spins on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's rays are distributed
    far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage and maximizing their benefits.</p>
  <p><strong>Consider the complementarity of nature in the case of the two forms of life
    we call vegetable and animal, in their respective uses of the two gases, oxygen
    and carbon dioxide, the waste product of each serving as the life-giving force
    of the other. Any increase in the one will encourage a like response in the
    other.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Marvel at the manner in which nature, with no help from man or beast, delivers
    pure water to the highest lands, increasing it as to their elevation, thus
    affording us a free ride downstream and free power as we desire it. Look with
    awe at the variety and quantity of minerals with which this world is blessed,
    and finally at the fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both
    animal and vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels from a single
    stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of this year's crop;
    then think of the vastly greater yields from a single cherry pit or the seeds
    of a single apple, or grape or watermelon; or, turning to the animal world,
    consider the hen who averages almost an egg a day and the spawning fish as
    examples of the prolificacy that is evident throughout the whole of the animal
    world, including mankind.</strong></p>
  <p>If this marvelous earth is as rich in resources as portrayed in the foregoing
    paragraph, then the problem must be one of distribution:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>how is the land distributed among the earth's inhabitants, and </li>
    <li>how are its products in turn distributed?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>  Land is universally treated as either public property or private property. Wars
    are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated as common
    property.
  </p>
  <p>George has described this world as a "well-provisioned ship" and when one
    considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals of such provisions as coal
    and petroleum as have occurred say over the past one hundred years, one must
    but agree with this writer. But this is only a static view. Consider the
    suggestion of some ten years ago that it would require the conversion of
    less than 20%
    the of the current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the motors
    then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The dynamic picture of
    the future is indeed awesome, and there is every indication that that characteristic
    has the potential of endless expansion. <b>So how is it that on so richly endowed
    a Garden of Eden as this world of ours we have only been able to make of it
    a hell on earth for vast numbers of people?</b></p>
  <p>The answers are simple: we have permitted, nay we have even more than that,
    encouraged, the gross misallocation of resources and a viciously wicked distribution

<blockquote>
  <p>    I&#8217;m a businessman. I believe society should reward successful initiative
    with profit. At the same time, I know that profit-seeking activities have
    unhealthy side effects. They cause pollution, waste, inequality, anxiety,
    and no small amount of confusion about the purpose of life.</p>
  <p>I&#8217;m also a liberal, in the sense that I&#8217;m not averse to a role
    for government in society. Yet history has convinced me that representative
    government can&#8217;t adequately protect the interests of ordinary citizens.
    Even less can it protect the interests of future generations, <strong>ecosystems</strong>,
    and nonhuman species. The reason is that most &#8212; though not all &#8212; of
    the time, government puts the interests of private corporations first. This
    is a systemic problem of a capitalist democracy, not just a matter of electing
    new leaders.</p>
  <p>If you identify with the preceding sentiments, then you might be confused
    and demoralized, as I have been lately. If capitalism as we know it is deeply
    flawed, and government is no savior, where lies hope? This strikes me as
    one of the great dilemmas of our time. For years the Right has been saying &#8212; nay,
    shouting &#8212; that government is flawed and that only privatization, deregulation,
    and tax cuts can save us. For just as long, the Left has been insisting that
    markets are flawed and that only government can save us. The trouble is that
    both sides are half-right and half-wrong. They&#8217;re both right that markets
    and state are flawed, and both wrong that salvation lies in either sphere.
    But if that&#8217;s the case, what are we to do? Is there, perhaps, a missing
    set of institutions that can help us? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Part 2 proposes a number of new property rights, birthrights, and institutions
    that would enlarge the commons sector in one way or another. I like to think
    that these proposals blend hope and realism. Among them are:</p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> A series of <strong>ecosystem trusts</strong> that protect air, water, forests and
        habitat;</li>
      <li> A mutual fund that pays dividends to all Americans &#8212; one person,
                one share;</li>
      <li> A trust fund that provides start-up capital to every child;</li>
      <li> A risk-sharing pool for health care that covers everyone;</li>
      <li> A national fund based on copyright fees that supports local arts;</li>
      <li> A limit on the amount of advertising. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider also what scientists call biodiversity. The earth is a tiny island
    of life in a cold, dark universe. We humans share this magical island with
    millions of other species, most of whom we haven&#8217;t met. Each of these
    species fills a niche and contributes to the web of life. Yet little by little,
    we&#8217;re pushing the others out of their living spaces. The result is
    a wave of extinctions comparable to that which wiped out the dinosaurs sixty-five
    million years ago. The difference is that, while the dinosaurs&#8217; extinction
    was triggered by a freak event, the current extinctions are being caused
    by our everyday activities.</p>
  <p>And it&#8217;s not just other species we&#8217;re endangering. As anthropologists
    Jared Diamond and Ronald Wright recently reminded us, past human civilizations
    (Sumer, Rome, the Maya, Easter Island) did on a smaller scale what our own
    economic system seems bent on doing planet-wide: they destroyed their resource
    bases and crashed. The pattern is hauntingly familiar. First, the civilization
    finds a formula &#8212; agriculture, irrigation, fishing, capitalism &#8212; for
    extracting value from ecosystems. Because the formula works so well, the
    civilization&#8217;s leaders become blindly attached to it. Eventually, the
    key resources on which the formula depends become depleted and the inflexible
    civilization collapses like a house of cards. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Similarly, in the early capitalist era, land, resources, and places to dump
    wastes were abundant; aggregated capital was the scarcest factor. That&#8217;s
    why rules and practices developed that put capital above all else. In the
    twenty-first century, however, this is no longer the case. As economist Joshua
    Farley has noted, &#8220;If we want more fish on our dinner plates, the scarce
    factor isn&#8217;t fishing boats, it&#8217;s fish. If we want more timber,
    the scarce factor isn&#8217;t sawmills, it&#8217;s trees.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As a businessman and investor, I&#8217;ve benefited personally from the
    primacy of capital and am not keen to end it. But as a citizen, I have to
    recognize that times have changed. The world is awash with capital, most
    of it devoted to speculation. By contrast, healthy ecosystems are increasingly
    scarce. If anything deserves priority, it&#8217;s nature&#8217;s capital,
    yet capitalism rolls on with financial capital as its king. ...</p>
  <p>DESTRUCTION OF NATURE</p>
  <p>Humans began ravaging nature long before capitalism was a gleam in Adam
    Smith&#8217;s eye. Surplus capitalism, however, has exponentially enlarged
    the scale of that ravaging.</p>
  <p>I promised no grim numbers, but I&#8217;ll cite just one. In 2005, a United
    Nations&#8211;sponsored research team reported that roughly 60 percent of
    the ecosystems that support life on earth are being used unsustainably. Such
    overuse, reported the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, increases the likelihood
    that abrupt, nonlinear changes will seriously affect human well-being. The
    potential consequences include floods, droughts, heat waves, fishery collapse,
    dead zones along coasts, sea level rises, and new diseases.</p>
  <p>Thoughtful people can debate whether population or technology is more responsible
    than capitalism for our loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. No doubt all
    play a role. But most of the damage isn&#8217;t done by the numerous poor;
    it&#8217;s done by the far fewer rich. The United States, for example, with
    5 percent of the world&#8217;s people, has dumped nearly 30 percent of our
    species&#8217; cumulative carbon dioxide wastes into the atmosphere. It&#8217;s
    our excess consumption, rather than the poor&#8217;s meager gleanings, that&#8217;s
    the larger problem, and surplus capitalism is the handmaiden of that excess.</p>
  <p>Technology, of course, greatly magnifies our impact on the planet, but technology
    by itself is mere know-how. It&#8217;s the choice of technologies, and the
    scale at which they&#8217;re deployed, that affects the planet. Electricity,
    for example, can be generated in many ways. When corporations choose among
    them, however, their choice is driven not by &#8220;least harm to nature,&#8221; but
    by &#8220;most bang for the buck.&#8221; And, in doing their calculations,
    they count the cost of nature as zero. Hence we have lots of fossil-fuel
    burning and little use of solar, wind, and tidal energy.</p>
  <p>The same calculus drives corporations&#8217; approach to agriculture, logging,
    and many other activities. The result is at once humbling and chilling: capitalism
    as we know it is devouring creation. It&#8217;s living off nature&#8217;s
    capital and calling it growth. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>There&#8217;s even an economic theory explaining this: Mancur Olson&#8217;s
    logic of collective action. Olson, a Harvard economist, argued that unless
    the number of players in a group is very small, people won&#8217;t combine
    to pursue their common interests. For example, if the CEOs of five major
    airlines decide they want a $500 million government bailout, they pool their
    resources and hire a lobbying firm. Together they tell Congress that without
    the $500 million, their companies won&#8217;t survive, and the consequences
    of their collapse will be dire.</p>
  <p>Who lobbies against them? No one. The reason is that, while the five airlines
    will gain about $100 million each, the average taxpayer will lose only $5
    each. It&#8217;s thus not worth it for ordinary citizens to get off their
    duffs and fight.</p>
  <p>On top of this, there&#8217;s an even deeper problem. Democracy responds
    at best to voters and at worst to money. Both voters and donors are living
    humans. Not even seated at democracy&#8217;s table &#8212; not organized,
    not propertied, and not enfranchised &#8212; are future generations, ecosystems,
    and nonhuman species. James Madison and his brethren could scarcely have
    foreseen this defect. In their day, politics was about the clash between
    living factions, not between living humans and their heirs, or between our
    species and the rest of nature. But that&#8217;s no longer the case.</p>
  <p>The implications of Adam Smith&#8217;s quote at the beginning of this chapter
    are thus even graver than he thought. If government&#8217;s inherent bias
    is toward property owners, the losers aren&#8217;t only the poor. The losers
    are also future generations, ecosystems, and nonhuman species, none of whom
    own any property at all. The only positive news here is that the converse
    might also be true: if future generations, ecosystems, and nonhuman species
    did own property, they might have some economic and political power. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 4: The Limits of Privatization (pages 49-63)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s tempting to believe that private owners, by pursuing their own
    self-interest, can preserve shared inheritances. No one likes being told
    what to do, and words like <em>statism</em> conjure fears of bureaucracy at best and
    tyranny at worst. By contrast, <em>privatism</em> connotes freedom.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we look at Garrett Hardin&#8217;s second alternative for
    saving the commons: privatism, or privatization. I argue that private corporations,
    operating in unconstrained markets, can allocate resources efficiently but
    can&#8217;t preserve them. The latter task requires setting aside some supplies
    for future generations &#8212; something neither markets nor corporations,
    when left to their own devices, will do. The reason lies in the algorithms
    and starting conditions of our current operating system.</p>
  <p>The Algorithms of Capitalism 2.0</p>
  <p>If you&#8217;ve ever used a computer spreadsheet, you know what an algorithm
    is. Each cell in the spreadsheet contains a set of instructions: take data
    from other cells, manipulate the data according to a formula, and display
    the result. The instructions within each cell are algorithms.</p>
  <p>If you think of the economy as a huge spreadsheet, with each cell representing
    a producer, consumer, or property owner, you can see that the behavior of
    the whole is driven by the algorithms in the cells. Our current operating
    system is dominated by three algorithms and one starting condition. The algorithms
    are:<br>
    (1) maximize return to capital,<br>
    (2) distribute property income on a per-share basis, and<br>
    <strong>(3) the price of nature equals zero.</strong><br>
    The starting condition is that the top 5 percent of the people own more property
    shares than the remaining 95 percent.</p>
  <p>The first algorithm is what drives corporations. It tells them to sell as
    much as they can, pay as little as possible for labor, resources, and waste
    disposal, and make shareholders happy every quarter. It focuses the minds
    of managers every day. If they work in marketing, they wake up thinking about
    how to sell more; if there&#8217;s no demand for their product, they must
    create some. If they work in finance, they worry about margins and leverage.
    If they&#8217;re in labor relations, they bargain hard, replace long-term
    employees with temps, and shift jobs to places where wages are lower. All
    the while, the CEO feeds sweet numbers to Wall Street.</p>
  <p>The second and third algorithms then mesh with the first. It&#8217;s the
    combination of these algorithms that causes the wheels of capitalism to devour
    nature and widen inequality among humans. At the same time, nothing in the
    algorithms requires or encourages corporations, either individually or collectively,
    to preserve anything.</p>
  <p>This doesn&#8217;t mean people inside corporations don&#8217;t think about
    protecting nature, raising their workers&#8217; pay, or giving something
    back to society. Often, they do. It does mean their room for actually doing
    such things is too narrow to make a difference. Nor does it mean that, from
    time to time, some brave mavericks don&#8217;t briefly flout the corporate
    algorithm. They do that, too. What I&#8217;m saying is that, in the great
    majority of cases, the corporate algorithm and its brethren are obeyed. <strong>For
    all practical purposes, the publicly traded corporation is a slave to its
    algorithm. </strong>... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>Natural Assets<br>
    In 2002, economists Robert Costanza and Paul Sutton estimated the contribution
      of ecosystem services to the U.S. economy at $2 trillion. Ecosystem services
      represent the benefits humans derive from natural ecosystems, including
      food from wild plants and animals, climate regulation, waste assimilation,
      fresh water replenishment, soil formation, nutrient cycling, flood control,
      pollination, raw materials, and more. Using data from many previous studies,
      as well as satellite photography, Costanza and Sutton estimated values
      for ecosystems per unit of biome (an acre of rain forest, or grasslands,
      or desert, for example). They then multiplied by the total area of each
      biome and summed over all services and biomes.</p>
  <p>If $2 trillion represents the yearly contribution of nature to the U.S.
    economy, what&#8217;s the underlying value of America&#8217;s natural assets?
    One way to answer this is to treat yearly ecosystem services as &#8220;earnings&#8221; produced
    by &#8220;stocks&#8221;of natural assets.These earnings can then be multiplied
    by the average price/earnings ratio of publicly traded stocks over the last
    fifty years (16.5/1) to arrive at an estimated natural asset value of $33
    trillion.</p>
  <p>This figure is, if anything, an underestimate, because it ignores a singular
    aspect of nature: its irreplaceability. If Corporation X were to go out of
    business, its useful contributions to society would quickly be supplied by
    another corporation.</p>
  <p>If a natural ecosystem were to disappear, however, it could not so easily
    be replaced. Thus, an irreplaceability premium of indeterminate magnitude
    should be added to the $33 trillion. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>A Second Set of Books</p>
  <p>Mental models begin with assumptions. Most economists today assume there
    are only two kinds of property, private (that is, corporate or individual)
    and state. There are no shared assets, no inter- or intragenerational obligations,
    and no nonhumans other than those we eat.</p>
  <p>Yet as we&#8217;ve seen, many things are missing here. The most obvious
    omission is the great economy of nature within which the human enterprise
    operates. We&#8217;re borrowing prodigiously from that economy, but not recording
    the loans. Equally absent are future generations, from whom we&#8217;re borrowing
    just as wantonly and surreptitiously. In a proper bookkeeping system, every
    loan shows up on two balance sheets, the borrower&#8217;s and the lender&#8217;s.
    One entity&#8217;s liability is another entity&#8217;s asset. But this isn&#8217;t
    true in contemporary economics. When the human economy grows, assets on corporate
    and individual balance sheets go up, but nowhere is there a debit. In fact,
    there aren&#8217;t any accounts that could be debited. There&#8217;s only
    good growth on one side of the ledger, and on the other, a void in which
    illth and debt accumulate, uncounted and unnoticed.</p>
  <p>In recent years, economists have added a few bits to this stripped-down
    model. For example, they now recognize public goods and ecosystem services
    as contributors of economic value. Public goods are services like national
    defense, education, and flood control, which benefit everyone but can&#8217;t
    easily be sold at a profit. Because markets don&#8217;t adequately supply
    them, governments step in and do so. Economists sometimes debate whether
    the value of these public goods exceeds the &#8220;burden&#8221; they impose
    on taxpayers, but they don&#8217;t see the expenditures as adding value to
    any account, or to any asset owned by anyone.</p>
  <p>Similarly, many economists now recognize ecosystem services as valuable
    inputs to the economy. However, the ecosystems that produce these services
    have no owners or balance sheets. They&#8217;re just there, floating in space,
    with no connection to humans. What I&#8217;m suggesting is that economists
    treat them as if they were common property held in trust. This simple supposition
    would not only put ecosystems on the books, enabling us to track them better;
    it would also pave the way to real-world property rights that actually protect
    those ecosystems. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

  <p> THAT man cannot exhaust or lessen the powers of nature follows from the
    indestructibility of matter and the persistence of force. Production and
    consumption are only relative terms. Speaking absolutely, man neither produces
    nor consumes. The whole human race, were they to labor to infinity, could
    not make this rolling sphere one atom heavier or one atom lighter, could
    not add to or diminish by one iota the sum of the forces whose everlasting
    circling produces all motion and sustains all life. As the water that we
    take from the ocean must again return to the ocean, so the food we take from
    the reservoirs of nature is, from the moment we take it, on its way back
    to those reservoirs. What we draw from a limited extent of land may temporarily
    reduce the productiveness of that land, because the return may be to other
    land, or may be divided between that land and other land, or perhaps, all
    land ; but this possibility lessens with increasing area, and ceases when
    the whole globe is considered. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book
    II, Chapter 3: Population and Subsistence: Inferences from Analogy</p>
  <p>LIFE does not use up the forces that maintain life. We come into the material
    universe bringing nothing; we take nothing away when we depart. The human
    being, physically considered, is but a transient form of matter, a changing
    mode of motion. The matter remains and the force persists. Nothing is lessened,
    nothing is weakened. And from this it follows that the limit to the population
    of the globe can only be the limit of space. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book

    DOES not the fact that all of the things which furnish man's subsistence
      have the power to multiply many fold &#8212; some of them many thousand
      fold, and some of them many million or even billion fold &#8212; while
      he is only doubling his numbers, show that, let human beings increase to
      the full extent of their reproductive power, the increase of population
      can never exceed subsistence? This is clear when it is remembered that
      though in the vegetable and animal kingdoms each species, by virtue of
      its reproductive power, naturally and necessarily presses against the conditions
      which limit its further increase, yet these conditions are nowhere fixed
      and final. No species reaches the ultimate limit of soil, water, air, and
      sunshine; but the actual limit of each is in the existence of other species,
      its rivals, its enemies, or its food. Thus the conditions which limit the
      existence of such of these species as afford him subsistence man can extend
      (in some cases his mere appearance will extend them), and thus the reproductive
      forces of the species which supply his wants, instead of wasting themselves
      against their former limit, start forward in his service at a pace which
      his powers of increase cannot rival. If he but shoot hawks, food-birds
      will increase: if he but trap foxes the wild rabbits will multiply; the
      bumble bee moves with the pioneer, and on the organic matter with which
      man's presence fills the rivers, fishes feed. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book

  <p>IF bears instead of men had been shipped from Europe to the North American
    continent, there would now be no more bears than in the time of Columbus,
    and possibly fewer, for bear food would not have been increased nor the conditions
    of bear life extended, by the bear immigration, but probably the reverse.
    But within the limits of the United States alone, there are now forty-five
    millions of men where then there were only a few hundred thousand, and yet
    there is now within that territory much more food per capita for the forty-five
    millions than there was then for the few hundred thousand. It is not the
    increase of food that has caused this increase of men; but the increase of
    men that has brought about the increase of food. There is more food, simply
    because there are more Man. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book II,
    Chapter 3: Population and Subsistence: Inferences from Analogy</p>
  <p>TWENTY men working together will, where nature is niggardly, produce more
    than twenty times the wealth that one man can produce where nature is most
    bountiful. The denser the population the more minute becomes the subdivision
    of labor, the greater the economies of production and distribution, and,
    hence, the very reverse of the Malthusian doctrine is true; and, within the
    limits in which we have any reason to suppose increase would still go on,
    in any given state of civilization a greater number of people can produce
    a larger proportionate amount of wealth and more fully supply their wants,
    than can a smaller number. &#8212; Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212; Book II,
