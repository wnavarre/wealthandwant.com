<blockquote>
  <p>We are in the habit of thinking of land and buildings together as &quot;real
    estate&quot;
      and forgetting to notice that land and buildings are fundamentally different.
      Buildings depreciate, every year. The land was there before we were born,
      and will be there long after we're gone, while buildings come and go. Land
      appreciates,
      as
      a result
      of our
      common investment in services and infrastructure; as a result of population
      increase,
      as a result of technological innovations (e.g., think of the impact of
      air conditioning and fiberglass boats on land prices in the American south)
      and
      as a result of the natural amenities in the area. None
      of these
      are something any
      of us
      can
      rightly
      take
      credit
      for,
      or
      claim
      rightly
      as our
      <em>private</em>  treasure.
      Materials for buildings are readily available and one can be substituted
      for another; nothing can be substituted for land! When demand for buildings
      increases,
      so can  the supply of building materials. But land is different, and when
      demand rises, as it must if population increases, its value increases because
      its
      supply is fixed.</p>
  <p>Should some of us be permitted to grow wealthy on this, or treat it as our
      private piggy bank, while others (our landless, our young, our commuters,
    to name just three groups) have to pay the fortunate ones who privatize the
    economic
      value of land? This is privilege at its worst, and the ripple effects throughout
      American society (as in every other society &#8212; think of the places
      and ways we provide foreign aid, and how little effect it has on the lives
      of the poor, but how much the powerful appreciate it) are far-reaching
      and devastating.</p>
  <p>The alternative, of course, is to tax land value, to treat it as our <em><strong>common</strong></em>      treasure, to be collected to support spending on the common good. The positive
      effects of this are as positive as the ripple effects of privilege are devastating.
      This is <a href="The_Remedy.html">the remedy</a> of which Henry George
      wrote and spoke. Our American ancestors ended chattel slavery. Can we make
      <em><strong>our</strong></em> generation
      the one that brings awareness and an end to something equally cruel and
      devastating &#8212; and
      far more widespread?</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An acquaintance of mine died in
San Francisco recently,
leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in
England. I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more
temperate than he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This
man did not get his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He
no more produced it than did those lucky relations in England who may
now do nothing for the rest of their lives. He became rich by getting
hold of a piece of land in the early days, which, as San Francisco
grew, became very valuable. His wealth represented not what he had
earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of the earth's surface
enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the
other day, leaving $3,000,000.
He may or may not have been particularly industrious, skilful and
economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that he got
so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby
through a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against
the pauper labor of Europe," gave him the advantage of a
sixty-per-cent, tariff. To the day of his death he was a stanch
protectionist, and said free trade would ruin our "infant
industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to lay by
from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by
the tariff that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's
earnings.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element of monopoly, of
appropriation and spoliation
will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account for
all great fortunes....</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt
fortune. The first Vanderbilt was a
boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it. But it was not
working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money
enough he used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He
ran off opposition lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel.
Then he went into railroads, pursuing the same tactics. The
Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working and saving than did the
fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune.
Mr. Gould might have got his
first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial. But
it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions.
It was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures,
getting up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock
values and transportation rates. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great
fortunes which the Pacific
railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations
of Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by
monopolizing and gouging. And so of fortunes made by such
combinations as the Standard Oil Company, the Bessemer Steel Ring,
the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and the various rings
for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper labor of
Europe." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of
successful patents. Like that
element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased value of
land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I am
not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make
fortunes out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and,
in fact, through nearly all
acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes, these
elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me
recently, "It is not on our ordinary business that we make our money;
it is where we can get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally
true.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Evils of
Monopolists</b>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Consider the important
part
in building up fortunes which the
increase of land values has had, and is having, in the United States.
This is, of course, monopoly, pure and simple. </span>When land
increases in
value it does not mean that its owner has added to the general
wealth. The owner may never have seen the land or done aught to
improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant city or in
another country. Increase of land values simply means that the
owners, by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed
before man was, have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth
produced by other people's labor. Consider how much the monopolies
created and the advantages given to the unscrupulous by the tariff
and by our system of internal taxation -- how much the railroad (a
business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water and other
similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and
stock-gambling, the destructive use of wealth in driving off or
buying off opposition which the public must finally pay for, and many
other things which these will suggest, have operated to build up
large fortunes, and it will at least appear that the unequal
distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many
who work little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the
earnings of the one class are, in one way or another, filched away
from them to swell the incomes of the other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly
making their way from the
ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the ranks of those
who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state of things
right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that
piracy was right and that no effort should be made to suppress
it.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I am not denouncing the rich,
nor seeking, by speaking of
these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get a clear
understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that it
is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which
we give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by
law and by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so
enormously rich while others remain so miserably poor. If we look
around us and note the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation
which go to the building up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see
on the one hand now disingenuous are those who preach to us that
there is nothing wrong in social relations and that the inequalities
in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities of human
nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk as
though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
restricting the acquisition of wealth. Capital is a good; the
capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely
let any one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in
doing so.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There are deep wrongs in the
present constitution of society,
but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in
those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are
the laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from
bad
adjustments which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social
state is not that in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but
in which each gets in proportion to his contribution to the general
stock. And in such a social state there would not be less incentive
to exertion than now; there would be far more incentive. Men will be
more industrious and more moral, better workmen and better citizens,
if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his family, than
where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them until
some have far more than they could have earned, and others have
little or nothing. &nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought this
      question:</p>
  <p>&quot;Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German
    Ocean a no man's land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should
    be able
      to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and
    of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large a part of
    English
      soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
  <p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
      to thirty shillings a day.</p>
  <p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
      would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall; and
    if he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would happen
    without
      any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural
    opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry being much changed;
    only that kind of
      production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together
      less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in
    wages would be at the expense of rent.</p>
  <p>Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
      has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little
      village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the
      railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light
      of the candle;
      it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously
      multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be
      any higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for
      a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
      on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not
    be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances
    are
      that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold
      possession.&quot;</p>
  <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing
      more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni
      of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole
      in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota
      to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city
      you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an
      almshouse. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>THE poverty to which in advancing civilization great masses of men are condemned,
    is not the freedom from distraction and temptation which sages have sought
    and philosophers have praised: it is a degrading and embruting slavery, that
    cramps the higher nature, dulls the finer feelings, and drives men by its
    pain to acts which the brutes would refuse. It is into this helpless, hopeless
    poverty, that crushes manhood and destroys womanhood, that robs even childhood
    of its innocence and joy, that the working classes are being driven by a
    force which acts upon them like a resistless and unpitying machine. The Boston
    collar manufacturer who pays his girls two cents an hour may commiserate
    their condition, but he, as they, is governed by the law of competition,
    and cannot pay more and carry on his business, for exchange is not governed
    by sentiment. And so, through all intermediate gradations, up to those who
    receive the earnings of labor without return, in the rent of land, it is
    the inexorable laws of supply and demand, a power with which the individual
    can no more quarrel or dispute than with the winds and the tides, that seem
    to press down the lower classes into the slavery of want. <br>
  <br>
But, in reality, the cause is that which always has, and always must result in
slavery &#8212; the monopolization by some of what nature has designed for all.
. . . Private ownership of land is the nether millstone. Material progress is
the upper millstone. Between them; with an increasing pressure, the working classes
are being ground. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp072.html">Progress &amp; Poverty &#8212;</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp072.html"> Book

of private property in land</a></p>
  <p> IT is not in the relations of capital and labor; it is not in the pressure
    of population against subsistence that an explanation of the unequal development
    of our civilization is to be found. The great cause of inequality in the
    distribution of wealth is inequality in the ownership of land. The ownership
    of land is the great fundamental fact which ultimately determines the social,
    the political and, consequently, the intellectual and moral condition of
    a people. And it must be so. For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse
    upon which he must draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor
    must be applied for the supply of all his desires; for even the products
    of the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces
    of nature utilized, without the use of land or its products. On the land
    we are born, from it we live, to it we return again &#8212; children of the
    soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower of the field. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html"> &#8212; Book

    wealth</a><br>
      <br>
  THERE is nothing strange or inexplicable in the phenomena that are now perplexing
  the world. It is not that material progress is not in itself a good, it is
  not that nature has called into being children for whom she has failed to provide;
  it is not that the Creator has left on natural laws a taint of injustice at
  which even the human mind revolts, that material progress brings such bitter
  fruits. That amid our highest civilization men faint and die with want is not
  due to the niggardliness of nature, but to the injustice of man. Vice and misery,
  poverty and pauperism, are not the legitimate results of increase of population
  and industrial development; they only follow increase of population and industrial
  development because land is treated as private property &#8212; they are the
  direct and necessary results of the violation of the supreme law of justice,
  involved in giving to some men the exclusive possession of that which nature
  provides for all men. &#8212;<em> <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we

  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">99. &quot;Whatever dispute arouses the passions of men,
        the conflict is sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it wise?'
        as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an
        ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind; it
        rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably the
        deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that alone
        is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual actions
        and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider
        field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
        material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country have
        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is
        truthfully described in &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch.
        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard
          in search of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without
          paying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink,
          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">105. As Puck once put it, &quot;the man who makes two
        blades of grass to grow where but one grew before, must not be surprised
        when ordered to 'keep off the grass.' &quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent or land
        values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial depression
        is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the relation of cause
        and effect, is obvious to whoever considers the necessary relation between
        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
        much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
        power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive
    power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
    greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals
    suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p><em>Q32. Is not ownership of land necessary to induce its improvement? Does
      not history show that private ownership is a step in advance of common
      ownership?</em><br>
A. No. Private use was doubtless a step in advance of common use. And because
private use seems to us to have been brought about under the institution of private
ownership, private ownership appears to the superficial to have been the real
advance. But a little observation and reflection will remove that impression.
Private ownership of land is not necessary to its private use. And so far from
inducing improvement, private ownership retards it. When a man owns land he may
accumulate wealth by doing nothing with the land, simply allowing the community
to increase its value while he pays a merely nominal tax, upon the plea that
he gets no income from the property. But when the possessor has to pay the value
of his land every year, as he would have to under the single tax, and as ground
renters do now, he must improve his holding in order to profit by it. Private
possession of land, without profit except from use, promotes improvement; private
ownership, with profit regardless of use, retards improvement. Every city in
the world, in its vacant lots, offers proof of the statement. It is the lots
that are owned, and not those that are held upon ground-lease, that remain vacant.</p>

<small><b>SUMMARY</b>
</small><br>
<small>For hundreds of years property's value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental
stream will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more
years' rent a property will bring. What is so striking about land
values today is that they are rising for reasons independent of their
earnings stream. The major new consideration is their prospect for
future "capital" (that is, land-price) gains. In sum, the ultimate
aim of real estate investors no longer is so much to seek income --
most of which is pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the
property they acquire -- as much as to seek property gains.
Politically opportunites abound. <b>Merely changing zoning in New
York City in the 1980s to allow using commercial loft spaces for
residential purposes had the effect of multiplying asset values five
or tenfold.</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether the gains come from
selling the property or from borrowing
more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
the strategies they developed over the past half century.</small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One could argue that the failure to tax every bit of economic rent that
    accretes to land sites also has destructive consequences, although this is
    somewhat
      open to debate. Classical economists agree that rent collection ought to
    be at least the sum of inflation plus interest, otherwise the public is facilitating
      speculation in ways that distorts urban configurations even more than they
      constitute an inequity. But land sites frequently rise in market price
    far
      more than the rate of inflation, especially in times (as is perhaps true
    today) that a &quot;bubble&quot; in an economic cycle is in full flower.
    Some municipalities, especially on the east and west coasts of US, are today
    claiming to have increases
      in housing prices of as high as 20 percent per annum, a fever that surely
    will not last and will be especially destructive when it collapses.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19]</em></strong></font> <strong>Land
      values are what create that bubble; buildings are subject to continuing depreciation
      just like cars, computers, refrigerators or any other manufactured (capital)
      item. Recovering the economic rent reduces and perhaps even eliminates the
      speculative bubbles and swings that (some argue) account for economic cycles,
      fostering stability and regularity in economic planning and development that
      make for improved financial health to all.</strong></p>
  <p>This reality brings into stark relief the choices which local political
    leaders have. <strong>They may suggest increasing taxes on economic rent
    (i.e., on land value) or recognize that most property owners are counting
    on treating
      their homes
      and other property not as places to live and work so much as investments
    and then lament the poverty of their cities. Owners expect to reap a gain
    from
      their property when they sell, and they are often positioned to make any
    threat to that entitlement politically unpalatable. Farmers sometimes regard
    selling
      their farms as their retirement security. Homeowners sell with the expectation
      that this gain will provide them the means to enter long term end-of-life
    facilities if necessary. Heirs also oppose that recapture just as with a
    reverse mortgage. </strong>But
      for every long-term property owner that walks away with a lifetime's benefit
      of increased rent attached to a land title, there are just as many &#8212; if
      not more &#8212; young households or emerging businesses that are prohibited
      from acquiring a property because of the prohibitively expensive costs.
      In this sense, a title to a socially created stream of rental benefits
      constitutes
      a monopoly privilege to an unearned windfall gain for a lucky few. It is
      both unjust and is socially and economically destructive to the greater
      good. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>The Tax Base</strong></p>
  <p>The next concern should be upon what base to impose a tax &#8212; not about
    taxing whom but taxing what. There are only three possibilities, as all revenue
    streams necessarily come from one of three factors of economic production &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1) upon resources found raw in nature (what was classically called land), <br>
          2) upon our labor, or <br>
    3) upon things created by human hands or minds (capital). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>No other source exists; every possible tax must be on one or some combination
    of these parts. Each of these factors has its price: the price of land is
    counted in economic rent; the price of labor is in wages, and the price of
    capital (its liquid form) is in interest.</p>
  <p>Any tax on capital has its downside effects, so that taxing savings causes
    people to save less, taxing consumption causes people to buy less, and taxing
    buildings causes people to build less. The result is that economists as well
    as businessmen usually frown upon taxing capital. Another alternative is
    to tax labor, but it is even more widely understood that taxing labor normally
    discourages people from working as much as they would in the absence of a
    tax. From this comes sentiment against taxing labor, even though for want
    of any alternative, people have today commonly come to accept it as a necessity.
    But electing to tax labor, just as for taxing capital, forecloses a discussion
    of the virtues of taxing land &#8212; not necessarily land as earth, but
    rather land as location. <strong>Yet land rent is the most attractive tax base of
    all, as rent is not earned; it is windfall income, entirely the result of
    being well situated in any market of scarce natural resources and where community
    demand (rather than one's own efforts) leads to an appreciation of that land's
    price. </strong><strong>To be sure many people have learned to position themselves
    in situations where a land's market value is likely to rise &#8212; indeed
    these people come to think of themselves as astute investors. But the fact
    is that that
    market gain is not of their own doing at all; it is the result of common
    enterprise creating a surplus that comes to settle on land sites. An investment
    in land, in any form it might take, is speculation in greater or lesser degree.</strong></p>
  <p>Land in all its forms is a tax base that also conforms well to all the classic
    principles of sound tax theory as enumerated above. Land is classically taken
    to mean not just surfaces of the earth but places in time, in space, in any
    medium whether it be solid, liquid or gas, and even as a form of light, in
    the electromagnetic spectrum, and in life forms. One needs to return to 19th
    century classical economic definitions of the factors of production to appreciate
    the separate significance of land as it was understood in its manifold forms.
    One should ask how it is that land, so important to 19th century classical
    economic theory, has been given so little attention today in neoclassical
    economics. This is a story only now recovered from the dusty archives of
    academic economic history. Once understood and appreciated, it may be one
    of the greatest, if very silent, political revolutions of world history.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

  election</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>California homeowners are wallowing in unearned increments beyond
    the dreams of avarice, while its governments are courting bankruptcy. <a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/pieces/Buffett_Prop13.html">Warren
    Buffett</a> dared point this out, and overnight changed from the Oracle of
    Omaha into the Numbskull of Nebraska because he does
    not understand the "reality of California politics," the oxymoron du
    jour. ... </p>
  <p>Most candidates for Governor fled like startled deer. Buffett's sponsor,
      well-tailored Mr. Muscles, recalled meeting a tearful widow who said she
      would have been
      taxed out of her home were it not for Prop 13. Poor thing, her home had
    risen in value. No one asked her name, or whether she knew what she was talking
      about, or had her
    claims audited - being a tearful widow "on a fixed income" insulates one
    from reality checks. The press chimed in with pix of poster oldsters, gazing
    from
    their multi-million dollar perches over the blue Pacific, fretting about
    Buffett's solecism and its possible
    effect on them, never mind anyone else.</p>
  <p>Fact is, unearned increments ARE income, at the time they accrue. Illiquid?
      They are better than cash income because you can turn them into cash by borrowing
      on them, and pay no income tax on the cash. If you have trouble with that,
      the tax man himself will arrange it for you by placing a tax lien on your appreciated
      home, rather than foreclose and evict you. This helps explain why we never
      actually see one of these evicted widows suffering from unearned increments
      -- they are maudlin figments for mythmakers. <b>The evictees we do see are
      renters who couldn't pay, and had no equity to mortgage. Who cries for them?</b></p>
  <p>Several rich candidates would pay more under a revived property tax than they
      pay in income taxes. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mr. Muscles, like previous Hollywood idols, gets most of his income as
                    land appreciation. This income is not taxable unless he sells,
          and not then if he hires good lawyers, which of course he does, to
      play his cards right. </li>
    <li>Arianna Huffington lives in a $7 million home, but reports little net
                taxable income. </li>
    <li>Warren Buffett himself, like the owners of so much California land, resides
                    and reports his income out of state. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These facts should tell us something about who pays most of the property tax,
      but no candidate is inferring principles from mere facts. ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_UIaRiCRE.html">read the whole

    Reduce Sprawl </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If land holders can produce a higher return on investment by not using land
    for productive purposes but rather hold it for a higher price from those willing
    and able to pay the higher price in the future, there is a flaw in public policy.
    Public policy thereby gives speculative, nonproductive investment a higher
    return than productive investment. Sprawl is subsidized by taxes on production
    and distribution and the failure to recapture the benefits resulting from public
    improvements. If we choose to end this subsidy, we would
  reduce sprawl.</p>
  <p>One example that I know is that of a friend who bought land within the city
    but did nothing with it. I asked him why he put good money into an investment
    that had no visible return? He replied that, by holding the land for future
    sale or development, his long term return, in capital gains would exceed 18%
    annually. If he built a building on the site now, his long term return would
    only be 12% annually, including both net income plus capital gains. Why should
    he use his land now when it would be more profitable for him to not use it,
    but to hold it for a larger future gain?</p>
  <p>Most major cities have a substantial amount of fully serviced but unused
    or underused land sites. It is estimated that 38% of the land area in Los
    Angeles
    is unused, 30% in New York City and 25% in Washington, D.C. Intercity sites
    are bypassed because land speculators receive a greater benefit by ignoring
    the highest and best use of land sites. A greater profit is made when development
    is delayed and the land price increases to higher levels. But building within
    existing developed areas uses the existing and underused infrastructure,
    roads, transit, public facilities, and services. Sprawl requires new expenditures
    on public goods and services, more government, more taxes, more dislocation.

  <p>The optimal timing of development is an important allocative function that

  <ul>
    <li>taxes on the rental value of land, </li>

  </ul>
  <p>All four taxes reduce incentives for speculation in land, which is generally
    beneficial. The third and fourth produce distortions with respect to incentives
    to develop land, while the first and second do not. All four taxes have some
    beneficial effect of mitigating imperfections in capital markets. All permit

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
    that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
    to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use in an urban context
    is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who gets the principal
    benefits from urban economic growth. Its ownership is a major determinant
    of the degree of economic inequality: <strong>surges of land prices, such
    as have occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause major
    redistributions
    of wealth.</strong> In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and
    nature more generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological
    sustainability. Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing affordability
    and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the land
    question.&#8217; <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Are George&#8217;s arguments about land ownership and wealth inequality
    relevant today? Australia provides an interesting example, because land is
    the single largest item in national wealth. Laurie Aarons outlines the concentration
    of farming land in particular in the hands of a few very wealthy corporations
    and individuals &#8211; what he refers to as &#8216;corporate squattocracy&#8217; (Aarons,
    1999: 23). The relentless increase in urban land values in recent years has
    also produced dramatic redistributions of wealth. In the State of New South
    Wales, for example, land values increased by about $361 billion over the
    period 1993 &#8211; 2003. The existing land-based taxes clawed back only
    $44 billion in government revenues, comprising only about 12% of the land-related
    economic surplus. So 88% was retained as &#8216;unearned income&#8217; by
    landowners (Stilwell and Jordan, forthcoming). A higher rate of land tax
    with fewer exemptions could have substantially reduced this private wealth
    appropriation. This is not necessarily to posit the desirability of recouping
    100% through land tax, because that would certainly raise major problems
    of people&#8217;s ability to pay, given that much of the increased wealth
    resulting from land price inflation has not been realised as current income.
    But it is indicative of the current imbalance between private and public
    appropriations of the surplus arising from increases in land-based wealth. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>The demand for land involves both use values and exchange values. People
    seek land because the housing built on it provides shelter and security,
    but they also purchase it as a store of wealth and a means of capital appreciation.
    A particularly important driver of real estate prices has been the speculative
    demand, as investors seek capital gains in the property market. In Australia,
    this has been such common and longstanding practice that it has been referred
    to as &#8216;the national hobby&#8217; (Sandercock, 1979). By &#8216;creaming
    off&#8217; a part of this potential capital gain, a higher uniform rate of
    land tax would act as a disincentive to this property speculation, and could
    therefore be expected to exert a downward influence on property prices. Georgists
    have always been emphatic that land taxes are different from other taxes
    in this respect &#8211; they depress prices because they reduce demand. So
    the usual fears that a tax will be &#8216;passed on&#8217; to customers (such
    as housing tenants, in this case) do not apply. By making land less attractive
    as an item to be purchased in the hope of making capital gains, land tax
    can therefore be an important check on the inflationary process. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>
