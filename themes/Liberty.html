          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>WE HONOR LIBERTY in name and in
          form. We set up her statues and sound her praises. But we have not
          fully trusted her. And with our growth so grow her demands. She will
          have no half service! Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex
          the ear in empty boastings. For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is
          the natural law &#8212; the law of health and symmetry and strength, of
          fraternity and co-operation.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small> They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission
          when she has abolished hereditary privileges and given men the
          ballot, who think of her as having no further relations to the
          everyday affairs of life, have not seen her real grandeur &#8212; to
          them the poets who have sung of her must seem rhapsodists, and her
          martyrs fools!&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
          <br>
          <small> It is not for an abstraction that men have
          toiled and died; that in every age the witnesses of Liberty have
          stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty have suffered. </small></div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
      We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth,
      knowledge, invention, national strength and national independence as
      other things. But, of all these, Liberty is the source, the mother,
      the necessary condition. </span>She is to virtue what light is to
      color; to
      wealth what sunshine is to grain; to knowledge what eyes are to
      sight. She is the genius of invention, the brawn of national
      strength, the spirit of national independence. Where Liberty rises,
      there virtue grows, wealth increases, knowledge expands, invention
      multiplies human powers, and in strength and spirit the freer nation
      rises among her neighbors as Saul amid his brethren &#8212; taller and
      fairer. Where Liberty sinks, there virtue fades, wealth diminishes,
      knowledge is forgotten, invention ceases, and empires once mighty in
    arms and arts become a helpless prey to freer barbarians! <strong>... </strong></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
      In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces
      that, producing inequality, destroy Liberty.</span> On the horizon the
      clouds begin to lower. Liberty calls to us again. We must follow her
      further; we must trust her fully. Either we must wholly accept her or
      she will not stay. It is not enough that men should vote; it is not
      enough that they should be theoretically equal before the law. They
      must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means
      of life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty
      of nature. Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light! Either this,
      or darkness comes on, and the very forces that progress has evolved
      turn to powers that work destruction. This is the universal law. This
      is the lesson of the centuries. Unless its foundations be laid in
    justice the social structure cannot stand. </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In
      allowing one man to own the land on which and from which other men
      must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a degree which increases
      as material progress goes on. </span>This is the subtle alchemy that
      in
      ways they do not realize is extracting from the masses in every
      civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting
      a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been
      destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political
      freedom, and must soon transmute democratic institutions into
      anarchy.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
        <br>
        <small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> But if, while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey
          her, if we trust Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now
          threaten must disappear, <span style="font-style: italic;">the forces
            that now menace will turn to
            agencies of elevation</span>. </span>Think of the powers now wasted;
          of the
          infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored; of the possibilities
          of which the wondrous inventions of this century give us but a hint.
          With want destroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with the
          fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the jealousy
          and fear that now array men against each other; with mental power
          loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure;
          and who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar?
          Words fail the thought! It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung
          and high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious
          vision which has always haunted man with gleams of fitful splendor.
          It is what he saw whose eyes at Patmos were closed in a trance. It is
          the culmination of Christianity &#8212; the City of God on earth, with
          its walls of jasper and its gates of pearl! It is the reign of the
          Prince of Peace! ... <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/Ode_to_Liberty.html"><span

      <p> <span class="style1">[05]</span> There is a  suggestive fact that must impress any one who thinks over the history  of past eras and preceding civilizations. The great, wealthy and  powerful nations have always lost their freedom; it is only in small,  poor and isolated communities that Liberty has been maintained. So true  is this that the poets have always sung that Liberty loves the rocks  and the mountains; that she shrinks from wealth and power and splendor,  from the crowded city and the busy mart. So true is this that  philosophical historians have sought in the richness of material  resources the causes of the corruption and enslavement of peoples.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="style1">[06] </span>Liberty is natural. Primitive perceptions are of the equal rights  of the citizen, and political organization always starts from this  base. It is as social development goes on that we find power  concentrating, in institutions based upon the equality of rights  passing into institutions which make the many the slaves of the few.  How this is we may see. In all institutions which involve the lodgment  of governing power there is, with social growth, a tendency to the  exaltation of their function and the centralization of their power, and  in the stronger of these institutions a tendency to the absorption of  the powers of the rest. Thus the tendency of social growth is to make  government the business of a special class. And as numbers increase and  the power and importance of each become less and less as compared with  that of all, so, for this reason, does government tend to pass beyond  the scrutiny and control of the masses. The leader of a handful of  warriors, or head man of a little village, can command or govern only  by common consent, and anyone aggrieved can readily appeal to his  fellows. But when a tribe becomes a nation and the village expands to a  populous country, the powers of the chieftain, without formal addition,  become practically much greater. For with increase of numbers scrutiny  of his acts becomes more difficult, it is harder and harder  successfully to appeal from them, and the aggregate power which he  directs becomes irresistible as against individuals. And gradually, as  power thus concentrates, primitive ideas are lost, and the habit of  thought grows up which regards the masses as born but for the service  of their rulers <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

            <p>It is a deep pleasure for me to be here tonight, the guest of the Liverpool

                with my honored countrymen, [including] William Lloyd Garrison of Massachusetts.

            <p>You are right, Mr. Garrison. The true
              republic, the American Republic that we hope for and pray is not
              yet here. (Hear, hear) A poor thing
                is a republic where the tramp jostles the millionaire, where
              liberty is mocked by a paternal system of interference with human
              rights,
              where, under the pretext of protecting labor, labor is robbed!
              (Cheers) And
                here, in the motherland, in the United States, in Australia and
              New Zealand, we of the English tongue find the same difficulties
              confronting us. Liberty
                is not yet here; but, thank God, she is coming. (Cheers) Not
              merely the American Republic, not merely the Republic of the Southern
              Cross,
              not
                merely the Republic of Great Britain and Ireland is it that we
              see in the future, but that great republic that some day is to
              confederate the
                English speaking people everywhere (loud cheers) that is to bring
              a grander &quot;Roman
                peace&quot; to the world. (A voice: More than that.) Aye, more than that &#8212; that
                is to bring civilization as much higher, as much better than
                what we call a Christian civilization, as this is higher and
                better
                than barbarism.
                And already, in meetings such as this, it seems to me that I
                feel an earnest [presentiment] of the coming time when we of
                one blood
                and one
                speech are also to be one. (Cheers) For the same principles,
                for the same great cause that we stand in the United States we
                stand
                here. And
                in a little over a week from now I will be standing on an American
                platform speaking to men whose hearts are beating in the same
                cause in which we

                the voice of Freedom, she will lead and lead him on. Before I was born,
                before our friend there was born, there was in a southern city of the
                United States a young printer bearing the name William Lloyd Garrison.
                (Cheers) He saw around him the iniquity of negro slavery. (Hear, hear)
                The voice of the oppressed cried to him and would not let him rest, and
                he took up the cross. He became the great apostle of human liberty, and
                today in American cities that once hooted and stoned him there are now
                statues raised to William Lloyd Garrison.</p>

        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <p>He began as a protectionist. As he moved on he saw that liberty meant
                something more than simply the abolition of chattel slavery. He saw that
                liberty also meant, not merely the right to freely labor for oneself,
                but the right to freely exchange one's production, and, from a protectionist,
                William Lloyd Garrison became a free trader. (Cheers)</p>

            <p>And now, when the first is gone, the

                he shall buy or to whom he shall sell, shall not attempt to dictate
                to him in any way, but shall confine itself to its proper function
                of preserving
                the public peace, of preventing the strong from oppressing the
                weak, of utilizing for the public good all the revenues that
                belong of right
                to the public, and of managing those affairs that are best managed
                by the whole. (Cheers) Our doctrine is the doctrine of freedom,
                our gospel
                is the gospel of liberty, and we have faith in it, why should

IT is not the business of government to make men virtuous or religious, or to
preserve the fool from the consequences of his own folly. Government should be
repressive no further than is necessary to secure liberty by protecting the equal
rights of each from aggression on the part of others, and the moment governmental
prohibitions extend beyond this line they are in danger of defeating the very
ends they are intended to serve.&#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp17.html">Social

ALL schemes for securing equality in the conditions of men by placing the distribution
of wealth in the hands of government have the fatal defect of beginning at the
wrong end. They pre-suppose pure government; but it is not government that makes
society; it is society that makes government; and until there is something like
substantial equality in the distribution of wealth, we cannot expect pure government. &#8212; <em>Protection

              <p>THE law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just
                as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge
                the equality of right between man and man, just as they insure
                to each the perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal
                liberty of every other, must civilization advance. Just as they
                fail in this, must advancing civilization come to a halt and
                recede. Political economy and social science cannot teach any
                lessons that are not embraced in the simple truths that were
                taught to poor fishermen and Jewish peasants by One who eighteen
                hundred years ago was crucified &#8212; the simple truths which,
                beneath the warpings of selfishness and the distortions of superstition,
                seem to underlie every religion that has ever striven to formulate
                the spiritual yearnings of man. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book

          Our nation was founded on the idea that we are all created equal,

      Justice
      and Economic Reform</a>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the
          classical liberal conception of justice
          are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
          issue of great importance: how are claims of exclusive access to
          natural opportunities to be established?</small>          </div>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Locke qualified his statement
          that we own what we produce
          with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
          common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
          the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
          are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
          the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
          there is plenty of unclaimed land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span>
          Locke does not address
        the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.</small></small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One tradition in classical
          liberalism concerning claims to land is
          that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>,"
          as exemplified by Murray
          Rothbard, who say that there is really no need to be concerned with
          Locke's proviso. Natural opportunities belong to whoever first
          appropriates them, regardless of whether opportunities of equal value
        are available to others.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[13]</span></small></small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>,"
          as inspired if not
          exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
          opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
          that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
          for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
          he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any
          excess in one's claim
          generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
          George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
          nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
          and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
          have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
          generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
        fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two fundamental problems
          with the position of
          homesteading libertarians on claims to land. The first problem is the
          incongruity with historical reality. Humans have emerged from an
          environment of violence. Those who now have titles to land can trace
          those titles back only so far, before they come to events where fiat
          backed by violence determined title. And the persons who were
          displaced at that time themselves had titles that originated in
          violence. If there ever were humans who acquired the use of land
          without forcibly displacing other humans, we have no way of knowing
          who they were or who their current descendants might be. There is, in
          practice, no way of assigning land to the legitimate successors of
          the persons who first claimed land. And to assign titles based on any
          fraction of history is to reward the last land seizures that are not
        rectified.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
          with the position of the
          homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
          unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
          ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
        allocating land.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
          thing, as people stampeded to do
          whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
          decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
          necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. But the homesteading
          libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
        because I got here first," isn't justice.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice -- the balancing of the
          scales -- is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position,
"I
          get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
          natural opportunities of equal value for you." (How one compares, in
          practice, the value of different natural opportunities is a bit
          complex. If you really want to know, you can invite me back for
        another lecture.)</small></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;">          </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice is thus a regime in
          which persons have the greatest
          possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
          share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
          reform--the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
          acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
          that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
          opportunities. </small><small>...</small> <small><small>&nbsp; <big><a

    <blockquote>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">A possible difficulty with classical liberalism as a justification for
            government action is that it may justify little if any government action.
            Taxes intrude upon individual liberty. How is this intrusion to be justified?
            One way to try to get around this difficulty is by the claim that some
            expenditures on protecting individual rights are so valuable that anyone
            would understand that, for these expenditures, the reduction in individual
            liberty from taxation is less than the addition to individual liberty from
            the protection of individual rights that is possible with taxation. However,
            if improving the well-being of all citizens is the justification, then
            one should ask whether there is adequate justification for even these government
          actions if they do not have unanimous support.</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">Supporters of government action might argue that if unanimous support
            were required, then the problem of selfish individuals holding out for
            greater shares of the surplus would raise transactions costs to the point
            where nothing could be done, even if there were things that would make
            everyone better off. But that justification carries the risk of justifying
            nearly anything. If those in power have an excuse to ignore what citizens
            say about what they value, what limits to power are there?</div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">Geoliberalism offers a different way of justifying public spending and
            the taxation that finances it. If people are perfectly mobile, and if there
            are enough people who value a local public good to fill the area that benefits
            from it, then the provision of a local public good will raise land rents
            by enough to pay for the public good. In collecting the rental value of
            land, governments will collect enough to pay for any worthwhile local public
            goods that they provide.</div>
      </div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">Under the conservative or homesteading
          libertarian versions of classical liberalism, the possessor of land
          might say, "This
            is my land. I didn't ask for these public goods. You have no right to tax
            me to pay for them." Under geoliberalism, on the other hand, the community
            can reply, "You have as much right to the use of land and other natural
            opportunities as anyone else. If you want to exercise your rights in this
            community, these are the taxes you must pay. If you don't like it, claim
            your share of natural opportunities somewhere else." ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read

    Fred Foldvary:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Well_being.html">Well
being and being well off</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I see three ways in which one
can define "well off." </small><br>
<small><b>First,
one is better or worse off relative to the distribution of wealth or
income in a particular society. ... </b></small><br>
<small><b> Secondly, being well off can be thought of as relative to
the typical person in the economy. ...</b></small><br>
<small><b>Third, one can define "well off" in absolute terms. ...</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Being absolutely well off means, </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>first, that one is able to rise substantially above
subsistence through peaceful and honest means, whether from one's
labor, from one's rightful share of natural and contractual benefits,
or from gifts.</small></li>
  <li><small>Secondly, to be absolutely well off requires complete <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">liberty</span>, so that the only legal
restriction is the prohibition of coercive harm to others. Liberty
includes security against attack, either by government or by private
persons, since one is not really free if one is under substantial
threats of death and theft against which one is helpless.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
With liberty, one is free to
establish whatever relationships
one wishes, so long as others are also willing.</span> With liberty and
the
ability to obtain wealth, one can obtain assurance of future wealth
both because one is able to earn it and also because one is able to
store wealth and insure oneself against risk.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> My Dictionary of Free-Market
Economics defines "well-being" as
"The amount and degree to which individuals in an economy are able to
pursue and attain their ends." <b>The only requirement for absolute
well being, for someone who is mentally and physically able to
produce wealth, is liberty.</b> With liberty, one can obtain wealth,
friends, and future security, express oneself as one pleases, and
enjoy life in accord with one's values and lifestyle preference.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Being absolutely well off does
not involve any particular
level of wealth beyond subsistence, since this depends on personal
preference. An artist may prefer to live at subsistence and devote
her time to art, and that person is absolutely well off because she
is pursuing happiness in her own way. As with relative well being,
one can be well off in the absolute sense without being happy, as for
example a person who has much wealth but has lost love or has a
serious illness.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
What is required for there to be complete liberty? </span>There must
be a basic law such that any act that does not invade the domain of
others is not prohibited or taxed. In liberty, there are only
prohibitions if there are victims who are coercively harmed, and
there is restitution for damages to others. In liberty, people have
equal rights and no special legal privileges. In a free society,
nobody starves, because one is able to save for the future, because
on obtains one's equal share of natural and civic benefits, and
because the sympathy of society will not let people starve.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The economic policy of liberty
has four rules:</small></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><small>To the creator belongs the creation.</small></li>
    <li><small>The profit of nature's creation belongs equally to all.</small></li>
    <li><small>The benefit of what is created by government belongs to
all the people in its jurisdiction.</small></li>
    <li><small>W</small><small>hen the initial distribution is
just,
the outcomes of free exchange are just and should not be
hampered.&nbsp; <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Foldvary_Well_being.html"><span

 style="font-weight: bold;">THE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS</span>:
OPPORTUNITY LOST?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Publisher's pamphlet, circa
1970: </small><br>
<small>Apart from Free Trade, the great economic and social issues were
taxation and the alleviation of poverty. The Liberals were concerned to
remove the basic cause of the problem -- not just to mitigate its
undesirable effects.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the American economist <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="About_HG.html">Henry George</a></span> who, towards the end of
the 19th century, had examined the paradox of the age in his <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>.
His principles had a major impact, first upon the radicals of Scotland
and Ireland, including Campbell Bannerman himself; and later upon the
policy of the Liberal Party.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry
George
propounded that whilst people have the right to possess what they
produce, or receive in exchange for their work, there is no such right
to private ownership of the elements upon which all depend -- air,
water, sunshine and land. Indeed, George held the right of access to
these basic elements as strong and equal as the right to life itself,
and that if private ownership of basic elements is permitted,
suppression and exploitation of one class by another is inevitable. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The consequent injustice must
become more acute as the community develops.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it became a major point of Liberal
policy to
shift taxation from production, and to raise taxation upon the value of
land, on the basis that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> this value, as
witnessed by the tremendously high prices even then demanded for
commercial land, is created not by any individual but by the existence
and work of the whole community.</span> A natural source thus arises
from which the community may meet its growing needs without
discouraging production or inhibiting the growth of earnings.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The justice
and
practicality of this proposition can rarely if ever have enjoyed a more
brilliant advocate than Winston Churchill, and today's reader is left
to wonder how different might be the present state of Britain had the
forces of social change pursued these principles to their enactment.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
People's Rights tells a very different story and comes
now not as a document of historic interest but as a challenge to
politicians, indeed to the entire electorate, to consider again the
causes of poverty and the basic issues of social and economic justice.
Perhaps current disillusionment with politics springs from a sense that
if justice in the community can only be achieved at the expense of
individual liberty, the price -- especially in terms of ever-increasing
taxation and bureaucracy -- is too high to pay.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a proposition that justice in the
community and the freedom of
the individual are complementary and that taxes may be raised without
undermining either, The People's Rights comes as a major contribution
to current political and economic thought. Indeed it deserves a place
in the annals of Man's struggle for freedom and yearning for a society
in which the genius of every person would be nurtured and the liberty
of every person respected. ...

Market Strategy to Reduce Sprawl</a><ul>
  <li><small>Unused land is far more abundant than we realize.</small></li>
  <li><small>End the Public Subsidy of Land Speculation and Sprawl</small></li>
  <li><small>Counterproductive growth limitations and regulations
should be abolished.</small></li>

</ul>
<small>It was estimated that the BART transportation system in San
Francisco produced two times more land value than it cost to build.
The public recaptured only a small part of the cost from benefits
provided by land taxes and user fees. Most of the cost came from
external sources, unrelated sales and income taxes. Most of the
profits went into only a few pockets.</small>
<p><small>Thus, the claim that a community is short of capital is
misleading. In fact, a community could become self-sufficient in the
supply of capital from internal sources. But a precondition for this
is the reduction of taxes on productive capital and labor. Examine,
for example, what would happen as a result of the elimination of
taxation of buildings. This decision, not to penalize people who
invest their savings in new buildings, leads to the stimulation of a
higher level of national income, higher saving, and the creation of
new capital. According to the study made by Tideman and Plassmann
(1998, The Losses of Nations, Fred Harrison, editor, Orthila Press),
shifting taxes off buildings, production and distribution, and onto
land and natural resources, could increase the gross national product
by 25%, or one <span style="font-style: italic;">trillion </span>1998
dollars
($1,000,000,000,000).</small></p>
<p><small>The Land Value Tax Shift from labor and capital is not only a
key
to reversing suburban sprawl and protecting rural environments -- it
is a key to realizing the dream and fulfilling promises of a truly
free market -- with liberty, prosperity, and justice for all.&nbsp; ...
