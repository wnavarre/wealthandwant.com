<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Tiebout Model</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Fred
Foldvary: <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><a
 href="../docs/Foldvary_Geo-Rent.html">Geo-Rent:
A Plea to Public Economists</a></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The landmark model of
competition among communities in the provision of
collective goods is that of Charles Tiebout (1956), which, as Bruce
Hamilton (1991, 672) stated, offered an "antidote to Samuelson's rather
gloomy results." Paul Samuelson (1954, 388) had stated categorically, "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">no decentralized pricing system can serve
to determine optimally these levels of collective consumption</span>"
(italics in the original).</small><br>
<br>
<small>Tiebout&#8217;s analysis shows that this conclusion does not hold for
local
civic goods. The consumers can select the communities which best
satisfy their preferences. In the Tiebout model, unlike the Buchanan
club model, the provision of the club goods is held fixed. Consumers
reveal their demands for collective goods through a choice of
community, and competition among communities assures that local
collective goods are provided at minimum cost. Residents dissatisfied
with their community's civic goods will leave, resulting in, at the
limit, homogenous communities with respect to the public goods desired
by the residents. Joseph Stiglitz (1983) points out that pure
homogeneity is not necessary to the Tiebout conclusions if there are
productive interactions among people, if there are transportation
costs, and if people have different utility functions for land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Though Tiebout in his model recognizes space with respect to
congestion, it is unfortunate that the model itself has no spatial
dimensions and no land rent. It was unfortunate both because it made
the Tiebout model incomplete and because much of the subsequent Tiebout
literature also ignores land. As stated by Hamilton (1991, 673), "the
tax instrument is of critical importance if the efficiency or even
existence of a Tiebout equilibrium is to be achieved." And as stated by
Blankart and Borck (2004, 455), "Problems arise in the Tiebout model if
public services are financed by distortionary taxation."</small><br>
<br>
<small>The value of a city park
diminishes with the distance from the park. Therefore, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ceteris paribus</span>,
those closest to the park will have a higher geo-rent. The most
efficient way to finance the community is from the geo-rent, not by
equal dues payments. The Tiebout model will reflect the territorial
ambit of goods only when land and location are taken into account.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The spatial dimension has been recognized in the Henry George
Theorem
and by analysts who have incorporated the capitalization of civic goods
into site value. The empirical studies of Wallace Oates (1969) found
evidence for the capitalization of the benefits of local collective
goods and of property taxes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Buchanan and Goetz (1972) found that the internalization of what
otherwise would be externalities would occur if the communities are
proprietary and if competition equalizes the value of the externality.
"Tax shares would have to be related to the size of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">locational </span>rent
component in individual income receipts" (35; italics in the original).
"If all valued 'space' should be privately owned and if competition
among proprietary ownership units were effective in all respects,
allocational efficiency might emerge" (40). Tyler Cowen (1988, p. 14)
notes that models such as that of Buchanan and Goetz "offer the
intriguing suggestion that Tiebout's model is better suited to analyses
of collective goods provision through proprietary communities." <a

Ethics of Coercion in Public Finance</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another economic tradition that
comes close to consistency with
justice is the Tiebout (1956) tradition, which is concerned primarily
with efficiency. In the Tiebout tradition, people sort themselves
into communities composed of individuals who have the same
preferences for local public expenditures. They are treated justly
when they are required to pay taxes to finance public goods, because
anyone who is unhappy with his tax bill is free to move to another
community.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The principal difficulty with
Tiebout's suggestion as a way of
achieving justice is that it is developed in the context of a world
with an unlimited amount of land. In today's world, people have
little opportunity to form communities that express their own tastes
for public services, because all land is already claimed by some
sovereign nation that specifies the taxes that people who live there
must pay.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>...&nbsp; <a

Evolution</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The limits of individual self-definition are reached when one comes to goods
    such as air quality, which can only be consumed
  collectively.<font size="-1"><b><i>12 </i></b></font> But since no individual
  can assert, within the constraints imposed by Neutrality, that his conception
  of the proper trade-off between air quality and other goods is superior to
  that proposed by any other person, liberal principles come under tension. Ackerman
  makes two suggestions for liberal ways of dealing with this tension. The first
  is what Ackerman calls federalism (which would be more familiar to economists
  under the name of the <strong>Tiebout</strong> solution): Let people sort themselves out into
  groups that favor the same level of air quality and each have the level they
  prefer. Ackerman recognizes that this solution is not perfect, both because
  it
  is not possible for every option with respect to provision of public goods
  to be offered, and because costs
  of moving are significant. "Despite these serious imperfections," Ackerman says, "a
  federal regime is far better than some all-or-nothing solution that would force
  all deviants to pay for a collectively specified level of good air or force
  all environmentalists to suffer with bad air merely because they cannot transcend
  the organizational hurdles imposed upon them by an individualistic property-holding
  system."<font size="-1"><b><i>13</i></b></font></p>
  <p>The other suggestion that Ackerman offers for dealing with differing tastes
    for public goods is "Lindahl solutions," in which people are called upon
    to pay for public goods in proportion to the benefits they receive, though
    he
    recognizes that we do not possess the means to implement this concept perfectly.
    Two chapters later, Ackerman addresses the issue of how to resolve disagreements
    regarding the best approximation to the liberal ideal when its complete attainment
    is not possible.<font size="-1"><b><i>14</i></b></font> Here he offers a different
    pair of suggestions: majority rule (with any majority-rule cycles that arise
    resolved by a random process), and the use of a lottery to pick one of the
    suggested options. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_PEME.html">read the whole article</a></p>
