Lindy Davies:  <a href="../docs/davies_Top10Land.html">The Top Ten Reasons Why Land is More Important than Ever
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The <a
 href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/rem0.htm">Georgist
economic proposal</a> insists on the primary importance of land as a
factor in the economy. Many people dismiss that as a quaint, agrarian
notion. "Perhaps," they scoff, "land was that significant back when
most people had to work the soil for a living, but modern agriculture
has moved far past that! Nowadays we deal with modern issues of
technology, global markets, information -- land is no longer a big
deal."<br>
10. There's no place to dump your trash for free. ...<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">9. Scratch a financial crisis, find a
real estate bubble. ...</span><br>
8. Information (like railroads) needs routes. ...<br>
7. Cities can no longer afford to be inefficient. ... <br>
6. Global climate change is too likely to ignore. ...<br>
5. The loss of biological diversity cannot be reversed. ...<br>
4. Two out of every five people lack a safe and dependable
source of drinking water. ...<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. The myth of overpopulation causes
cultural sickness. ...</span><br>

Justice</small></small></a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our problem today, as yesterday,
and the days before, back to the
earliest recorded times, is POVERTY.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are times when this problem
is lesser. We call these
"booms." There are also times when the problem is greatly
exacerbated. These are called "busts." But, as the Bible says, "the
poor have ye always with ye."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The purpose of this paper is to
explore the core of the problem.
It is not the position that there is only one single error afoot in
our social organizations. There may be several, there may be only a
few things to remedy. The position is, as stated earlier, that there
is one basic cause of the problem. Therefore, the removal of this one
basic error is the first, the primary step, for the simple reason
that, until this basic social evil is eradicated, no other reform
will avail. We will simply continue the boom and bust cycles until
the economies of the whole world are wrecked by inflation or by a
nuclear war triggered by the ongoing economic disaster.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let us begin this study of the
likely causes of our troubles by
asking two questions: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><strong>Are we over-populated? 
    </strong></small></li>
  <li><strong><small>Are the earth's
resources inadequate for this population? </small></strong><small>    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our stage, of course, for
making this study will be this world of ours, for it is upon this
world that the drama of human living is played out, with all its joys
and all its sorrows, with all its great achievements and all its
failures, with all its nobilities and all its wickedness.&nbsp; </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Regardless of its size relative to
other planets, with its
circumference of about twenty-five thousand miles, to any mere mortal
who must walk to the station and back each day, it is huge. Roughly
ninety-six million miles separate the sun from the earth on the
latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this distance, the
earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and it spins
on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's rays are
distributed far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage and
maximizing their benefits.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider the complementarity of
nature in the case of the two
forms of life we call vegetable and animal, in their respective uses
of the two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, the waste product of
each serving as the life-giving force of the other. Any increase in
the one will encourage a like response in the other.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marvel at the manner in which
nature, with no help from man or
beast, delivers pure water to the highest lands, increasing it as to
their elevation, thus affording us a free ride downstream and free
power as we desire it. Look with awe at the variety and quantity of
minerals with which this world is blessed, and finally at the
fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both animal and
vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels from a single
stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of this year's
crop; then think of the vastly greater yields from a single cherry
pit or the seeds of a single apple, or grape or watermelon; or,
turning to the animal world, consider the hen who averages almost an
egg a day and the spawning fish as examples of the prolificacy that
is evident throughout the whole of the animal world, including
mankind.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If this marvelous earth is as rich
in resources as portrayed in
the foregoing paragraph, then the problem must be one of
distribution: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>how is the land distributed among the earth's
inhabitants, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>how are its products in turn distributed?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land is universally treated as
either public property or private
property. Wars are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated as common
property.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George has described this world as
a "well-provisioned ship" and
when one considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals of such
provisions as coal and petroleum as have occurred say over the past
one hundred years, one must but agree with this writer. But this is
only a static view. Consider the suggestion of some ten years ago
that it would require the conversion of less than 20% the of the
current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the motors
then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The dynamic picture
of the future is indeed awesome, and there is every indication that
that characteristic has the potential of endless expansion. <b>So how
is it that on so richly endowed a Garden of Eden as this world of
ours we have only been able to make of it a hell on earth for vast
numbers of people?</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The answers are simple: we have
permitted, nay we have even more
than that, encouraged, the gross misallocation of resources and a
viciously wicked distribution of wealth, and we choose to be governed
by those whom we, in our ignorance, have elected.&nbsp; ... ... <a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended for social
    needs is shown by the final proof. God is indeed a jealous God in the sense
    that nothing but injury and disaster can attend the effort of men to do things
    other than in the way he has intended; in the sense that where the blessings
    he proffers to men are refused or misused they turn to evils that scourge
    us. And just as for the mother to withhold the provision that fills her breast
    with the birth of the child is to endanger physical health, so for society
    to refuse to take for social uses the provision intended for them is to breed
    social disease.</p>
  <p>For refusal to take for public purposes the increasing values that attach
    to land with social growth is to necessitate the getting of public revenues
    by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution and corrupt society.
    It is to leave some to take what justly belongs to all; it is to forego the
    only means by which it is possible in an advanced civilization to combine
    the security of possession that is necessary to improvement with the equality
    of natural opportunity that is the most important of all natural rights.
    It is thus at the basis of all social life to set up an unjust inequality
    between man and man, compelling some to pay others for the privilege of living,
    for the chance of working, for the advantages of civilization, for the gifts
    of their God. But it is even more than this. The very robbery that the masses
    of men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery.
    For the value that with the increase of population and social advance attaches
    to land being suffered to go to individuals who have secured ownership of
    the land, it prompts to a forestalling of and speculation in land wherever
    there is any prospect of advancing population or of coming improvement, thus
    producing an artificial scarcity of the natural elements of life and labor,
    and a strangulation of production that shows itself in recurring spasms of
    industrial depression as disastrous to the world as destructive wars. It
    is this that is driving men from the old countries to the new countries,
    only to bring there the same curses. It is this that causes our material
    advance not merely to fail to improve the condition of the mere worker, but
    to make the condition of large classes positively worse. It is this that
    in our richest Christian countries is giving us a large population whose
    lives are harder, more hopeless, more degraded than those of the veriest
    savages. <strong>It is this that leads so many men to think that God is
    a bungler and is constantly bringing more people into his world than he has
    made provision for; or that there is no God, and that belief in him is a
    superstition which the facts of life and the advance of science are dispelling</strong>.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>2. Effect of
artificial scarcity on marginal returns to labor and capital.</b>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Underuse of better lands
forces labor and capital (which is mobile,
like labor) to resort to worse or &#8220;marginal&#8221; lands, thus
scattering and spreading out settlement, raising aggregate demands on
land, and wasting capital </span>(George, 1879). This lowering of the
&#8220;margin of production&#8221; lowers the marginal productivity of
labor and capital, and hence their economic rewards, tilting the
distribution of income in favor of landowners, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">creating an illusion
of overpopulation</span> (Malthus), and lack of investment outlets
(Marx,
Keynes, Hobson et al.). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That pattern was first recognized
in farming, but it is universal.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The underuse of central city lands
(large parts of which are
derelict) drives demand outwards to less accessible urban sites. From
there, the same force drives demand outwards to the inner suburbs;
from there, to further suburbs, and so on. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;Urban sprawl&#8221;
is the generic name, but &#8220;scatter&#8221; and
&#8220;disintegration&#8221; express the point better.</span> Farm and
wilderness defenders perceive the problem mainly at the edge of
cities, noting the loss of open land, but that is a lesser social and
economic loss than the destruction of urban values inside the edge. ...<a href="../docs/Gaffney_FEFPOASP-RPWHTE.html"><span
