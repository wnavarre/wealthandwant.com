    Nic Tideman:<a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html"> The Case
    for Site
    Value Rating</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit. ... <br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The whole practice of planning
should be replaced by a system of
charges for harmful consequences of land use and payments for
beneficial ones. Planning is motivated by a concern for the harmful
consequences that can result from land development. But the resulting
restriction in land development makes planning permission all the
more valuable to the few who receive it, with the result that vast
fortunes are made by contriving to appear to have, in one's person or
in one's projects, whatever attributes are regarded as attractive by
those who grant planning permission. With so much money at stake, it
is virtually impossible to avoid bias. A recognition of the
impropriety of the large gains from receiving planning permission
leads planning bodies to be ever more strict about granting it, and
the result is ever higher prices of homes, to the detriment of
first-time buyers.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When there are harmful
consequences of land development, these are
generally manifest in lower rental values of land near the land that
is developed. The effort that is now devoted to determining whether
to grant planning permission should be spent instead on identifying
the magnitudes of the harmful consequences of development. Then
everyone who wishes to develop land, and everyone who has title to
land that is already developed, should be charged those costs. Those
who have land that is adversely affected by development would be
compensated automatically through the reduction in the rates on their
land.&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html"> <span

Incentive Taxation Philosophy</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">  
  <p><a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_Tenets.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><small><b>Ending Privilege</b></small></p>
  <p><small>When
            the principle that the value
        of government-assigned
        opportunities should be received by the public treasury is violated,
        the result is "privilege," which from its Latin roots means "<b>private law</b>," that
        is, law that permits one person to do what
        others are not permitted to do. Thus <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">what we stand for is an end to
    privilege.</span></small></p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Numerous examples of privilege are
incorporated in our
institutions.</small></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small>Farm legislation restricts the growing of tobacco to
those
who have been assigned acreage allotments.</small></li>
    <li><small>For numerous commodities, trade legislation limits
shipments from individual countries to specified quotas.</small></li>
    <li><small>In many cities, only persons who have been given permits
are allowed to operate taxis, and new permits are not issued.</small></li>
    <li><small>To operate a radio or television station requires a
license, and there are no opportunities for new licenses to be issued.</small></li>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;"><small>In most cities, construction
of
commercial or multi-family residential structures requires zoning
permission that is granted to some and not to others.</small></li>
    <li><small>But the single most important category of privilege is
land titles.</small></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This list of examples of
privilege, which is by no means
exhaustive, contains some privileges, such as acreage allotments and
import quotas, that would be best reformed by eliminating
restrictions and permitting all to do what now only some may do. For
other privileges, such as broadcast licenses and land titles, great
productivity results from the social understanding that a specified
individual will have the use of a given resource. For these
privileges, the best reform is the introduction of the requirement
that any person who is assigned such an opportunity must pay to the
public treasury an annual fee equal to what the opportunity would be
worth to someone else.&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Making Housing
Affordable</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The implementation of our ideas
  would have a dramatic effect in
  making housing more affordable. The principal reason why housing
  costs have risen so much is that the price of land has risen
  enormously. Some increase in the price of access to land is a natural
  accompaniment of an increasing population.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the very great increases of
recent years, which have made it
nearly impossible for young families to afford houses of their own,
have additional causes. The implementation of our ideas would bring
down the price of access to land in three ways.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, much land is held off the market by speculators who
may wait generations do decide to develop it. The introduction of a fee
for holding land, whether used or not, equal to the rental value of the
land, will induce speculators to either develop this land themselves or
turn it over to someone who will.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, an important
cause of higher prices for access to land by those who wish to build
low-cost housing is zoning restrictions. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">These restrictions are introduced
by political factions that already have their houses and do not mind if
housing becomes scarcer. It just raises the market value of their
homes. </span>But if a rise in land values were accompanied by rises
in the fees that existing residents had to pay for the use of the land
on which their houses sit, they would have an incentive to do what they
could to make land plentiful rather than scarce, and zoning
restrictions could be expected to diminish.</small></li>
  <li><small>Third, a person who wishes to own a house must borrow
money to cover the price of buying the title to the land on which the
house sits as well as the cost of the house itself. If the use of land
required the payment of a fee equal to the rental value of land, so
that the selling price of land titles became virtually zero, then the
amount of money that a family would have to borrow to purchase a house
would fall.&nbsp;</small><small> <a href="../docs/Tideman_Tenets.html"><span

Karl Williams: <a href="../docs/Williams_Landlording.html">Landlording
It Over Us</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Geoism holds that there&#8217;s nothing necessarily wrong with being rich &#8211;
indeed, an economic system exists whereby we could ALL be rich (in
wealth, education or leisure time). The justification for riches all
depends on whether a wealthy person has become so through creating
wealth (in the form of goods and services that people willingly buy in
a free and fair market) or through living off the wealth really created
by others. Earned wealth might arise through talented or arduous
inventing, writing, sports ability,
entertaining, entrepreneurialship or whatever. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Geoism seeks to expose the many forms of unearned wealth, or
privilege,
that exist in our monstrous economic system. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Monopoly rights are the more obvious
examples of economic privilege, but less noticeable is the massive
wealth to be gained by using the Global Commons (especially land)
without reimbursing the rest of us. ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>But the rewards of land go far beyond status, evidenced by how,
over
the centuries, the land-owning elite has pulled the levers of power in
society, politics and the world of commerce. The Earl of Derby&#8217;s 1881
candid analysis of the benefits of owning land perhaps says it best, </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>&#8220;One, political influence; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>two, social importance; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>three, power exercised over tenantry;</small></li>
  <li><small>four, residential enjoyment including what is called
sport; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>five, the money return &#8211; the rent.&#8221;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since then, the reform of the
House of Lords has dented the political
influence that was previously wielded by the landowning class (titles
and land were once synonymous). But who needs status? &#8211; let&#8217;s get crass
and just go for the cash. The great windfall profits which are dropped
into landowners&#8217; laps (which rightly belongs to the community) occurs
with <span style="font-weight: bold;">rezoning </span>and the growth
in residential/industrial values. In the
UK between 1991 and 2001, the total return by this measure (including
capital growth and rental income) averaged a healthy 12.6% per year.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The gross injustice of handing over community-created values to
landowners is revealed by cold, hard figures. According to Yolande
Barnes, head of research at FPD Savills, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the average UK building plot &#8211;
at &pound;709,650 for a greenfield acre &#8211; is worth around 403 times the
equivalent agricultural land. </span>Nationwide, through this form of
rezoning, around &pound;5bn. windfall profit is handed over to UK
landowners each year.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Barnes explains further, &#8220;In many parts of the South and
Southeast, it
is certainly true that prices are paid for agricultural land that
wouldn&#8217;t be justified by its agricultural value.&#8221; She said further that
it is impossible to know how much of this differential is accounted for
by a "hope" factor &#8211; a speculative play on future change of use &#8211; and
how
much represents the premium for land&#8217;s amenity value when it is in such
short supply. But she adds: &#8220;There has certainly been a deal of
strategic holding and buying on
city and town fringes by agricultural owners and farmers. New
development land is usually designated in &#8220;fill-ins&#8221; and close to
existing developments.&#8221;&nbsp; She added further that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">farmers buy around
towns because they can&#8217;t lose. They&#8217;ll farm the land anyway, and if
permission is given to build, they&#8217;ve won the lottery. </span></small><br

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Owners paying higher land dues feel pressured
to develop their land in order to pay their dues, and development is
already blighting many suburbs and farmland. Won't the PTS force
premature or excessive development, losing open space and ecologically
sensitive areas? Environmentalists should understand that development
is actually needed to spare land. Using some land more intensely means
using other land not at all. The PTS stimulates construction in the
most intensely-used locations; compact urban form leaves more
surrounding countryside pristine. Since about one-fifth of urban areas
are vacant or underused land, and half is devoted to cars, there's
plenty of room in cities for growth. While suburban commercial centers
compete with downtown for redevelopment, each new building, whether for
business or residents, must find tenants.<br>
<br>
Higher density is the expected result of the PTS, yet many people
oppose higher density. However, the noxious component is not a higher
density of population but of automobiles, creating congestion, noise,
noxious smells, and danger. The PTS, by clearing out the infestation of
vehicles, makes human habitats more livable and the added people
unnoticeable.<br>
<br>
Without coercion or remote planning, the PTS improves our settlement
patterns. Regulations and zoning, some assume, might be vitiated or
obviated, become obsolete. Instead, the PTS makes it easier for
regulations and zoning to do their job. Since the land tax lowers land
price, buying land for parks and reserves is more easily afforded. The
loss in revenue from removing the newly public lands from the tax rolls
would be offset somewhat by the corresponding rise in value of sites
near the protected open space. Creating green spaces raises the density
of already developed land, and thus its value. Furthermore, land dues
reduce the profit from land development, making it a less attractive
investment, and land use decisions of less economic consequence. After
a while, people with deep pockets would turn to investments that,
post-shift, would be untaxed. Reserving land for recreational or
natural uses becomes less contentious; people could more easily
determine an optimum proportion of green space to developed space.<br>
<br>
Redirecting land rent from owner to government might merely pass the
motive to exploit from owner to state, possibly the next implacable
force against conservation. However, while an individual must use their
own land most intensely to maximize profit, a government must optimize
land use to maximize its land tax base. That is, land value thruout the
jurisdiction is lower when there is border-to-border development;
overall values are higher when some space is kept open. From the
government's point of view, there's more rent to be collected when
highest and best use includes nonuse. ... <br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value
gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This price appreciation is
actually
a "land gain," that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">rezoning </span>is favorable
from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
<br>
<small><b>Two appraisal
methods</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways.
Both start by estimating its
market value.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of
buildings from this overall value, designating the remainder as the
value of land. Building values may be estimated in terms of their <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">replacement </span>cost (which
usually produces a very high estimate, leaving
little land value) or their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">depreciated
    </span>value (which gives an
unrealistically low building estimate, inasmuch as maintenance and
repairs save most buildings from deteriorating through wear and tear).
Using the depreciated value method leaves a higher residual land value.
The Federal Reserve Board recently has experimented with a hybrid
intermediate method that values buildings on the basis of their
"historical costs".</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing
the land,
and treats the difference as representing the building's value. The
first step in this approach is to construct a land-value map for the
district or city. This displays fairly smooth contours for land values.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overlays would show
zoning variations.</span> Most of the variations in
property prices around this normalized map will be for structures,
along with a sizable component of "errors and omissions." This approach
rarely is used, and most assessed land values vary drastically from one
parcel to the next. The problem is especially apparent in the case of
parking lots or one-story "taxpayers," that is, inexpensive buildings
in neighbourhoods that are heavily built up. Their purpose is simply to
be rented out at enough to carry the property's tax bill, not to
maximise the site's current economic value.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
appraisal methods do not
acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
changed in comparison to the property's overall value?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve
multiplies the building's original cost by the
rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is agreed that any
explanation of land/building relations
should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
<b><i>uniform</i></b> and <b><i>homogeneous</i></b> as possible. By
that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
accordingly.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
accepted, then I believe that economists
would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
opposite usually is done.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>SUMMARY</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For hundreds of years property's
value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental
stream will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more
years' rent a property will bring. What is so striking about land
values today is that they are rising for reasons independent of their
earnings stream. The major new consideration is their prospect for
future "capital" (that is, land-price) gains.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> In sum, the ultimate
aim of real estate investors no longer is so much to seek income --
most of which is pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the
property they acquire -- as much as to seek property gains.</span>
Politically opportunites abound. <b>Merely changing zoning in New
York City in the 1980s to allow using commercial loft spaces for
residential purposes had the effect of multiplying asset values five
or tenfold.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether the gains come from
selling the property or from borrowing
more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
the strategies they developed over the past half century.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nationwide the capital-gains
dimension needs to be incorporated
into the rental revenue statistics to measure real estate's total
returns. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sector's
nearly complete success in escaping the tax
collector has placed an enormous tax burden on everyone else.</span></b>

<blockquote>
  <p>... If the reader has followed thus far, he is perhaps ready to inquire why,
      if the abolition of taxation is so desirable and so feasible, it should not
      be
      put into effect without more delay. In partial answer, it may be said that
      the body social has slid so far down from the right path in this matter that
      climbing back to it is no short or easy process. The way up bristles with problems,
      one of which is of course the opposition of a class of land speculators. Another
      relates itself to the regulation of the height and area of buildings in cities.</p>
  <p>Even under our present system of taxed buildings, the desire to create the
      maximum of rentable space upon costly land has resulted in such lofty and closely
      packed structures as to endanger safety and health; and restrictive legislation
      has already been found necessary. When the landowner can no longer appropriate
      the larger part of economic rent and must rely for his profit mainly upon the
      rent of his untaxed buildings, such restrictions may have to be elaborated
      and watchfully enforced for the protection of the people.</p>
  <p>Naturally such restrictions will lower the economic rent, but the reduction
      need never be sufficient to impair the necessary public income while ample
      compensation will be seen in the enhanced well-being of the community due to
      increased light, air and space.</p>
  <p>But, whatever difficulties are to be met, it may be set down as an encouraging
      fact that the problem involved in doing things right is always less than those
      resulting from doing the same things wrong; and, Heaven knows, our way back
      to fiscal sanity cannot be through any worse jungle than that in which current
      taxation keeps us and will keep us so long as it is permitted to continue.

  <p>    Indeed, one could say that the term &#8216;tax&#8217; is a misnomer
    because what is really involved is value created by the community being retained
    by the community rather than being appropriated by private landholders. For
    example, <strong>under current arrangements landowners receive &#8216;windfall&#8217; gains
    when the market value of their land rises</strong> as a result of publicly provided
    infrastructure being built nearby, or <strong>when local government zoning

    individual landowners stand to reap huge benefits at the expense of community-generated
    processes. Such arrangements create an odd incentive: allowing landholders
    to appropriate the unearned wealth generated by rising land values, thereby
    rewarding this unproductive activity, while taxing productive endeavour.
    The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217;, by contrast, would eliminate

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">Stemming Sprawl: The Fiscal Approach</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stemming Sprawl: Command-and-Control Measures</strong></p>
  <p> Policymakers have two modes of leverage by which to implement public will:
      1) so-called command-and-control approaches that are typically enforced
    by what state and federal constitutions group under &quot;police powers&quot; and
      2) fiscal approaches that typically involve a variety of taxes, fees, fines,
      and other charges that derive constitutionally from either police powers or &quot;tax
      powers.&quot; When governments administer either of these powers, they
      are legitimate and authoritative. Fiscal measures available to governments
      can
      come from either ground. The charges that the private sector usually impose
      differ in that they usually are responsive to market forces. Prices that
      are established by government, however, are not necessarily responsive
      to market
      forces, nor are they intended to be. Rather, they are set in order to accomplish
      specific public policy goals.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19] </em></strong></font>They
      can be no less efficient, however, when responsibly instituted.</p>
  <p>Governments face the challenge of knowing which of the tools at their disposal &#8212; command-and-control
      approaches or &quot;pricing&quot; approaches &#8212; will best serve effective
      and efficient achievement of public policies. Only in recent years, however,
      has there been a renewed interest in fiscal levers to achieve goals that policymakers
      seek to achieve. There is particular interest among students of welfare economics
      in incorporating costs earlier regarded as externalities, especially in designing
      environmental policies. Moreover, the use of pricing approaches to recover
      costs of government services that have a high level of private good about them
      can bring about more attractive and achievable goals than reliance on conventional
      police power approaches. User fees, environmental fees, and other such fiscal
      tools have become more fascinating &#8212; at least to students of public policy &#8212; than
      conventional taxes.</p>
  <p>The renewed interest in fiscal approaches comes in recognition of the fact
      that traditional command-and-control approaches have not been successful. Government
      authority is far more effective at prohibiting and controlling than it is inducing
      and channeling.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[20]</em></strong></font> Three
      illustrations of failed command-and-control approaches will demonstrate this:
      zoning, urban growth boundaries, and altering (usually expanding) political
      jurisdictions. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Concerns about urban policies also raise questions about the current relevance
    of Georgist ideas. For example, it is pertinent to ask whether a more uniform
    land tax would encourage the more efficient utilisation of urban space. George
    argued that, in order to cover the costs of a higher rate of land tax, landowners
    would be forced to put their land to its most productive use, and could not
    afford to hold it idle. Here is a clear link with the modern concerns to
    discourage &#8216;urban sprawl&#8217; and to promote &#8216;urban consolidation.&#8217; To
    the extent that a higher land tax would encourage the development of more
    housing in existing urban areas, the pressures for housing development in
    outlying areas would be significantly reduced. This, in turn, could reduce
    the burgeoning demand for transport that is currently characteristic of large
    cities.</p>
  <p>Land tax also impacts on the politics of peripheral urban expansion. Currently,
    the prospect of huge capital gains resulting from decisions by local governments
    to rezone land from rural to urban acts as an incentive for landowners on
    the fringes of built-up areas to lobby for changes that will allow increased
    development. Hence, landowners push for rights to subdivision, irrespective
    of whether or not there is actual demand (Day, 1995: 3). By creaming off
    the gains from windfall increases in land values, land tax obviates this
    bias towards relentless urban expansion.</p>
  <p>However, the question remains: would a uniform land tax be sufficient to
    produce more efficient patterns of urban development? Or would there still
    be a need for direct land use controls? Land tax can certainly be a tool
    for discouraging the wasteful use of land. It tends to discourage people
    from purchasing excessive amounts of land or leaving it idle. However, it
    may also encourage the overdevelopment of land in order to produce the income
    stream necessary to pay the higher rate of tax.</p>
  <p>Critics of urban consolidation such as Patrick Troy (1996) have examined
    the potential problems of such overdevelopment, including a range of environmental
    impacts such as altered hydrological processes. It seems to be an overly
    bold claim that a Georgist land tax alone would be sufficient to achieve
    optimal urban development patterns. Land use controls a necessary adjunct
    to land tax - in setting minimum requirements for green space, for example.</p>
  <p>Local government planning controls are also important to prevent incompatibility
    of land uses, such the development of hazardous or unhealthy industrial activities
    adjacent to residential areas. Targeted decentralisation policies are a means
    of encouraging the further development of regional centres. Such policies
    can work in conjunction with land taxes to ease growth pressures in the larger
    cities, while addressing long-standing spatial, social and economic inequalities
    (Stilwell, 2000: 254-260). The desirability of promoting more decentralised
    regional development is consistent with a Georgist perspective, but not altogether
    compatible with the claim that land tax would facilitate urban consolidation.
    It seems clear that it &#8216;overburdens&#8217; land tax to expect it alone
    to produce the best spatial outcomes, taking account of all the economic,
    social and environmental issues involved in urban and regional policy. The
    various other policy instruments &#8211; including regulations relating to
    green space, zoning, and the provision of public infrastructure to pave the
    way for decentralisation &#8211; are important complements to land taxation.
    In other words, land tax is best regarded as a necessary but not sufficient
    condition for more effective spatial policy.... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read
