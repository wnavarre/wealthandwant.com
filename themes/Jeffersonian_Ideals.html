          <p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of
          Taxation</a> (1881 article)</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the
              Constitution of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of
              Independence. To insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare,
              to secure to each individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty,
              and the pursuit of happiness &#8212; these are the proper ends of government,
              and are therefore the ends which in every scheme of taxation should be
            kept in mind.</p>
            <p>As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
              limit. Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation,
              if the increased revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which
              could not be done, or could not be as well and economically done, by
              private agencies. Taxes could be lightened in the city of New York by
              dispensing with street-lamps and disbanding the police force. But would
              a reduction in taxation gained in this way be for the benefit of the
              people of New York and make New York a more desirable place to live in?
              Or if it should be found that heat and light could be conducted through
              the streets at public expense and supplied to each house at but a small
              fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual effort, or that
              the city railroads could be run at public expense so as to give every
              one transportation at very much less than it now costs the average resident,
              the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be increased
              burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York would
              become a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn
              taxation as bad merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose
              by constitutional provision, as in many of our States has been advocated,
              and in some of our States has been done, any restriction upon the amount
              of taxation. A restriction upon the incurring of public indebtedness
              is another matter. In nothing is the far-reaching statesmanship of Jefferson
              more clearly shown than in his proposition that all public obligations
              should be deemed void after a certain brief term &#8212; a proposition
              which he grounds upon the self-evident truth that the earth belongs in
              usufruct to the living, and that the dead have no control over it, and
              can give no title to any part of it. But restriction upon public debts
              is a very different thing from restriction upon the power of taxation,
              and reasons which urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor is increased
              taxation necessarily proof of governmental extravagance. Increase in
              taxation is in the order of social development, for the reason that social
              development tends to the doing of things collectively that in a ruder
              state are done individually, to the giving to government of new functions
              and the imposing of new duties. Our public schools and libraries and
              parks, our signal service and fish commissions and agricultural bureaus
            and grasshopper investigations, are evidences of this. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

          Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a> </p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Because
      George asserted, "We must make
      land common property," he is sometimes erroneously regarded as an
      advocate of land nationalization. But, as we have seen, he was nothing
      of the sort. </span>The expropriation of land makes it practically
      impossible to fairly compensate people for the improvements to land,
      which are their legitimate property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">George's system
      renders to the community what is due to the community, without doing
      any violence to the wealth that has been fairly earned by productive
      workers.</span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>Common property in land is sometimes discredited by equation
      with what
      Garrett Hardin calls "<span style="font-style: italic;">The Tragedy of
      the Commons.</span>" Referring to the common lands that were a major
      English institution until the mid-nineteenth century, Hardin describes
      the tendency of individuals, each rationally pursuing self-interest, to
      overgraze, denude, and use the commons as a cesspool. That which
      belongs to everybody in this sense is, indeed, in danger of being
      valued and maintained by nobody.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">enclosure movement</span>
      ultimately brought an end to this ecologically destructive process, but
      not without literally pushing people off the land, exacting a baneful
      price in human misery that might well be termed <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">"The Tragedy of the Enclosures." </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">George hit upon a way of securing the
      benefits of both commons and enclosures, while at the same time
      avoiding their evils. Land value taxation rectifies distribution so
      that all receive wealth in proportion to their contribution to its
      production. This liberates the economic system from exploiters who
      contribute little or nothing.</span> Apportioning the wealth pie fairly
      increases the incentive to increase the size of the pie. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The market becomes in
      practice what capitalist theory alleges it to be -- a profoundly
      cooperative process of voluntary exchange of goods and services. </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Paradoxical
      though it may seem, the only way the individual may be assured what
      properly belongs to him or her is for society to take what properly
      belongs to it: The ideal of Jeffersonian individualism requires for its
      actualization the socialization of rent.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Just as Marxists err in
      insisting that
      everything be socialized, extreme capitalists err in insisting that
      everything (even public parks and forests!) be privatized. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The middle way is to recognize
      society's claim to what nature and society create -- the value of land
      and its rent -- so that working people, including entrepreneurs, may
      claim their full share of what they create.</span> In this balanced
      approach can be found the authentic verities respectively inherent in
      socialism and individualism. </span><a

        3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>        The Idea of Birthrights</p>
      <p>John Locke&#8217;s response to royalty&#8217;s claim of divine right
        was the idea of everyone&#8217;s inherent right to life, liberty, and
        property. Thomas Jefferson, in drafting America&#8217;s Declaration of
        Independence, changed Locke&#8217;s trinity to life, liberty, and the
        pursuit of happiness. These, Jefferson and his collaborators agreed,
        are gifts from the creator that can&#8217;t be taken away. Put slightly
        differently, they&#8217;re universal birthrights.</p>
      <p>The Constitution and its amendments added meat to these elegant bones.
        They guaranteed such birthrights as free speech, due process, habeas
        corpus, speedy public trials, and secure homes and property. Wisely,
        the Ninth Amendment affirmed that &#8220;the enumeration in the Constitution,
        of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others
        retained by the people.&#8221; In that spirit, others have since been
        added.</p>
      <p>If we were to analyze the expansion of American birthrights, we&#8217;d
        see a series of waves. The first wave consisted of rights against the
        state. The second included rights against unequal treatment based on
        race, nationality, gender, or sexual orientation. The third wave &#8212; which,
        historically speaking, is just beginning &#8212; consists of rights not
        against things, but for things &#8212; free public education, collective
        bargaining for wages, security in old age. They can be thought of as
        rights necessary for the pursuit of happiness. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
