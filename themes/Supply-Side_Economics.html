            an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production

      <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have attempted
          to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have
          before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
          prices.</p>
      </div>
    <div align="left">To abolish these taxes would
      be to lift the whole enormous weight of taxation from productive industry.
      The needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory;
        the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship;
      the farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All
      would
        be free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed
        by the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The
        more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the
        state would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty,
        as enterprising as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall
        not
        be fined for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before; you
        shall not be taxed for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</div>
    <div align="left" >And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that
        lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth
        out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
        reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural
        reward. The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No
        one can keep to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the
        bad. Every productive enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake
        it, yields collateral advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree,
        his gain is that he gathers the fruit in its time and season. But in addition
        to his gain, there is a gain to the whole community. Others than the owner
        are benefited by the increased supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters
        fly far and wide; the rain which it helps to attract falls not alone on his
        field; and, even to the eye which rests upon it from a distance, it brings
        a sense of beauty. And so with everything else. The building of a house,
        a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others besides those who get the
        direct profits.</div>
    <div align="left" >Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts
        him to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his
        labor, and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that
        labor and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all
        may share. And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed
        in a definite and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take
        while leaving to labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity
        of production this would commensurately increase.</div>
    <div align="left" >
      <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the
          value or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
          of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
          one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from
          use would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
      </div>
    <div align="left"> </div> The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its
        death blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and millions
        of acres from which settlers are now shut out by high prices would be abandoned
        by their present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal terms. And this
        not merely on the frontiers, but within what are now considered well settled
        districts.</div>
    <blockquote>
      </div><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land cannot
              be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by all competent
              economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons untrained in economics.
              The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is that it cannot limit the supply
              of land. Landowners are presumably, before the tax is laid, charging
              all the rent they can get. There is nothing in a tax on the rental value
              of land to make tenants willing to pay more or to make land more difficult
              to hire. On the contrary, more land will be on the market, because of
              such a tax, rather than less, since the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding
              land out of use and unimproved for mere speculation. The competition
              of former vacant land speculators to get their land used will make land
              cheaper to rent rather than more expensive. And since only the net rent
              remaining after the tax is subtracted is capitalized into salable value,
        land will be very much cheaper to buy. H.G.B.</font></blockquote>
And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
        land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as
        agricultural land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep
        land from its most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for
        it than the use to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere
        that land had attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now, as
        a fine upon improvement, would operate to force improvement. Whoever planted
        an orchard, or sowed a field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory,
        no matter how costly, would have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept
        so much land idle.</div>

      <li>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <div align="left"> The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though

      <div align="left" style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional economists,
                      have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension of this
                      point. Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced that the
                      greater cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor man who is
                      trying to save enough from his earnings to buy a piece of land; for,
                      it is said, the higher taxes on the land after it is acquired, offset
                      the lower purchase price. What such objectors do not see is that
                      even if the lower price of land does no more than balance the higher
                      tax on it, (and this overlooks, for one thing, the discouragement
                      to speculation in land), the reduction or removal of other taxes
                      is all clear gain. It is easier to save in proportion as earnings
                      and commodities are relieved of taxation. It is easier to buy land,
                      because its selling price is lower, if the land is taxed. And although
                      the land, after its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can
                      this tax be fully paid out of the annual interest on the saving in
                      the purchase price, but also there is to be reckoned the saving in
                      taxes on buildings and other improvements and in whatever other taxes
                  are thus rendered unnecessary. H.G.B.</font></div>

        <p>Consider the effect of such
          a change upon the labor market. Competition would no longer be one-sided,
          as now. Instead of laborers competing with
            each other for employment, and in their competition cutting down
          wages to the point of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere
          be competing
          for
            laborers, and wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For

    <small>But we've always heard that tax
    destroys incentives. The news in
    Henry George is that we can tax all the rent out of land, and not one
    square foot will walk away, nor will God switch off the Creation. Man
    creates capital by saving; some Other Force created land, and
    sustains and serves it every day, undeterred by taxes. </small>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Nor will Georgist taxes leave
owners sulking on their land, but
the contrary. A 1983 <span style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>magazine
article calls them <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Higher
Taxes that Promote Development." </span>The fixed tax is levied on
land
value, based on opportunity cost. The owner uses land harder and
improves it more to meet a fixed tax; or sells, releasing surplus
land to those needing more space. Taxes stifle enterprise only if
they increase with enterprise.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Land
tax increases only with
opportunity cost, which is independent of the enterprise of the
owner. The only activity this tax impairs is withholding land from
use.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George's land tax promotes equity
toward the landless in at least
four ways:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small>it relieves them of taxes, to the extent
that landowners
pay more; 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>it supplies them with more goods and
services, as land is
used better; 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>it offers them jobs producing those goods
and services;
and 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>it offers them a better chance to acquire
land, as surpluses are
released to the market.</small></li>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is supply-side economics
with a kick. It works through tax
transformation rather than tax reduction; total tax revenue may rise
or fall, as a separate issue. We can raise taxes and stimulate supply
together; there is no hard choice between them. At the same time, it
is demand side economics: untaxing investment raises the marginal
after-tax return, which, to demand-siders, is the motor that drives
the macro-economy. George's program not only reconciles efficiency
and equity, it squares taxes and incentives. What more can we ask of
economic policy than to resolve stand-offs that have confused us, and
dead-locked constructive action, for generations?
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is an achievement on a par with
resolving Evolution and
Creation, except George's program is something we can do something
about. We can implement it as quickly as we unclog the cerebral
arteries and follow thought with action.&nbsp; <span

<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small>
<p><small>... Untaxing buildings obviously draws in outside capital,
which is
good locally, but is not capital formation to the whole economy. In
Keynesian models, higher income leads to higher saving, and does
create new capital. Supply-siders today worry more about raising the
rate of saving from any given income. In supply-side models it is
more important to increase the rate of saving, without depending
entirely on the Keynesian effect, where higher income raises saving.
Also, from the nationalist viewpoint, it is better to supply
investable funds from domestic savings, to minimize foreign
ownership. </small></p>
<p><small>Land taxation helps here, too. Land taxation, if heavy enough
to
count, lowers the investment value of land, through "tax
capitalization". There is a diminishing marginal utility of savings
to any wealth-holder, meaning the more you have, the less you need
more. With land devalued, those needing wealth seek substitute
assets to replace land in their portfolios. To acquire those
additional assets they must save more, and invest the savings in real
new capital, rather than land.</small></p>
<p><small>Thus, Georgist taxation meets the proper goals of supply-side
economics: raising output, and raising saving. It reconciles
supply-side economics with taxation by providing a mode of taxation
that stimulates instead of dragging down production and employment.

</div>
<p>Mason Gaffney: <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_PoICG.html">The
Partiality of Indexing Capital Gains</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We surely agree with Roberts et
al. that domestic capital
formation is a crying current need; and the means is to foster saving
and investing (but properly defined, as below). We also agree there
is a strong, bi-partisan case for raising investment flows of the
income-creating, work-activating kind. Here, however, we meet the
problem of distinguishing new capital from old assets, especially
land.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
is not formed, like capital,
by saving and investment;
land is not reproducible. For that very reason land tends to
appreciate, and therefore has to be a major source of what are
misleadingly called "capital" gains.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Again for that
very reason,
there is no supply-side kick in untaxing gains. Most of them are land
gains, and should be called that.</span> To use land as a store of
value is
macro-economically unproductive at best, and on balance
counterproductive and destabilizing (considering its effect on
financial institutions like the S&amp;Ls).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To handle this matter we need two
semantic distinctions
which often are lost in the word-fencing of debate. Walter Heller,
whose policies still enjoy bi-partisan support, thought and spoke in
a Keynesian framework where "investment" means "investing," an
affirmative, job-making action. It is a process, not a store of
value; an economic flow, not a fund. It is not the asset held: this
"investment" is a noun, macro-economically static and sterile. [<i>Land
may appreciate, and one may call this "investment," but the
appreciation employs no one and creates no new wealth (although it may
reflect the externalities of wealth created by others).</i>]</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To
signalize these differences I use the present participle "investing,"
rather than the ambiguous noun "investment."&nbsp;<b> </b><i
 style="font-style: italic;">[Webster's 9th New Collegiate defines
investment both ways: it is an action, (the Keynesian usage); it is
also an asset being held, a store of value. Such a two-faced word is a
natural medium for double-talk, and has been so exploited, to the
detriment of general understanding.</i><span style="font-style: italic;">]</span><b>
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Every Keynesian also knew in 1961
that investment means net,
positive-sum investing. It does not include buying and selling
existing assets like land: these are zero-sum transactions,
macro-economically non-functional and barren. [Keynes, although
careless of consistency, generally took care to distinguish old and new
assets. " ... the competition of a high interest-rate on mortgages may
well have had the same effect in retarding the growth of wealth from
current investment in newly produced capital-assets as high interest
rates on long-term debts ... " <small>[<i>General Theory, 1936, p.
241.] The old macro-economists generally refer to investing in newly
produced assets as "income- creating expenditure," which is clear and
correct, but too much of a mouthful.</i>]</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I use "investing" only
in the sense of net, income-creating, job-making spending.<small> [<i>Note
the difference between real turnover and mere ownership turnover.
Ownership turnover generates no income (except for brokers and M&amp;A
personnel) and creates no capital. Real turnover also creates no
capital, but does forward supplies of goods to consume, and flows of
investing to produce replacement goods. Most of gross investing is
reinvesting funds received or anticipated from sales of old capital
(including inventories, which turn fast, and "fixed" capital which
turns slowly as it depreciates and the funds are reinvested).</i>]<b>
</b></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to
borrowing on land, that can be worse than barren when the financial
system rises and falls on a land bubble, as it has and is.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Heller and his contemporaries
also knew that the incentive
driving job-making investing is <span style="font-weight: bold;">MRORAT,
the Marginal Rate of Return
after Taxes. </span><small>[<i>Economists of the 1960s, following
Keynes, called it the MEC, or "Marginal Efficiency of Capital," an
awkward phrase now little used. Awkward or not, and intended or not, it
had great historical consequence by putting the emphasis where it
belongs, on marginal rates of return, excluding rents.</i>]</small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The marginal idea is pivotal. The
Average ROR includes
rents; the Marginal ROR is the pure return to new investment, Keynes'
"inducement to invest," which is activating and functional.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These Heller ideas were invoked
again by supply-siders in
early Reagan times. However, policy over the course of the 80s lost
the substance of that policy, keeping only the guise. Domestic
leaders forgot the usage of "investment" in macro-economics. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They
gradually slipped into an illusion that buying and holding and
bidding up old assets like non-reproduceable lands and stocks would
make jobs and produce goods. They forgot to distinguish old from new
assets, and marginal from average returns on investment (average
returns, recall, include rents). Both critics and supporters of
"supply-side" policies now darken counsel by debating current
policies in supply-side terms, when the terms no longer describe the
policy at issue.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Along with normal confusion,
there is intelligence behind
such error. The case for downtaxing gains depends in part on
exploiting confusion, in order to pass off rent-raising as an
incentive for saving and investing, and so to disguise its
non-functionality and eminent taxability. The policy is called
"supply side," but isn't. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The litmus test of the sincerity
of capital-formation champions is
their treatment of irreproduceable land. Raising rents and land
prices, and protecting the gains from taxation, is purely
distributive, with no power to foster saving and investing. On the
contrary, a higher share for rent and/or land purchase must mean a
lower share for the investor in new capital.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Ignoring land and its distinctive
attributes has the effect
of treating land as though it were true, reproduceable capital, to be
formed by saving and investing, to be routinely worn out and replaced
in the normal course of life and business. It lets advocates of
investing and capital formation abuse the legitimate case for macro
incentives, exploiting the case to camouflage unearned, nonfunctional
rents and increments to land value.[<i>Brookings' major contribution to
our subject is Henry Aaron (ed), 1976, Inflation and the Income Tax,
with chapters by 15 eminent economists. Land is treated by none and is
not in the index. [It is mentioned in passing only by one, George Lent.]</i>]&nbsp;

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">Neo-classical
Economics as a Stratagem Against Henry George</a><br>
<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Voters faced with two
candidates, each coached by a neo-classical economist, also face a hard
choice. They often appear apathetic and take a third choice, staying
home. However, history denies that voters are intrinsically apathetic.
They have gotten turned on by candidates who try to lead up and away
from dismal trade-offs.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>In 1980 it was Ronald Reagan. Instead of the dismal Phillips
Curve ("choose inflation or unemployment") he offered the happy Laffer
Curve: lower tax rates would lead to higher supplies, higher revenues,
and lower deficits, he promised. Lowering taxes, said Laffer, would
eliminate the "wedge effect." He often cited Henry George in support of
his position.4 Thus he would unleash supply, and collect more taxes
while applying lower tax rates. The voters were sick of 2nd-generation
Keynesians who had been reduced to preaching austerity, so they were
game (if not wise) to buy into Reaganomics as advertised.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Unfortunately, the Laffer Curve turned out to be wildly
overoptimistic, and Reaganomics partly fraudulent and hypocritical5 in
application. The voters again tuned out and seemed apathetic. They are
not saying, however, they don't care. They are saying "come back when
you have something better, mean what you say, and deliver what you
promise."&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The only shifting of a land tax is negative. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">By negative shifting I mean that the
supply-side effects of taxing land will raise supplies of goods and
services, and raise the demand for labor, thus raising the bargaining
power of median people in the marketplace, both as consumers and
workers. </span>This effect makes the tax doubly progressive: it
undercuts the holdout power and bargaining power of landowners
vis-a-vis workers, and also vis-a- vis new investors in real capital.
This effect also makes the land tax doubly efficient. ... <a

in a Tax-free Society</a>&nbsp; (Outline of remarks by Mason Gaffney,
for use at Moscow Congress,
5/21/96)&nbsp;
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent
will become huger yet when
you abate taxes
presently levied on production and exchange, because these now
depress the rent of land. </span>That is, in a tax-free market
economy, the
benefit of abating present taxes will lodge mainly in land rents. The
taxable surplus simply shifts from one form to another.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This is more than a simple shift
of a fixed amount. When you
substitute land revenues for existing taxes, the surplus actually
grows, as if by synergy. You gain more revenue base than you lose,
because existing taxes now suppress much latent production. Payroll
taxes directly drive workers from taxable jobs to untaxed gains from
crime. Abating those taxes will unleash suppressed economic giants,
along with all the new surplus values their latent production will
generate. "Monetarists" warn you that "there are no free lunches." In
fact, however, good policy creates lots of "free lunches." It makes
the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Imagine the benefits,
alone, of turning people from destructive careers in crime to useful
jobs producing goods.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> At the same time, the effect of
socializing land revenues is
to stimulate better land use - the opposite of the effect of existing
taxes. Every landowner, to pay the required land charge, is pushed to
steer his land to the best use (just as paying interest steers
capital to its best use). Thus, the shift to rent-based revenues
doubly induces new production: it releases the brake of present
taxes, and replaces it with an added push to produce. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">This is
"supply-side economic policy" in the best and truest sense. It
generates yet more surplus. You may take all of rent to support
government functions, without damaging private market incentives, but
only sharpening them.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
This policy lets us achieve and
reconcile two policies that
many now believe are incompatible, viz.: free markets, and common
rights in land. </span>It is a kind of miracle, yet simple to
understand and
implement. Monetarist advisers would bind you in a dilemma: they
claim you must choose between private markets and common rights. In
fact, you may have both at once. Public revenue is simply the kind of
socialization that occurs in a market economy. Socialize the rent of
land, and you socialize the net benefits of owning land, even while
privatizing the management of land, and gaining the benefits of using
free markets.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The combined effect of all this
stimulus would be a burst of
growth such as few economies have ever shown, except in wartime. We
learned in the U.S.A. in World War II the astounding effects of
simply taking the brakes off production. U.S. GNP doubled, 1941-43;
all willing workers were fully employed. This same miracle can occur
in Russia, 1996-98. The natural resources and human talent are here:
you only need the right incentive structure to turn labor from
idleness and crime to producing goods and services.... <a

<blockquote>
      <p>Even if land value taxation does not yield the revenue that is desired,
          this is no argument against shifting as much public revenue as possible
          to rent-based sources. Public revenue from land values is the most

        policy attempts to increase production and the supply of goods by decreasing
        costs,
          such as by lowering taxes and eliminating excessive regulations and
        barriers to trade. A complete tax shift, away from taxing production
        to taxing land
          values, is the ultimate supply-side policy, since it removes the excess
          economic burden of taxation. The public collection of land rent is
        thus the ultimate in tax reform.</p>
      <p>Land value taxation would also result in a substantial reduction in the
          cost of government. The administrative cost of land value taxes would be
          less than that of existing property taxes (which require a greater inspection
          of buildings and improvements), and the cost of enforcing income and sales
          taxes would be eliminated. By improving economic growth and allowing workers
          to keep all the money they earn, land value taxation would result in higher
          incomes, reducing the demand for government welfare programs. Decentralization,
          privatization, and the elimination of wasteful government programs would
          further reduce the amount needed to fund government. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>
