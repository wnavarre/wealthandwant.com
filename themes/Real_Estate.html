<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wrong! Suppose this layman writer
and the Oregon Chief Justice
were in error, and water permits were real property. That is out of
the frying pan, into the fire. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>What does 'real' mean, applied
to property or estate? It is not
the opposite of 'imaginary.' No, 'real' is an elided English form of
the French 'regal' taken into English when English kings spoke their
native French. <i>Real property is The King's. </i></b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We threw out kings in 1783, but
not the royal powers. Rather, we
transferred those powers to our State governments. By succession,
real property means government property! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Every landowner is a tenant of the
king or his successors in
interest. <b>The very word 'own' comes from 'owe.' An owner is one
who owes. What he owed historically was fealty to his sovereign.
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That used to mean bending the
knee, kissing the royal foot,
swearing allegiance, and showing up on demand to smite the enemy.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>It has evolved into servitudes
like eminent domain, police
power, the public trust doctrine, and something else that our lawyers

</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These concepts are basic to common
law which has been brought into
every U.S. state constitution (save Louisiana's). Moses was not just
whistling Dixie when he quoted The Lord as saying "The land shall not

Revive a Dying City</a><small><b><br>
</b></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Building investment exhibits
diminishing marginal
productivity.
For example, the first $10K spent yields 30%, or $3K; but $1K (10%)
is paid in interest, leaving a $2K surplus. To acquire a superior
location that confers this surplus, the buyer can spend up to $2K
annually, which means paying up to $20K for the land (at 10%, $20K
costs $2K/year). The next $10K spent may yield more than 10% too, say
20%, conferring more surplus and adding more value to the land. The
idea is to invest until the last $10K unit yields 10%, just enough to
pay interest. To understand
ground rents and land prices is to
understand cities; not to understand is to remain mired forever in
confusion and fallacy. Ground rent continues forever, generally
tending to rise; therefore, to buy title to land, people pay prices
that look high relative to current cash flows. In Riverside, a
low
density city of 208,000, land prices go up to $18/sf. In San
Francisco, with high density and 800,000 people, prices reach
$1,000/sf; in Manhattan they exceed $2,000. In Tokyo, probably the
top of the line, one sale is reported at $25,000/sf. <span

prices take your breath away.</span></small>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land prices vary extremely from
city to city or block to block.
The cost to build a square foot of floor space is fairly constant
from place to place, but demand varies with location. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A small
rise in
floor rental translates into a large rise in ground rent and land
price, because the land owner gets everything above what is required
to operate and amortize the building.</span> Thus,</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small>in Riverside,
neighborhood mall space rental of $12 just pays for the building,
with only a little left over, resulting in land prices of perhaps
$5-$8/sf.

  <small> </small><li><small>In Manhattan, rentals are triple those in
Riverside; <span

surplus accrues to ground rent, resulting in land prices 300 times
higher than in Riverside.</span></small></li>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At key locations in bigger cities,
land prices are not just high
per square foot, they are higher per capita than in small cities.
They are even higher relative to building values, in spite of the
high-rise buildings. Remember that each additional floor adds more
ground rent, because floor space rental is more than enough to cover
the added cost.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Another attractive feature of
        land taxation is its interesting positive effect on the economic base
        of a city. It strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder
        than resident owners.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The
        land fraction in real estate is generally highest in the CBD of any city,
        so that is a favorite place for absentees to buy and hold. They like
        the steady income, and the "trophy" quality. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
        surplus in real estate is what attracts outside buyers, and land is what

    <br>
    <small><b>Hiding the free
      lunch</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil wins at the point where he
      convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
      Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
      kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
      invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
      mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well,
      breathlessly focused on their own
      particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
    land-price gains has become invisible.</span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
      are
      out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
      than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
      on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
    the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small>
</div>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
that no free lunch exists. But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two appraisal
methods</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways.
Both start by estimating its
market value.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of
buildings from this overall value, designating the remainder as the
value of land. Building values may be estimated in terms of their
replacement cost (which usually produces a very high estimate, leaving
little land value) or their depreciated value (which gives an
unrealistically low building estimate, inasmuch as maintenance and
repairs save most buildings from deteriorating through wear and tear).
Using the depreciated value method leaves a higher residual land value.
The Federal Reserve Board recently has experimented with a hybrid
intermediate method that values buildings on the basis of their
"historical costs".</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing
the land,
and treats the difference as representing the building's value. The
first step in this approach is to construct a land-value map for the
district or city. This displays fairly smooth contours for land values.
Overlays would show zoning variations. Most of the variations in
property prices around this normalized map will be for structures,
along with a sizable component of "errors and omissions." This approach
rarely is used, and most assessed land values vary drastically from one
parcel to the next. The problem is especially apparent in the case of
parking lots or one-story "taxpayers," that is, inexpensive buildings
in neighbourhoods that are heavily built up. Their purpose is simply to
be rented out at enough to carry the property's tax bill, not to
maximise the site's current economic value.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
appraisal methods do not
acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
changed in comparison to the property's overall value?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve
multiplies the building's original cost by the
rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is agreed that any
explanation of land/building relations
should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
<b><i>uniform</i></b> and <b><i>homogeneous</i></b> as possible. By
that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
accordingly.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
accepted, then I believe that economists
would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
opposite usually is done.
</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE DRIVING
FORCE behind the anomalies is the political lobbying
eager to depict real estate gains simply as "protecting capital from
inflation." In reality, it helps land owners and their creditors get
a free ride out of land asset-price inflation -- that is, The
Bubble.&nbsp;</small> ...<small></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>SUMMARY</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For hundreds of years property's
value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental
stream will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more
years' rent a property will bring. What is so striking about land
values today is that they are rising for reasons independent of their
earnings stream. The major new consideration is their prospect for
future "capital" (that is, land-price) gains. In sum, the ultimate
aim of real estate investors no longer is so much to seek income --
most of which is pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the
property they acquire -- as much as to seek property gains.
Politically opportunites abound. <b>Merely changing zoning in New
York City in the 1980s to allow using commercial loft spaces for
residential purposes had the effect of multiplying asset values five
or tenfold.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether the gains come from
selling the property or from borrowing
more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
the strategies they developed over the past half century.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nationwide
the capital-gains dimension needs to be incorporated
into the rental revenue statistics to measure real estate's total
returns. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sector's
nearly complete success in escaping the tax
collector has placed an enormous tax burden on everyone else.</span></b>&nbsp;

    with the search for one place that is better than another, he stops &#8212; somewhere,
    anywhere &#8212; and starts to make himself a home. The soil is virgin and
    rich, game is abundant, the streams flash with the finest trout. Nature is
    at her very best. He has what, were he in a populous district, would make
    him rich; but he is very poor. To say nothing of the mental craving, which
    would lead him to welcome the sorriest stranger, he labors under all the
    material disadvantages of solitude. He can get no temporary assistance for
    any work that requires a greater union of strength than that afforded by
    his own family, or by such help as he can permanently keep. Though he has
    cattle, he cannot often have fresh meat, for to get a beefsteak he must kill
    a bullock. He must be his own blacksmith, wagonmaker, carpenter, and cobbler &#8212; in
    short, a "jack of all trades and master of none." He cannot have his children
    schooled, for, to do so, he must himself pay and maintain a teacher. Such
    things as he cannot produce himself, he must buy in quantities and keep on
    hand, or else go without, for he cannot be constantly leaving his work and
    making a long journey to the verge of civilization; and when forced to do
    so, the getting of a vial of medicine or the replacement of a broken auger
    may cost him the labor of himself and horses for days. Under such circumstances,
    though nature is prolific, the man is poor. It is an easy matter for him
    to get enough to eat; but beyond this, his labor will suffice to satisfy
    only the simplest wants in the rudest way. </p>
  <p>Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section* of the
    boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he is not beset
    by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the land is the same,
    there is one place that is clearly better for him than any other place, and
    that is where there is already a settler and he may have a neighbor. He settles
    by the side of the first comer, whose condition is at once greatly improved,
    and to whom many things are now possible that were before impossible, for
    two men may help each other to do things that one man could never do.<font size="-1"></font></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">*The public prairie lands of
      the United States were surveyed into sections of one mile square, and a
      quarter section (160 acres) was the usual government allotment to a settler
      under the Homestead Act. </font><br>
          <br>
  </div>
  Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction, settles where
  there are already two. Another, and another, until around our first comer there
  are a score of neighbors. Labor has now an effectiveness which, in the solitary
  state, it could not approach. If heavy work is to be done, the settlers have
  a logrolling, and together accomplish in a day what singly would require years.
  When one kills a bullock, the others take part of it, returning when they kill,
  and thus they have fresh meat all the time. Together they hire a schoolmaster,
  and the children of each are taught for a fractional part of what similar teaching
  would have cost the first settler. It becomes a comparatively easy matter to
  send to the nearest town, for some one is always going. But there is less need
  for such journeys. A blacksmith and a wheelwright soon set up shops, and our
  settler can have his tools repaired for a small part of the labor it formerly
  cost him. A store is opened and he can get what he wants as he wants it; a
  postoffice, soon added, gives him regular communication with the rest of the
  world. Then come a cobbler, a carpenter, a harness maker, a doctor; and a little
  church soon arises. Satisfactions become possible that in the solitary state
  were impossible. There are gratifications for the social and the intellectual
  nature &#8212; for that part of the man that rises above the animal. The power
  of sympathy, the sense of companionship, the emulation of comparison and contrast,
  open a wider, and fuller, and more varied life. In rejoicing, there are others
  to rejoice; in sorrow, the mourners do not mourn alone. There are husking bees,
  and apple parings, and quilting parties. Though the ballroom be unplastered
  and the orchestra but a fiddle, the notes of the magician are yet in the strain,
  and Cupid dances with the dancers. At the wedding, there are others to admire
  and enjoy; in the house of death, there are watchers; by the open grave, stands
  human sympathy to sustain the mourners. Occasionally, comes a straggling lecturer
  to open up glimpses of the world of science, of literature, or of art; in election
  times, come stump speakers, and the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and
  power, as the cause of empires is tried before him in the struggle of John
  Doe and Richard Roe for his support and vote. And, by and by, comes the circus,
  talked of months before, and opening to children whose horizon has been the
  prairie, all the realms of the imagination &#8212; princes and princesses of
  fairy tale, mailclad crusaders and turbaned Moors, Cinderella's fairy coach,
  and the giants of nursery lore; lions such as crouched before Daniel, or in
  circling Roman amphitheater tore the saints of God; ostriches who recall the
  sandy deserts; camels such as stood around when the wicked brethren raised
  Joseph from the well and sold him into bondage; elephants such as crossed the
  Alps with Hannibal, or felt the sword of the Maccabees; and glorious music
  that thrills and builds in the chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome
  of Kubla Khan.
    <p>Go to our settler now, and say to him: "You have so many fruit trees which
      you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a house &#8212; in short,
      you have by your labor added so much value to this farm. Your land itself
      is not quite so good. You have been cropping it, and by and by it will
      need manure. I will give you the full value of all your improvements if
      you will give it to me, and go again with your family beyond the verge
      of settlement." He would laugh at you. His land yields no more wheat or
      potatoes than before, but it does yield far more of all the necessaries
      and comforts of life. His labor upon it will bring no heavier crops, and,
      we will suppose, no more valuable crops, but it will bring far more of
      all the other things for which men work. The presence of other settlers &#8212; the
      increase of population &#8212; has added to the productiveness, in these
      things, of labor bestowed upon it, and this added productiveness gives
      it a superiority over land of equal natural quality where there are as
      yet no settlers. If no land remains to be taken up, except such as is as
      far removed from population as was our settler's land when he first went
      upon it, the value or rent of this land will be measured by the whole of
      this added capability. If, however, as we have supposed, there is a continuous
      stretch of equal land, over which population is now spreading, it will
      not be necessary for the new settler to go into the wilderness, as did
      the first. He will settle just beyond the other settlers, and will get
      the advantage of proximity to them. The value or rent of our settler's
      land will thus depend on the advantage which it has, from being at the
      center of population, over that on the verge. In the one case, the margin
      of production will remain as before; in the other, the margin of production
      will be raised.</p>
    <p>Population still continues to increase, and as it increases so do the
      economies which its increase permits, and which in effect add to the productiveness
      of the land. Our first settler's land, being the center of population,
      the store, the blacksmith's forge, the wheelwright's shop, are set up on
      it, or on its margin, where soon arises a village, which rapidly grows
      into a town, the center of exchanges for the people of the whole district.
      With no greater agricultural productiveness than it had at first, this
      land now begins to develop a productiveness of a higher kind. To labor
      expended in raising corn, or wheat, or potatoes, it will yield no more
      of those things than at first; but to labor expended in the subdivided
      branches of production which require proximity to other producers, and,
      especially, to labor expended in that final part of production, which consists
      in distribution, it will yield much larger returns. The wheatgrower may
      go further on, and find land on which his labor will produce as much wheat,
      and nearly as much wealth; but the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper,
      the professional man, find that their labor expended here, at the center
      of exchanges, will yield them much more than if expended even at a little
      distance away from it; and this excess of productiveness for such purposes
      the landowner can claim just as he could an excess in its wheat-producing
      power. And so our settler is able to sell in building lots a few of his
      acres for prices which it would not bring for wheatgrowing if its fertility
      had been multiplied many times. With the proceeds, he builds himself a
      fine house, and furnishes it handsomely. That is to say, to reduce the
      transaction to its lowest terms, the people who wish to use the land build
      and furnish the house for him, on condition that he will let them avail
      themselves of the superior productiveness which the increase of population
      has given the land.</p>
    <p>Population still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater utility
      to the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town has grown
      into a city &#8212; a St. Louis, a Chicago or a San Francisco &#8212; and
      still it grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with
      the best machinery and the most favorable facilities; the division of labor
      becomes extremely minute, wonderfully multiplying efficiency; exchanges
      are of such volume and rapidity that they are made with the minimum of
      friction and loss. Here is the heart, the brain, of the vast social organism
      that has grown up from the germ of the first settlement; here has developed
      one of the great ganglia of the human world. Hither run all roads, hither
      set all currents, through all the vast regions round about. Here, if you
      have anything to sell, is the market; here, if you have anything to buy,
      is the largest and the choicest stock. Here intellectual activity is gathered
      into a focus, and here springs that stimulus which is born of the collision
      of mind with mind. Here are the great libraries, the storehouses and granaries
      of knowledge, the learned professors, the famous specialists. Here are
      museums and art galleries, collections of philosophical apparatus, and
      all things rare, and valuable, and best of their kind. Here come great
      actors, and orators, and singers, from all over the world. Here, in short,
      is a center of human life, in all its varied manifestations.</p>
    <p>So enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the application
      of labor, that instead of one man &#8212; with a span of horses scratching
      over acres, you may count in places thousands of workers to the acre, working
      tier on tier, on floors raised one above the other, five, six, seven and
      eight stories from the ground, while underneath the surface of the earth
      engines are throbbing with pulsations that exert the force of thousands
      of horses. </p>
    <p><b>All these advantages attach to the land; it is on this land and no
        other that they can be utilized, for here is the center of population &#8212; the
        focus of exchanges, the market place and workshop of the highest forms
        of industry.</b> The productive powers which density of population has
        attached to this land are equivalent to the multiplication of its original
        fertility by the hundredfold and the thousandfold. And rent, which measures
        the difference between this added productiveness and that of the least
        productive land in use, has increased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever
        has succeeded to his right to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another <a name="Rip Van Winkle"></a>Rip
        Van Winkle, he may have lain down and slept; still he is rich &#8212; not
        from anything he has done, but from the increase of population. There
        are lots from which for every foot of frontage the owner may draw more
        than an average mechanic can earn; there are lots that will sell for
        more than would suffice to pave them with gold coin. In the principal
        streets are towering buildings, of granite, marble, iron, and plate glass,
        finished in the most expensive style, replete with every convenience.
        Yet they are not worth as much as the land upon which they rest &#8212; the
        same land, in nothing changed, which when our first settler came upon
        it had no value at all.</p>
    <p>That this is the way in which the increase of population powerfully acts
      in increasing rent, whoever, in a progressive country, will look around
      him, may see for himself. The process is going on under his eyes. The increasing
      difference in the productiveness of the land in use, which causes an increasing
      rise in rent, results not so much from the necessities of increased population
      compelling the resort to inferior land, as from the increased productiveness
      which increased population gives to the lands already in use. <b>The most
      valuable lands on the globe, the lands which yield the highest rent, are
      not lands of surpassing natural fertility, but lands to which a surpassing
      utility has been given by the increase of population.</b></p>
    <p>The increase of productiveness or utility which increase of population
      gives to certain lands, in the way to which I have been calling attention,
      attaches, as it were, to the mere quality of extension. The valuable quality
      of land that has become a center of population is its superficial capacity &#8212; it
      makes no difference whether it is fertile, alluvial soil like that of Philadelphia,
      rich bottom land like that of New Orleans; a filled-in marsh like that
      of St. Petersburg, or a sandy waste like the greater part of San Francisco.</p>
    <p><b>And where value seems to arise from superior natural qualities, such
        as deep water and good anchorage, rich deposits of coal and iron, or
        heavy timber, observation also shows that these superior qualities are
        brought out, rendered tangible, by population. </b>The coal and iron
        fields of Pennsylvania, that today [1879] are worth enormous sums, were
        fifty years ago valueless. What is the efficient cause of the difference?
        Simply the difference in population. The coal and iron beds of Wyoming
        and Montana, which today are valueless, will, in fifty years from now,
        be worth millions on millions, simply because, in the meantime, population
        will have greatly increased.</p>
    <p>It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If
      the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch
      and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. <b><i>And
      very great command over the services of others comes to those who as the
      hatches are opened are permitted to say, "This is mine!" ... <em><a href="../HG/PP/SP/03_Rent_Grows.htm">read
