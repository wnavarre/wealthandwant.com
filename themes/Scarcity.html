<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Thou shalt not steal"; that is the law of God. What does it mean? Well,
    it does not merely mean that you shall not pick pockets! It does not merely
    mean that you shall not commit burglary or highway robbery! There are other
    forms of stealing which it prohibits as well. It certainly means (if it has
    any meaning) that we shall not take that to which we are not entitled, to
    the detriment of others.</p>
  <p>Now, here is a desert. Here is a caravan going along over the desert. Here
    is a gang of robbers. They say: "Look! There is a rich caravan; let us go
    and rob it, kill the men if necessary, take their goods from them, their
    camels and horses, and walk off." But one of the robbers says:&nbsp; "Oh,
    no; that is dangerous; besides, that would be stealing! <strong>Let us, instead
    of doing that, go ahead to where there is a spring, the only spring at which
    this caravan can get water in this desert. Let us put a wall around it and
    call it ours, and when they come up we won&#8217;t let them have any water
    until they have given us all the goods they have." That would be more gentlemanly,
    more polite, and more respectable; but would it not be theft all the same?</strong>    And is it not theft of the same kind when people go ahead in advance of population
    and get land they have no use whatever for, and then, as people come into
    the world and population increases, will not let this increasing population
    use the land until they pay an exorbitant price? </p>
  <p>That is the sort of theft on which our first families are founded.
      Do that under the false code of morality which exists here today and people
      will praise your forethought and your enterprise, and will say you have
      made money because you are a very superior person, and that all can make
      money if they will only work and be industrious! But is it not as clearly
      a violation of the command: "Thou shalt not steal," as taking the money
      out of a person&#8217;s pocket?</p>
  <p>"Thou shalt not steal." That means, of course, that we ourselves must not
    steal. But does it not also mean that we must not suffer anybody else to
    steal if we can help it?</p>
  <p>"Thou shalt not steal." Does it not also mean: "Thou shalt not suffer thyself
    or anybody else to be stolen from?" If it does, then we, all of us, rich
    and poor alike, are responsible for this social crime that produces poverty.
    Not merely the people who monopolize the land &#8212; they are not to blame
    above anyone else, but we who permit them to monopolize land are also parties
    to the theft.<b> </b>... <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">read the whole

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When there is famine among
savages it is because food enough is
not to be had. But this was not the case in Ireland. In any part of
Ireland, during the height of what was called the famine, there was
food enough for whoever had means to pay for it. The trouble was not
in the scarcity of food. There was, as a matter of fact, no real
scarcity of food, and the proof of it is that food did not command
scarcity prices. During all the so-called famine, food was constantly
exported from Ireland to England, which would not have been the case
had there been true famine in one country any more than in the other.
During all the so-called famine a practically unlimited supply of
American meat and grain could have been poured into Ireland, through
the existing mechanism of exchange, so quickly that the relief would
have been felt instantaneously. Our sending of supplies in a national
war-ship was a piece of vulgar ostentation, fitly paralleled by their
ostentatious distribution in British gunboats under the nominal
superintendence of a royal prince. Had we been bent on relief, not
display, we might have saved our government the expense of fitting up
its antiquated warship, the British gunboats their coal, the Lord
Mayor his dinner, and the Royal Prince his valuable time. A cable
draft, turned in Dublin into postal orders, would have afforded the
relief, not merely much more easily and cheaply, but in less time
than it took our war-ship to get ready to receive her cargo; for the
reason that so many of the Irish people were starving was, not that
the food was not to be had, but that they had not the means to buy
it. Had the Irish people had money or its equivalent, the bad seasons
might have come and gone without stinting any one of a full meal.
Their effect would merely have been to determine toward Ireland the
flow of more abundant harvests. </small><small>... <a

The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back
to the Land</a> (1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Price of Land a Monopoly
Price.</b>
</small><br>
<small>This privileged class not merely sells the use of God's gifts,
but
extorts for them a price which is most unjust and exorbitant; in
fact, they hardly ever sell them at less than scarcity or famine
prices. If a man wants to buy a suit of broadcloth, the price he will
be required to pay for it will amount to very little more than what
it cost to produce it -- and yet that suit of clothes may be a
requirement of such necessity or utility to him that he would
willingly pay three times the amount it actually cost rather than
submit to the inconvenience of doing without it. On the other hand,
the manufacturer would extort the last shilling he would be willing
to give for it, only that he knows there are scores of other
manufacturers ready to undersell him if he demanded much more than
the cost of its production. The price, therefore, of commodities of
all kinds that can be produced on a large scale, and to an indefinite
extent, will depend on the cost required to produce them, or at least
that part of them which is produced at the highest expense.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But there is a limited class of
commodities whose selling price
has no relation or dependence at all on the cost at which they have
been produced; for example, rare wines that grow only on soils of
limited extent; paintings by the old masters; statues at exquisite
beauty and finish by celebrated sculptors; rare books, bronzes and
medals, and provisions or articles of human food in cities during a
siege, and more generally in times of scarcity and famine -- these
commodities are limited in quantity, and it is physically impossible
in the circumstances existing to increase, multiply, or augment them
further. The seller of these commodities, not being afraid of
competition, can put any price he pleases on them short of the
purchasers' extreme estimate of the necessity, utility, or advantage
to themselves of such commodities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Fabulous sums of money, therefore,
have been expended in the
purchase of such commodities -- sometimes to indulge a taste for the
fine arts; sometimes to satisfy a passion for the rare and the
beautiful; and, sometimes, too, to gratify a feeling of vanity or
ambition to be the sole proprietors of objects of antiquarian
interest and curiosity. On the other hand, enormous sums of money
have been paid in times of scarcity or during a siege for the
commonest necessaries of life, or, failing these, for substitutes
that have been requisitioned for human food, the use of which would
make one shudder in circumstances of less pressing necessity.&nbsp; <a

Unemployed</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1894)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small>AN EPIDEMIC of what passes for
      charity is sweeping over the land. <strong>...</strong></small>
        </div>
        <small>Yet there has been no disaster of
      fire or flood, no convulsion of
      nature, no destruction by public enemies. The seasons have kept their
      order, we have had the former and the latter rain, and the earth has
      not refused her increase. Granaries are filled to overflowing, and
      commodities, even these we have tried to make dear by tariff, were
      never before so cheap.</small>
      </p>
  <p>
    </p>
    <small>The scarcity that is distressing
        and frightening the whole country
        is a scarcity of employment. It is the unemployed for whom charity is
        asked: not those who cannot or will not work, but those able to work
        and anxious to work, who, through no fault of their own, cannot find
        work. So clear, indeed, is it that of the great masses who are
        suffering in this country to-day, by far the greater part are honest,
        sober, and industrious, that the pharisees who preach that poverty is
        due to laziness and thriftlessness, and the fanatics who attribute it
        to drink, are for the moment silent. </small>        </p>
  <p><small>Yet why is it that men able to
      work and willing to work cannot
      find work? It is not strange that the failure to work should bring
      want, for it is only by work that human wants are satisfied. But to
      say that widespread distress comes from widespread inability to find
      employment no more explains the distress than to say that the man
      died from want of breath explains a sudden death. The pressing
      question, the real question, is, What causes the want of
      employment? <strong>...</strong></small>      </p>
  <p><small>What more unnatural than that alms
        should be asked, not for the
        maimed, the halt and the blind, the helpless widow and the tender
        orphan, but for grown men, strong men, skilful men, men able to work
        and anxious to work! What more unnatural than that labor -- the
        producer of all food, all clothing, all shelter -- should not be
        exchangeable for its full equivalent in food, clothing, and shelter;
        that while the things it produces have value, labor, the giver of all
        value, should seem valueless!</small>        </p>
  <p><small>Here are men, having the natural
      wants of man, having the natural
      powers of man -- powers adapted and intended and more than sufficient
      to supply those wants. To say that they are willing to use their
      powers for the satisfaction of their wants, yet cannot do so, is to
      say that there is a wrong. If it is not their fault, whose fault is
      it? Wrong somewhere there must be.<strong> ...</strong></small>      </p>
  <p><small>Why should charity be offered the
        unemployed? It is not alms they
        ask. They are insulted and embittered and degraded by being forced to
        accept as paupers what they would gladly earn as workers. What they
        ask is not charity, but the opportunity to use their own labor in
        satisfying their own wants. Why can they not have that? It is their
        natural right. He who made food and clothing and shelter necessary to
        man's life has also given to man, in the power of labor, the means of
        maintaining that life; and when, without fault of their own, men
        cannot exert that power, there is somewhere a wrong of the same kind
        as denial of the right of property and denial of the right of life --
        a wrong equivalent to robbery and murder on the grandest scale.</small>        </p>
  <p><small>Charity can only palliate
        present suffering a little at the risk
        of fatal disease. For charity cannot right a wrong; only justice can
        do that.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Yet this is to be expected. For the question of the unemployed
        is
        but a more than usually acute phase of the great labor question -- a
        question of the distribution of wealth.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>What do we mean when we say that it is scarcity of employment
        from
        which the masses are suffering? Not what we mean when we say of the
        idle rich that they suffer from want of employment. There is no
        scarcity of the need for work when so many are suffering for the want
        of things that work produces, when all of us would like more, and all
        but a very few of us could advantageously use more, of those things.
        Nor do we mean that there is scarcity of ability to work or
        willingness to work. Nor yet do we mean that there is scarcity of the
        natural materials and forces necessary for work. 'They are as
        abundant as they ever were or ever will be until the energy radiated
        by the sun upon our globe loses its intensity. What we really mean by
"scarcity of employment " is such scarcity as would be brought about
        were an ice sheet continued into the summer to shut out the farmer
        from the fertile field he was anxious to cultivate; such a scarcity
        as was brought about in Lancashire when our blockade of the Southern
        ports raised suddenly and enormously the price of the staple that
        English operatives were anxious to turn into cloth.
        </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>What answers to the ice sheet or the blockade? Need we ask? May
        it
        not be seen, from our greatest cities to our newest territories, in
        the speculation which has everywhere been driving up the price of
        land -- that is to say, the toll that the active factor in all
        production must pay for permission to use the indispensable passive
        factor.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>If there are any who do not see the relation of these facts, it
        is
        because they have become accustomed to think of labor as deriving
        employment from capital, instead of, which is the true and natural
        relation, capital being the product and tool of labor. ... </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>So that, whether we begin at the right or the
        wrong end, any analysis brings us at last to the conclusion that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the
        opportunities of finding employment and the rate of all wages depend
        ultimately upon the freedom of access to land; the price that labor
        must pay for its use.</span>
        </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>"Scarcity of employment" is a comparatively new complaint in the
        United States. In our earlier times it was never heard of or thought
        of. There was "scarcity of employment " in Europe, but on this side
        of the Atlantic the trouble -- so it was deemed by a certain class --
        was "scarcity of labor." ... </small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Today, as the last census reports show, the majority of American
        farmers are rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the first form
        of tenancy; and the great majority of our people are landless men,
        without right to employ their own labor and without stake in the land
        they still foolishly speak of as their country. This is the reason why
        the army of the unemployed has appeared among us, why by pauperism has
        already become chronic, and why in the tramp we have in more dangerous
        type the proletarian of ancient Rome.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>These recurring spasms of business stagnation; these long-drawn
        periods of industrial depression, common to the civilized world, do not
        come from our treatment of money; are not caused and are not to be
        cured by changes of tariffs. Protection is a robbery of labor, and what
        is called free trade would give some temporary relief, but speculation
        in land would only set in the stronger, and at last labor and capital
        would again resist, by partial cessation, the blackmail demanded for
        their employment in production, and the same round would be run again.
        There is but one remedy, and that is what is now known as the
        single-tax -- the abolition of all taxes upon labor and capital, and of
        all taxes upon their processes and products, and the taking of economic
        rent, the unearned increment which now goes to the mere appropriator,
        for the payment of public expenses. Charity can merely demoralize and
        pauperize, while that indirect form of charity, the attempt to
        artificially "make work" by increasing public expenses and by charity
        woodyards and sewing-rooms, is still more dangerous. If, in this sense,
        work is to be made, it can be made more quickly by dynamite and
        kerosene.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>But there is no need for charity; no need for "making work." All
        that is needed is to remove the restrictions that prevent the natural
        demand for the products of work from availing itself of the natural
        supply. Remove them today, and every unemployed man in the country
        could find for himself employment tomorrow, and his "effective demand"
        for the things he desires would infuse new life into every subdivision
        of business and industry, even that of the dentist, the preacher, the
        magazine writer, or the actor.</small><br>
        <br>
        <small>The country is suffering from "scarcity of employment." But let
        anyone to-day attempt to employ his own labor or that of others,
        whether in making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, or in
        erecting a factory, and he will at once meet the speculator to demand
        of him an unnatural price for the land he must use, and the
        tax-gatherer to fine him for his act in employing labor as if he had
        committed a crime. The common-sense way to cure "scarcity of
        employment" is to take taxes off the products and processes of
        employment and to impose in their stead the tax that would end
        speculation in land.&nbsp; ...</small><small> <a

  <p><em>Q8. How about fertility value?</em><br>
    A. On the surface of the globe are countless varieties of <strong>exhaustible</strong> fertility,
      i.e. chemical constituency, differing in kind and degree, from the nitrogen,
      hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon of the soil to the carbon of the coal, the
      gold, and the diamond. Fertility as an attribute need not be predicated
      of agricultural land alone. Economic fertility belongs equally to any other
      land which yields to labor its product whether in food, mineral, or metal.
      Land may be fertile in wheat, corn, and potatoes. It may be fertile in
      cotton, in tobacco, or in rice. It may be fertile in diamonds, in gold,
      silver, copper, lead, or iron. It may be fertile in oil, coal, or natural
      gas, in a water power or water front. The value of artificial fertility
      is an improvement value. The value of natural fertility of any kind is
      a site value.</p>

              forces labor and capital (which is mobile,
              like labor) to resort to worse or &#8220;marginal&#8221; lands, thus
              scattering and spreading out settlement, raising aggregate demands on
        land, and wasting capital </span>(George, 1879). This lowering of the &#8220;margin of production&#8221; lowers
              the marginal productivity of labor and capital, and hence their economic
              rewards, tilting the
              distribution of income in favor of landowners, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">creating an illusion
              of overpopulation</span> (Malthus), and lack of investment outlets
              (Marx,
              Keynes, Hobson et al.).
          </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That pattern was first recognized
                  in farming, but it is universal.
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The underuse of central city lands
                  (large parts of which are
                  derelict) drives demand outwards to less accessible urban sites. From
                  there, the same force drives demand outwards to the inner suburbs;
        from there, to further suburbs, and so on. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;Urban sprawl&#8221;
        is the generic name, but &#8220;scatter&#8221; and
&#8220;disintegration&#8221; express the point better.</span> Farm and
                  wilderness defenders perceive the problem mainly at the edge of
                  cities, noting the loss of open land, but that is a lesser social and
                  economic loss than the destruction of urban values inside the edge.
          </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One way of denying the basic
problem is to call it
&#8220;unbalanced growth,&#8221; as in Orange County, where people
recognize it as too many jobs relative to the housing supply. It is
not the &#8220;unbalance&#8221; that is the problem, though: how can
there be too many jobs? It is too little housing that is the problem,
driving demand eastwards up through Sta. Ana Canyon, with its awful
traffic bottleneck, to central Riverside County, where it meets
demand fleeing north from San Diego.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now weave this pattern of
scattered settlement into the whole
system. It forces <span style="font-weight: bold;">auto-dependency and
truck-dependency</span>, multiplying
the need for fuels, pushing up their prices, and lowering the real
wages of those who have to consume them in larger quantities at
higher prices.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Much of what looks like
self-indulgent consumption of
U.S. motorists is not joy-riding, but the forced consumption of
commutation, forced by scattered urban sprawl, the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">product </span>of land
speculation. </span>Auto-apologists get this backwards, of course,
making
joy-riding the cause and sprawl the effect. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In forestry, the places to grow
commercial timber are lands that
are &#8220;flat, wet, and warm,&#8221; as John Baden summarizes it. (He
might have added, &#8220;accessible.&#8221;) Failure to restock such
lands economically pushes demand onto lands that are steep, dry and
cold, creating the &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">forestry sprawl</span>&#8221; from
which we suffer. </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Failure
to put indigenous waters of
southern California to full

actually enough water.</span> It drives demand northwards to the Owens
Valley and the Feather River, and eastward to the Colorado River, at
enormous social cost, much of it for energy. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Those who issue doomsday
dessication scenarios, and deplore the loss of water to farming, also
seem to have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no idea of how
a handful of giant landowners waste most
of our water on low-valued uses like pasture, hay, small grains and
rice, using primitive wasteful methods like flooding, or furrow
irrigation.</span></span> Only 2-3% of our irrigated lands use basic
conservation
techniques like drip emitters. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Those
who waste water in this way are
basically substituting water, a limited natural resource, for the
labor and capital others use to conserve water while growing
higher-valued crops</span> (Gaffney, 1997; Kahrl). </small></p>

      <p><small>Land that lacks utility and

          considered important, since it sustains and nourishes life. However,
          in the economic sense, air is not valuable because it hasn't been
          appropriated and there is enough for everyone. Thus there is no
          scarcity -- at least at the moment. This may not be true in the
          future, however, as knowledge of air pollution and its effect on

            3.0: Preface (pages ix.-xvi)</a></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I began pondering this dilemma about ten years ago after retiring
            from Working Assets, a business I cofounded in 1982. (Working Assets
            offers telephone and credit card services which automatically donate
            to nonprofit groups working for a better world.) My initial ruminations
            focused on climate change caused by human emissions of heat-trapping
            gases. Some analysts saw this as a &#8220;tragedy of the commons,&#8221; a
            concept popularized forty years ago by biologist Garrett Hardin.
            According to Hardin, people will always overuse a commons because
            it&#8217;s in their self-interest to do so. I saw the problem instead
            as a pair of tragedies: first a tragedy of the market, which has
            no way of curbing its own excesses, and second a tragedy of government,
            which fails to protect the atmosphere because polluting corporations
          are powerful and future generations don&#8217;t vote.</p>
          <p>This way of viewing the situation led to a hypothesis: if the commons
            is a victim of market and government failures, rather than the cause
            of its own destruction, the remedy might lie in strengthening the
            commons. But how might that be done? According to prevailing wisdom,
            commons are inherently difficult to manage because no one effectively
            owns them. If Waste Management Inc. owned the atmosphere, it would
            charge dumpers a fee, just as it does for terrestrial landfills.
            But since no one has title to the atmosphere, dumping proceeds without
            limit or cost.</p>
          <p>There&#8217;s a reason, of course, why no one has title to the atmosphere.
            For as long as anyone can remember there&#8217;s been more than enough
            air to go around, and thus no point in owning any of it. But nowadays,
            things are different. Our spacious skies aren&#8217;t empty anymore.
            We&#8217;ve filled them with invisible gases that are altering the
            climate patterns to which we and other species have adapted. In this
            new context, the atmosphere is a scarce resource, and having someone
            own it might not be a bad idea. ...<br>
            In retrospect, I realized the question I&#8217;d been asking since
            early adulthood was: Is capitalism a brilliant solution to the problem
            of scarcity, or is it itself modernity&#8217;s central problem? The
            question has many layers, but explorations of each layer led me to
            the same verdict. Although capitalism started as a brilliant solution,
            it has become the central problem of our day. It was right for its
            time, but times have changed.</p>
          <p>When capitalism started, nature was abundant and capital was scarce;
            it thus made sense to reward capital above all else. Today we&#8217;re
            awash in capital and literally running out of nature. We&#8217;re
            also losing many social arrangements that bind us together as communities
            and enrich our lives in nonmonetary ways. This doesn&#8217;t mean
            capitalism is doomed or useless, but it does mean we have to modify
            it. We have to adapt it to the twenty-first century rather than the
            eighteenth. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

        3.0 &#8212; Chapter 2: A Short History of Capitalism (pages 15-32)</a></p>        
        <blockquote>
          <p>Sometime around 1950, capitalism entered a new phase. Until then,
              poverty was a widely shared American experience. Wages were low,
              hours were long, and unemployment was a wolf at almost every door.
          In the 1930s, it reached 25 percent.</p>
          <p>This changed in the period following World War II. In 1958, economist
            John Kenneth Galbraith wrote a best-seller called The Affluent Society
            in which he noted that scarcity of goods was now a thing of the past
            for a majority of Americans. &#8220;The ordinary individual has access
            to amenities &#8212; foods, entertainment, personal transportation
            and plumbing &#8212; in which not even the rich rejoiced a century
            ago,&#8221; Galbraith observed. &#8220;So great has been the change
            that many of the desires of the individual are no longer even evident
            to him. They become so only as they are synthesized, elaborated,
            and nurtured by advertising and salesmanship, and these, in turn,
            have become among our most important and talented professions.&#8221;</p>
          <p>This was a major phase change for capitalism. Before, people wanted
            more goods than the economy could provide. Demand, in other words,
            exceeded supply, and we lived in what might be called shortage capitalism.
            We could also call it Capitalism 1.0.</p>
          <p>After the change, we shifted into surplus capitalism, or what I
            call Capitalism 2.0. In this version, there&#8217;s no limit to what
            corporations can produce; their problem is finding buyers. A sizeable
            chunk of GDP is spent to make people want this unneeded output. And
            credit is lavishly extended so they can buy it.</p>
          <p>This historic shift can be described another way. A century ago,
            our chief scarcity was goods. It thus made sense to sacrifice other
            things in pursuit of goods, and capitalism was masterful at doing
            this. Today we&#8217;re waist-deep in thneeds, and our scarcities
            are different. Among the middle classes, the top scarcities, I&#8217;d
            say, are time, companionship, and community (see figure 2.2). Among
            the poor, there remains a lack of goods, but that lack isn&#8217;t
            due to a shortage of production capacity &#8212; it&#8217;s due to
            the poor&#8217;s inability to pay. The critical scarcity here, in
            other words, is income. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

          Commons Rent</p>
          <p>It shouldn&#8217;t be thought that the commons is, or ought to be,
            a money-free zone. In fact, an important subject for economists (and
            the rest of us) to understand is commons rent.</p>
          <p>By this I don&#8217;t mean the monthly check you send to a landlord.
            In economics, rent has a more precise meaning: it&#8217;s money paid
            because of scarcity. If you&#8217;re not an economist, that may sound
            puzzling, but consider this. A city has available a million apartments.
            In absolute terms, that means apartments aren&#8217;t scarce. But
            the city is confined geographically and demand for apartments is
            intense. In this economic sense, apartments are scarce. Now think
            back to that check you pay your landlord, or the mortgage you pay
            the bank. Part of it represents the landlord&#8217;s operating costs
            or the bank&#8217;s cost of money, but part of it is pure rent &#8212; that
            is, money paid for scarcity. That&#8217;s why New Yorkers and San
            Franciscans write such large checks to landlords and banks, while
            people in Nebraska don&#8217;t.</p>
          <p>Rent rises when an increase in demand bumps into a limit in supply.
            Rent due to such bumping isn&#8217;t good or bad; it just is.We can
            (and should) debate the distribution of that rent, but the rent itself
            arises automatically. And it&#8217;s important that it does so, because
            this helps the larger economy allocate scarce resources efficiently.
            Other methods of allocation are possible. We can distribute scarce
            things on a first come, first served basis, or by lottery, political
            power, seniority, or race. Experience has shown, though, that selling
            scarce resources in open markets is usually the best approach, and
            such selling inevitably creates rent.</p>
          <p>Rent was of great interest to the early economists &#8212; Adam
            Smith, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill, among others &#8212; because
            it constituted most of the money earned by landowners, and land was
            then a major cost of production. The supply of land, these economists
            noted, is limited, but demand for it steadily increases. So, therefore,
            does its rent. Thus, landowners benefit from what Mill called the
            unearned increment &#8212; the rise in land value attributable not
            to any effort of the owner, but purely to a socially created increase
            in demand bumping into a limited supply of good land.</p>
          <p>The underappreciated American economist Henry George went further.
            Seeing both the riches and the miseries of the Gilded Age, he asked
            a logical question: Why does poverty persist despite economic growth?
            The answer, he believed, was the appropriation of rent by landowners.
            Even as the economy grew, the property rights system and the scarcity
            of land diverted almost all the gains to a landowning minority. Whereas
            competition limited the gains of working people, nothing kept down
            the landowners&#8217; gains. As Mill had noted, the value of their
            land just kept rising. To fix the problem, George advocated a steep
            tax on land and the abolition of other taxes. His bestselling book
            Progress and Poverty catapulted him to fame in the 1880s, but mainstream
            economists never took him seriously.</p>
          <p>By the twentieth century, economists had largely lost interest in
            rent; it seemed a trivial factor in wealth production compared to
            capital and labor. But the twenty-first century ecological crisis
            brings rent back to center-stage. Now it&#8217;s not just land that&#8217;s
            scarce, but clean water, undisturbed habitat, biological diversity,
            waste absorption capacity, and entire ecosystems.</p>
          <p>This brings us back to common property rights. The definition and
            allocation of property rights are the primary factors in determining
            who pays whom for what. If, in the case of pollution rights, pollution
            rights are given free to past polluters, the rent from the polluted
            ecosystem will also go to them. That&#8217;s because prices for pollution-laden
            products will rise as pollution is limited (remember, if demand is
            constant, a reduction in supply causes prices to go up), and those
            higher prices will flow to producers (which is to say, polluters).</p>
          <p>By contrast, if pollution rights are assigned to trusts representing
            pollutees and future generations, and if these trusts then sell these
            rights to polluters, the trusts rather than the polluters will capture
            the commons rent. If the trusts split this money between per capita
            dividends and expenditures on public goods, everyone benefits.</p>
          <p>At this moment, based on pollution rights allocated so far, polluting
            corporations are getting most of the commons rent. But the case for
            trusts getting the rent in the future is compelling. If this is done,
            consumers will pay commons rent not to corporations or government,
            but to themselves as beneficiaries of commons trusts. Each citizen&#8217;s
            dividend will be the same, but his payments will depend on his purchases
            of pollution-laden products. The more he pollutes, the more rent
            he&#8217;ll pay. High polluters will get back less than they put
            in, while low polluters will get back more. The microeconomic incentives,
            in other words, will be perfect. (See figure 6.1.)</p>
          <p>What&#8217;s equally significant, though less obvious, is that the
            macroeconomic incentives will be perfect too. That is, it will be
            in everyone&#8217;s interest to reduce the total level of pollution.
            Remember how rent for scarce things works: the lower the supply,
            the higher the rent. Now, imagine you&#8217;re a trustee of an ecosystem,
            and leaving aside (for the sake of argument) your responsibility
            to preserve the asset for future generations, you want to increase
            dividends. Do you raise the number of pollution permits you sell,
            or lower it? The correct, if counterintuitive answer is: you lower
          the number of permits. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

      <li><small>We see people or corporations like Andrew, monopolizing resources
          such as land -&#8211; an urban land speculator who holds an acre out
          of use, anticipating a price rise, is displacing the rest of us, forcing
          development out into the countryside. A single acre of downtown land
          brought into use would save a dozen outside acres from premature sprawl
          development.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those who take, monopolize, and pollute,
        are imposing costs on the rest of us and on the economy in general. We
        are forced to be less efficient, or forced to endure hardships, so that
        the takers, monopolizers and polluters can benefit. That is not fair.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Is there a solution? Of course there is. It's a simple solution. To
  respect our common interest in our planet's resources, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">those who <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">take </span>or <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">monopolize </span>or <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">pollute </span>more than their fair share
  of our planet should compensate those of us who they are taking from. </span>... <a href="../docs/Beck_BP.html"><span
