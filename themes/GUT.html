<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
    X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
      is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
      of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
      and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
      the greatest certitude and highest sanction. ...</p>
  <p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men, and
      all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
      In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely
    offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice &#8212; for,
    so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems
    to be
      the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and
    asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform
    ourselves
      to the law &#8212; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the distribution
          of wealth and power; </li>
    <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
    <li>tame the ruthless passions of greed; </li>
    <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
    <li>light in dark places the lamp of knowledge; </li>
    <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse to discovery; </li>
    <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
    <li>make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
      or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will
    make all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter
    and spirit
      of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
      that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men
      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
      inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
  <p>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
      by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political rights
      will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of
      nature. Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes,
      as population
      increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment
      at starvation wages. ...</p>
  <p>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one man
      to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have made them
      his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on. This
      is the subtile alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
      the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
      is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has
      been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom,
      and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">read

<p>      Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SS.html">Sharing
      Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent &#8212; ground rent and
resource rent &#8212; although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
&#8212; tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency &#8212; the compact city &#8212; not waste &#8212; the mall
and
automobile.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the
public, governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments &#8212; left, right, or undecided &#8212; hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies. Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Noticing rent, realizing its
social nature, accepting that it's to
be shared, and understanding that wages and interest should not be
expropriated, for most people that's a new way of thinking. Thinking
such thoughts leads to a new way of conceiving economics, too.
Ecological economics becomes not just a branch of economics but a
whole new discipline, needing a new name. In geonomics we maintain
the distinction between items bearing exchange value that come into
being by human effort &#8212; wealth &#8212; and those that don't &#8212; land.
Keeping
this distinction in the forefront makes it obvious and
non-controversial that speculating in land drives sprawl, that
hoarding land retards Third World development, that borrowing to buy
land plus buildings engorges banks, that so-called "interest" is
quasi-rent, that the cost of land inflates faster than the price of
produced goods and services, that over half of corporate profit, says
the Urban Land Institute, is from real estate. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Summing up these analyses, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geonomists offer a Grand Unifying
Theory, that the flow of rent pulls all other indicators in its wake.
</span>Geonomics differs from economics as chemistry from alchemy, as
astronomy from astrology. The acid test of any science is prediction,
a test that economics fails and geonomics passes. Plugging in the
land price cycle of 17+ years lets geonomists crank out predictions
more accurate than those generated by "the experts" who missed, for
example, the collapse of mighty Japan. When the land of the Rising
Sun was on the market for four times the assessed value of all
America, that's when a few geonomists, like voices in the wilderness,
countered conventional wisdom by proclaiming that the Japanese boom
would bust. According to these geonomic prognosticators, don't expect
America's next downturn for at least another five years, despite the
tech wreck or any other stock market fluctuations. </small><small>...&nbsp;
