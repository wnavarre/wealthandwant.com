Nic Tideman:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_CTL.html">The Case
for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
<small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
<small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What is Land?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>David Ricardo defined land, memorably, as &#8216;the original and
indestructible powers of the soil.&#8217;&nbsp; This definition is overly
narrow.&nbsp; It would exclude from land such valuable and
destructible things as minerals and topsoil. Ricardo&#8217;s definition
even suggests that the value of land arising from urban locations might
not be included in &#8216;land,&#8217; since it would not necessarily qualify as a
&#8216;power of the soil.&#8217;</small><br>
<br>
<small>The definition of land that is most useful in economic theory is
that
land is all scarce factors of production other than people and the
products of human effort. Land is the gifts of nature.&nbsp; Thus land
includes both rural and urban territory, mineral resources, water, fish
in oceans and rivers, virgin forests, geosynchronous orbits and the
frequency spectrum.</small><br>
<br>
<small><strong>While there is some tendency to think of measuring land in &#8216;stock&#8217;
terms (&#8216;What is the value of that piece of land?&#8217;), the flow of
services from land is more fundamental.&nbsp;</strong> While capital goods have
selling prices related to their costs of production, such a calculation
does not apply to land since, by definition, land is not
produced.&nbsp; The selling price of land is conceived in economic
theory as the present value of the net return after taxes to the future
flow of land services, when the land is used in the way that maximizes
that present value.&nbsp; Following David Ricardo, the value of the
flow of services from land is sometimes described as the residual after
paying other factors their opportunity costs, when land is used
efficiently.&nbsp; But in equilibrium, a similar statement can be made
about any other factor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>With some components of land, such as river water flowing into
an
ocean, the extent to which the land is used in one period has no
influence on the extent to which it can be used in other periods.&nbsp;
In other cases, such as mineral deposits, use in one period comes at
the expense of use in other periods.&nbsp; Agricultural land has a
capacity to be &#8216;mined&#8217; of the nutrients that make it productive,
making it somewhat similar to mineral deposits.</small><br>
<br>
<small><strong>With urban land there is a different type of interdependency
between
use at one time and the potential flow of services at another.</strong>&nbsp; To
be used most productively, urban land must be combined with durable,
immobile capital.&nbsp; Therefore an increase in the intensity of urban
land use often requires the destruction of previous capital
investments.&nbsp; This intertemporal dependence means that, in
principle, a forecast of all future economic conditions is needed to
know what use of land is best today.&nbsp; Since people make different
forecasts, they reach different conclusions about what use of land is
best today.&nbsp; Only with the passage of time, if at all, is it
possible to know what use of land would have been best.</small><br>
<br>
<small><strong>The fact that structures are durable and immobile also means
that care
must be taken in defining the value of the flow of land services.&nbsp;</strong>
There is a tendency to think of &#8220;the rent of land&#8221; as the amount of
money that land yields to those who have exclusive use of it.&nbsp;
However, this formulation is not always useful for defining the
rent of land over a particular interval of time.&nbsp; If an investor
spends a year and &pound;20 million erecting a building that is
expected to last for 30 years, what was the rent of the land under the
building during the year of construction?&nbsp; It is not sensible to
say that, if the best possible use of the land produces a negative cash
flow over a given interval of time, then land has no rental value over
that interval.&nbsp; If markets were perfect and the decision to
construct the structure was optimal, the finished building would have a
value that was greater than its cost of construction by the rent of the
land it occupied and the accumulated interest on construction costs and
land rent.&nbsp; But if a non-optimal construction decision is made,
that does not reduce the rent of land.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>To give a meaning to &#8216;the rent of land&#8217; that does not depend on
when
construction hap&shy;pens to occur, it is useful to define &#8216;the rent of
land&#8217; as the opportunity cost of leaving vacant land vacant.&nbsp; Thus
in the case of the year of construction discussed above, one would ask,
&#8216;Suppose that the construction had been postponed for a year.&nbsp;
Perhaps by that time it would be appropriate to invest in a &pound;21
million building rather than a &pound;20 million building.&nbsp; If one
developed the most profitable possible plan for the land, subject to
the constraint that the land be left vacant for the first year, how
much lower would the present value of net returns be?&#8217;&nbsp; The answer
to this question, the loss of the present value of net returns from
postponing use of land for a year, would be the rent of the land for
the year.&nbsp; This is the amount of money that one would need to get
in net returns from some pre-existing use to justify postponing
redevelopment for a year.&nbsp; Thus the rent of land for any developed
site, for any year, is defined to be the answer to the question, &#8216;If
this site were undevel&shy;oped, what would be the cost of leaving
undeveloped and unused for a year?&#8217;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Land also differs from labor and capital in the origin of claims
to own
it.&nbsp; </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Labor can be defined as the factors of production that own
themselves.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>Ownership of capital is derived originally from
organizing its production and paying the various factors that are
employed to produce it.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>Ownership of land, by contrast, derives
from rights of exclusive use and access that are granted by governments.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Ownership of land is thus a form
of privilege.&nbsp; The word
&#8216;privilege&#8217; comes from the Latin prive + legis, meaning &#8216;private
law&#8217;.&nbsp; A private law is a law that has someone&#8217;s name it, that is,
a law that authorizes one person to do what others are not permitted to
do.&nbsp; In a just world, there would be no privilege.&nbsp; (Thus no
one is underprivileged.)&nbsp; In a just world, land would not be
&#8216;owned&#8217;, but rather &#8216;held&#8217; or &#8216;possessed&#8217;, subject to a payment that
reflected the value given up by others in allowing one person to have
exclusive use of a site. ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>II. What is
waste, and what should we do about it?</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We are all against wasting
resources: wonderful - but what is
waste? In answering, I will deal with two cognate questions.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We agree, we should combat waste with a family of green
taxes,
but what green taxes? When, and where, and why?</small></li>
  <li><small>We agree on containing sprawl, but should we stress
repelling
people from designated green areas, or attracting them to designated
human habitats?</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A. What is waste?</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The question has been faced
before. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gifford
Pinchot</span> was a leader
with a magic name in the U.S.A. during the early conservation era. He
answered well for his times and, I submit, for ours too.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>"... natural resources must be developed and
preserved
for the benefit of the many and not merely for the profit of a few. ...
the people shall get their fair share of the benefit which comes from
the development of the country which belongs to us all."</small></blockquote>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He did not say just "preserved;"
he said "developed and
preserved." Today I suspect he would say "REdevelop," to get away
from the negative baggage carried by "develop;" I certainly will.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Pinchot went on:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>"The first principle of conservation is
development, the
use of the natural resources now existing ... for the benefit of the
people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting
the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in
their destruction by waste. ... Conservation, then, stands emphatically
for the use of substitutes (he mentions water for power and
transportation) for all the exhaustible natural resources, ... The
development of our natural resources and the fullest use of them for
the present generation is the first duty of this generation. ... </small>
    <p><small>In the second place conservation stands for the
prevention of
waste. ... "</small></p>
    <small> </small></blockquote>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So Pinchot was against waste, like
everyone, but he gives it a new
turn (or, rather, an old turn that many have forgotten). <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To him,
WASTE MEANS FAILING TO USE RENEWABLE RESOURCES</span>. Urban land makes
a
good example. Urban land, economically speaking, is a lot like
falling water, strange as it seems. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Economists
(who are not all bad)
classify urban land as a "flow resource."</span> They liken it to
flowing
water because its services perish with time, whether used or not -
and we are trapped in the one-way flow of time. It is an even better
example of a "flow resource" than water itself, because unused water
may have other uses downstream. Even in wasting out through
California's Golden Gate, fresh water repels salinity. The unreaped
harvests of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the
Golden Gate of time like lost loves, and magic moments that passed us
by. The waste of NOT using flow resources is just as real as the
waste of misusing exhaustible resources. Indeed, when we tote up the
transportation costs of disintegrated urban settlement patterns, it
is clear that failure to use good urban land is a major cause of
wasting energy.&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Gaffney_RLT&GLT.html"> <span

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><small><small><b>Pinchot
on "Development"</b></small></small></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Gifford Pinchot, the father of
Conservation, was not against
developing land. In his own words:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The first principle of
conservation is development, the
use of the natural resources now existing ... for the benefit of the
people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting
the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in
their destruction by waste. ... Conservation, then, stands emphatically
for the use of substitutes for all the exhaustible natural resources,
... (water power and water transportation are his examples). ... The
development of our natural resources and the fullest use of them for
the present generation is the first duty of this generation. ... </small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the second place conservation
stands for the prevention of
waste. ... "</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So Pinchot was against waste, so
what? Who isn't? This could be
just a banality, but he gives it a new turn. To him, waste means
failing to use renewable resources. His example was hydropower, which
he would substitute for coal and oil. That is not such a good example
today, when we cherish our few remaining wild rivers, but today urban
land makes an even better example.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>"Urban land?", you may ask. "What
has urban land in common with
falling water?" Economists (who are not all bad) classify urban land
as a "flow resource." </strong>They liken it to flowing water because its
services perish with time, whether used or not, and we are trapped in
the one-way flow of time. Likewise, urban land is not depleted by
use. It is an even better example of a "flow resource" than flowing
water itself, because, as we are so conscious today, "unharnessed"
flowing water may have other downstream uses. Even in wasting out
through the Golden Gate, it may repel salinity. The unreaped harvests
of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the gates of time
like lost loves dimming, and golden moments we let slip away beyond
recall.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is this "service" of urban
land, that we should be mindful of
it? 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>For one thing, using central urban land conserves all the
hydrocarbons and other resources otherwise needed to traverse it.
Compact urban settlement is a direct substitute for oil, with all
that implies - and it implies a great deal, which I will leave you to
fill in.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, using good central land saves all the costs of
settling
on
other land - including the cost of taking more of the shrinking
habitat from endangered species. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore,
habitat-savers should
emulate Pinchot and favor development in the right places, the better
to oppose it in the wrong places. This is the great lost secret of
conservation our times have forgot. </span>You cannot beat development
by
opposing it everywhere it pops up. People need land for all kinds of
legitimate things, and they will have it. To stop urban sprawl, you
must support compact, efficient urban development, including healthy,
timely renewal of older cities, inner suburbs, and neighborhoods.
