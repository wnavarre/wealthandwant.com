of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I cannot go over all the points
I would like to try, but I wish
to call your attention to the utter absurdity of private property in
land! Why, consider it, the idea of a man's selling the
earth &#8212; the earth, our common mother. A man selling that which no
man produced &#8212; a man passing title from one generation to another.
Why, it is the most absurd thing in the world. Why, did you ever
think of it? What right has a dead man to land? For whom was this
earth created? It was created for the living, certainly, not for the
dead. Well, now we treat it as though it was created for the dead.
Where do our land titles come from? They come from men who for the
most part are past and gone. Here in this new country you get a
little nearer the original source; but go to the Eastern States and
go back over the Atlantic. There you may clearly see the power that
comes from landownership. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The utter absurdity of this thing
of private property in land! I
defy any one to show me any good from it, look where you please. Go
out in the new lands, where my attention was first called to it, or
go to the heart of the capital of the world &#8212; London.
Everywhere, when your eyes are once opened, you will see its
inequality and you will see its absurdity. You do not have to go
farther than Burlington [Iowa]. You have here a most beautiful site for
a
city, but the city itself as compared with what it might be is a
miserable, straggling town. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A
gentleman showed me today a big hole
alongside one of your streets. The place has been filled up all
around it and this hole is left. It is neither pretty nor useful. Why
does that hole stay there? Well, it stays there because somebody
claims it as his private property. </span>There is a man, this
gentleman
told me, who wished to grade another lot and wanted somewhere to put
the dirt he took off it, and he offered to buy this hole so that he
might fill it up. Now it would have been a good thing for Burlington
to have it filled up, a good thing for you all &#8212; your town would
look better, and you yourself would be in no danger of tumbling into
it some dark night. Why, my friend pointed out to me another similar
hole in which water had collected and told me that two children had
been drowned there. And he likewise told me that a drunken man some
years ago had fallen into such a hole and had brought suit against
the city which cost you taxpayers some $11,000. Clearly it is to the
interest of you all to have that particular hole I am talking of
filled up. The man who wanted to fill it up offered the hole owner
$300. But the hole owner refused the offer and declared that he would
hold out until he could get $1000; and in the meanwhile that
unsightly and dangerous hole must remain. This is but an illustration
of private property in land.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You may see the same thing all
over this country. See how
injuriously in the agricultural districts this thing of private
property in land affects the roads and the distances between the
people. <b>A man does not take what land he wants, what he can use,
but he takes all he can get, and the consequence is that his next
neighbour has to go further along, people are separated from each
other further than they ought to be, to the increased difficulty of
production, to the loss of neighbourhood and companionship. They have
more roads to maintain than they can decently maintain; they must do
more work to get the same result, and life is in every way harder and
drearier. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> When you come to the cities it is
just the other way. In the
country the people are too much scattered; in the great cities they
are too crowded. Go to a city like New York and there they are jammed
together like sardines in a box, living family upon family, one above
the other. It is an unnatural and unwholesome life. How can you have
anything like a home in a tenement room, or two or three rooms? How
can children be brought up healthily with no place to play? Two or
three weeks ago I read of a New York judge who fined two little boys
five dollars for playing hop-scotch on the street&#8212;where else
could they play? Private property in land had robbed them of all
place to play. Even a temperance man, who had investigated the
subject, said that in his opinion the gin palaces of London were a
positive good in this, that they enabled the people whose abodes were
dark and squalid rooms to see a little brightness and thus prevent
them from going wholly mad.&nbsp; ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>How Best to Use the Common
Estate.</b>
</small><br>
<small>The great problem, then, that the nations, or, what comes to the
same thing, that the Governments of nations have to solve is &#8212; what
is the most profitable and remunerative investment they can make of
this common property in the interest and for the benefit of the
people to whom it belongs? In other words, how can they bring the
largest, and, as far as possible, the most skilled amount of
effective labour to bear on the proper cultivation and improvement of
the land? &#8212; how can they make it yield the largest amount of human
food, human comforts and human enjoyments &#8212; and how can its
aggregate produce be divided so as to give everyone the fairest and
largest share he is entitled to without passing over or excluding
anyone?
</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Security of Possession Necessary to Secure the Rights of the
Improver</b>.
</small><br>
<small>It is because the principle of Private Property fulfils all
these
conditions, satisfies all these requirements and secures all these
results, that it has been regarded by all nations as a necessary
social institution under all forms of government.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The most active, energetic, and,
at the same time, the most
powerful principle of human action that we know of, is self-interest,
and self-interest is the principle of Private Property. This
principle of self-interest is deeply embedded and engrained in our
nature; its activity is constant, uniform and irrepressible, and
whether we advert to it or not, it is the secret and inexhaustible
spring of nearly all our actions, efforts and endeavours. We labour
with untiring energy, earnestness and perseverance, when we know that
we are working for ourselves, for our own interests and benefits.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If, therefore, the land of a
country was surrendered up to the
self-interests of the people of that country; if it was given up to
the operations of the most powerful moral force known to man, which
is everywhere present and everywhere supremely active and energetic,
and which would throw its whole force and strength into the effort
needed for the proper cultivation and improvement of the soil, then
we might expect the largest possible returns of human food and human
enjoyments that the land could possibly yield.</small></p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wherever,
therefore, the principle of Private Property in Land is
carried out to the full extent that its justice and the interests of
the community demand, the land of that country will be parcelled out
in larger or smaller lots among its people, on the plain principle of
justice, that the increased fertility and productiveness which they
shall have imparted to the soil shall be their own, and that they
shall have a strict right of property in the returns &#8212; no matter how
abundant &#8212; it shall yield to their capital and labour.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With this disposition adopted the
powerful principle of
self-interest will be brought to bear effectively and with all its
energy and force on the cultivation and improvement of the soil; and
as the cultivators or farmers will have a strict right of property in
the products which it shall yield to their labour and capital, so it
will be their highest interests, and they will make their best
efforts to make them as large and as abundant as possible. The
returns, therefore, from the land will be the highest it is capable
of yielding. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To stimulate
the production and enlarged growth of that
invaluable property which is created in the development and
improvement of the soil, and to secure to its owner the certainty of
enjoying all its uses and benefits, he must have a right to the
continued and undisturbed possession of his land.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The labour and capital necessary
for the production of property of
this kind are immediate; the returns to be derived from it may be
spread over many years, perhaps over all future time. No man will
incur the expenditure if others, not himself, are to be benefited by
it. He might, no doubt, enjoy the full benefit of improvements
already made after a certain term of years; but to stimulate him to
make further and larger improvements in the soil, and, at the same
time, to secure him a certainty of enjoying the full fruits of those
he has already made, no term of years can produce on men's minds what
has been most felicitously called "the magical effect of perpetuity
of tenure."</small></p>

<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When, therefore, a

private property in the land of a country, that claim is simply
unintelligible, except in the broad principle that the land of a
country is not a free gift at all, but solely a family inheritance;</span>
that it is not a free gift which God has bestowed on His creatures,
but an inheritance which he has left to His children; that they,
therefore, being God's eldest sons, inherit this property by right of
succession; that the rest of the world have no share or claim to it,
on the ground that origin is tainted with the stain of illegitimacy.
The world, however, will hardly submit to this shameful imputation of
its own degradation, especially when it is not sustained by even a
shadow of reason.
</small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>I infer,
therefore, that no individual or class of individuals can
hold a right of private property in the land of a country; that the
people of that country, in their public corporate capacity, are, and
always must be, the real owners of the land of their country --
holding an indisputable title to it, in the fact that they received
it as a free gift from its Creator, and as a necessary means for
preserving and enjoying the life He has bestowed upon them.</small></p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your Holiness will see from the explanation I have given that the reform
    we propose, like all true reforms, has both an ethical and an economic side.
    By ignoring the ethical side, and pushing our proposal merely as a reform
    of taxation, we could avoid the objections that arise from confounding ownership
    with possession and attributing to private property in land that security
    of use and improvement that can be had even better without it. All that we
    seek practically is the legal abolition, as fast as possible, of taxes on
    the products and processes of labor, and the consequent concentration of
    taxation on land values irrespective of improvements. To put our proposals
    in this way would be to urge them merely as a matter of wise public expediency.</p>
  <p>There are indeed many single-tax men who do put our proposals in this way;
    who seeing the beauty of our plan from a fiscal standpoint do not concern
    themselves further. But to those who think as I do, the ethical is the more
    important side. Not only do we not wish to evade the question of private
    property in land, but to us it seems that the beneficent and far-reaching
    revolution we aim at is too great a thing to be accomplished by &#8220;intelligent
    self-interest,&#8221; and can be carried by nothing less than the religious
    conscience. ...</p>
  <p>To your proposition that &#8220;Our first and most fundamental principle
    when we undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses must be the inviolability
    of private property&#8221; we would joyfully agree if we could only understand
    you to have in mind the moral element, and to mean rightful private property,
    as when you speak of marriage as ordained by God&#8217;s authority we may
    understand an implied exclusion of improper marriages. Unfortunately, however,
    other expressions show that you mean private property in general and have
    expressly in mind private property in land. This confusion of thought, this
    non-distribution of terms, runs through your whole argument, leading you
    to conclusions so unwarranted by your premises as to be utterly repugnant
    to them, as when from the moral sanction of private property in the things
    produced by labor you infer something entirely different and utterly opposed,
    a similar right of property in the land created by God.</p>
  <p>Private property is not of one species, and moral sanction can no more be
    asserted universally of it than of marriage. That proper marriage conforms
    to the law of God does not justify the polygamic or polyandric or incestuous
    marriages that are in some countries permitted by the civil law. And as there
    may be immoral marriage so may there be immoral private property. Private
    property is that which may be held in ownership by an individual, or that
    which may be held in ownership by an individual with the sanction of the
    state. The mere lawyer, the mere servant of the state, may rest here, refusing
    to distinguish between what the state holds equally lawful. Your Holiness,
    however, is not a servant of the state, but a servant of God, a guardian
    of morals. You know, as said by St. Thomas of Aquin, that &#8212;</p>
  <p>Human law is law only in virtue of its accordance with right reason and
    it is thus manifest that it flows from the eternal law. And in so far as
    it deviates from right reason it is called an unjust law. In such case it
    is not law at all, but rather a species of violence.</p>
  <p>Thus, that any species of property is permitted by the state does not of
    itself give it moral sanction. The state has often made things property that
    are not justly property, but involve violence and robbery. For instance,
    the things of religion, the dignity and authority of offices of the church,
    the power of administering her sacraments and controlling her temporalities,
    have often by profligate princes been given as salable property to courtiers
    and concubines. At this very day in England an atheist or a heathen may buy
    in open market, and hold as legal property, to be sold, given or bequeathed
    as he pleases, the power of appointing to the cure of souls, and the value
    of these legal rights of presentation is said to be no less than &pound;17,000,000.</p>
  <p>Or again: Slaves were universally treated as property by the customs and
    laws of the classical nations, and were so acknowledged in Europe long after
    the acceptance of Christianity. At the beginning of this century there was
    no Christian nation that did not, in her colonies at least, recognize property
    in slaves, and slaveships crossed the seas under Christian flags. In the
    United States, little more than thirty years ago, to buy a man gave the same
    legal ownership as to buy a horse, and in Mohammedan countries law and custom
    yet make the slave the property of his captor or purchaser.</p>
  <p>Yet your Holiness, one of the glories of whose pontificate is the attempt
    to break up slavery in its last strongholds, will not contend that the moral
    sanction that attaches to property in things produced by labor can, or ever
    could, apply to property in slaves.</p>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.)</p>
  <p><strong><em>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property.</em></strong> (5.)</p>
  <p>Clearly, purchase and sale cannot give, but can only transfer ownership.
    Property that in itself has no moral sanction does not obtain moral sanction
    by passing from seller to buyer.</p>
  <p><strong>If right reason does not make the slave the property of the slave-hunter
    it does not make him the property of the slave-buyer. </strong>Yet your reasoning
    as to private property in land would as well justify property in slaves.
    <em><strong>To show this it is only needful to change in your argument the word
    land to the word slave</strong></em>. It would then read:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor,
        the very reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and to hold
        it as his own private possession.</p>
    <p>If one man hires out to another his strength or his industry, he does this
        for the purpose of receiving in return what is necessary for food and living;
        he thereby expressly proposes to acquire a full and legal right, not only
        to the remuneration, but also to the disposal of that remuneration as he
        pleases.</p>
    <p>Thus, if he lives sparingly, saves money, and invests his savings, for
      greater security, in a slave, the slave in such a case is only his wages
      in another
        form; and consequently, a working-man&#8217;s slave thus purchased should
        be as completely at his own disposal as the wages he receives for his
        labor.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Nor in turning your argument for private property in land into an
      argument for private property in men am I doing a new thing. In my own
      country, in
    my own time, this very argument, that purchase gave ownership, was the common
    defense of slavery.</strong> It was made by statesmen, by jurists, by clergymen, by
    bishops; it was accepted over the whole country by the great mass of the
    people. By it was justified the separation of wives from husbands, of children
    from parents, the compelling of labor, the appropriation of its fruits, the
    buying and selling of Christians by Christians. In language almost identical
    with yours it was asked, <em>&#8220;Here is a poor man who has worked hard, lived
    sparingly, and invested his savings in a few slaves. Would you rob him of
    his earnings by liberating those slaves?&#8221; </em>Or it was said: &#8220;<em>Here
    is a poor widow; all her husband has been able to leave her is a few negroes,
    the earnings of his hard toil. Would you rob the widow and the orphan by
    freeing these negroes?&#8221; </em>And because of this perversion of reason, this
    confounding of unjust property rights with just property rights, this acceptance
    of man&#8217;s law as though it were God&#8217;s law, there came on our nation
    a judgment of fire and blood.</p>
  <p><strong>The error of our people in thinking that what in itself was not
      rightfully property could become rightful property by purchase and sale
      is the same
    error into which your Holiness falls.</strong> It is not merely formally the same;
    it is essentially the same. <em><strong>Private property in land, no less than
    private property in slaves, is a violation of the true rights of property. </strong></em>They are
    different forms of the same robbery; twin devices by which the perverted
    ingenuity of man has sought to enable the strong and the cunning to escape
    God&#8217;s requirement of labor by forcing it on others.</p>
  <p>What difference does it make whether I merely own the land on which another
    man must live or own the man himself? Am I not in the one case as much his
    master as in the other? Can I not compel him to work for me? Can I not take
    to myself as much of the fruits of his labor; as fully dictate his actions?
    Have I not over him the power of life and death?</p>
  <p>For to deprive a man of land is as certainly to kill him as to deprive him
    of blood by opening his veins, or of air by tightening a halter around his
    neck.</p>
  <p><strong>The essence of slavery is in empowering one man to obtain the labor
      of another without recompense. Private property in land does this as fully
      as chattel
    slavery.</strong> The slave-owner must leave to the slave enough of his earnings to
    enable him to live. Are there not in so-called free countries great bodies
    of working-men who get no more? How much more of the fruits of their toil
    do the agricultural laborers of Italy and England get than did the slaves
    of our Southern States? Did not private property in land permit the landowner
    of Europe in ruder times to demand the<a href="http://www.fibri.de/jus/arthbes.htm"> <em>jus primae noctis</em></a>? Does not the same
    last outrage exist today in diffused form in the immorality born of monstrous
    wealth on the one hand and ghastly poverty on the other?</p>
  <p>In what did the slavery of Russia consist but in giving to the master land
    on which the serf was forced to live? <strong>When an Ivan or a Catherine
    enriched their favorites with the labor of others they did not give men,
    they gave
    land. </strong>And when the appropriation of land has gone so far that no free land
    remains to which the landless man may turn, then without further violence
    <strong>the more insidious form of labor robbery involved in private property
    in land takes the place of chattel slavery, because more economical and convenient.</strong>    For under it the slave does not have to be caught or held, or to be fed when
    not needed. He comes of himself, begging the privilege of serving, and when
    no longer wanted can be discharged. The lash is unnecessary; hunger is as
    efficacious. This is why the Norman conquerors of England and the English
    conquerors of Ireland did not divide up the people, but divided the land.
    This is why European slave-ships took their cargoes to the New World, not
    to Europe.</p>
  <p>Slavery is not yet abolished. Though in all Christian countries its ruder
    form has now gone, it still exists in the heart of our civilization in more
    insidious form, and is increasing. There is work to be done for the glory
    of God and the liberty of man by other soldiers of the cross than those warrior
    monks whom, with the blessing of your Holiness, Cardinal Lavigerie is sending
    into the Sahara. Yet, your Encyclical employs in defense of one form of slavery
    the same fallacies that the apologists for chattel slavery used in defense
    of the other!</p>
  <p>The Arabs are not wanting in acumen. Your Encyclical reaches far. What shall
    your warrior monks say, if when at the muzzle of their rifles they demand
    of some Arab slave-merchant his miserable caravan, he shall declare that
    he bought them with his savings, and producing a copy of your Encyclical,
    shall prove by your reasoning that his slaves are consequently &#8220;only
    his wages in another form,&#8221; and ask if they who bear your blessing
    and own your authority propose to &#8220;deprive him of the liberty of disposing
    of his wages and thus of all hope and possibility of increasing his stock
    and bettering his condition in life&#8221;?</p>
  <p><strong><em>3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land.</em></strong> (8.)</p>
  <p>Your own statement that land is the inexhaustible storehouse that God owes
    to man must have aroused in your Holiness&#8217;s mind an uneasy questioning
    of its appropriation as private property, for, as though to reassure yourself,
    you proceed to argue that its ownership by some will not injure others. You
    say in substance, that even though divided among private owners the earth
    does not cease to minister to the needs of all, since those who do not possess
    the soil can by selling their labor obtain in payment the produce of the
    land.</p>
  <p>Suppose that to your Holiness as a judge of morals one should put this case
    of conscience:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>I am one of several children to whom our father left a field abundant for
        our support. As he assigned no part of it to any one of us in particular,
        leaving the limits of our separate possession to be fixed by ourselves, I
        being the eldest took the whole field in exclusive ownership. But in doing
        so I have not deprived my brothers of their support from it, for I have let
        them work for me on it, paying them from the produce as much wages as I would
        have had to pay strangers. Is there any reason why my conscience should not
        be clear?</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What would be your answer? Would you not tell him that he was in mortal
    sin, and that his excuse added to his guilt? Would you not call on him to
    make restitution and to do penance?</p>
  <p>Or, suppose that as a temporal prince your Holiness were ruler of a rainless
    land, such as Egypt, where there were no springs or brooks, their want being
    supplied by a bountiful river like the Nile. Supposing that having sent a
    number of your subjects to make fruitful this land, bidding them do justly
    and prosper, you were told that some of them had set up a claim of ownership
    in the river, refusing the others a drop of water, except as they bought
    it of them; and that thus they had become rich without work, while the others,
    though working hard, were so impoverished by paying for water as to be hardly
    able to exist?</p>
  <p>Would not your indignation wax hot when this was told?</p>
  <p>Suppose that then the river-owners should send to you and thus excuse their
    action:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The river, though divided among private owners, ceases not thereby
        to minister to the needs of all, for there is no one who drinks who does
        not
      drink of
        the water of the river. Those who do not possess the water of the river
      contribute their labor to get it; so that it may be truly said that all
      water is supplied
        either from one&#8217;s own river, or from some laborious industry which
        is paid for either in the water, or in that which is exchanged for the
        water.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Would the indignation of your Holiness be abated? Would it not wax fiercer
    yet for the insult to your intelligence of this excuse?</p>
  <p>I do not need more formally to show your Holiness that between utterly depriving
    a man of God&#8217;s gifts and depriving him of God&#8217;s gifts unless
    he will buy them, is merely the difference between the robber who leaves
    his victim to die and the robber who puts him to ransom. But I would like
    to point out how your statement that &#8220;the earth, though divided among
    private owners, ceases not thereby to minister to the needs of all&#8221; overlooks
    the largest facts.</p>
  <p>From your palace of the Vatican the eye may rest on the expanse of the Campagna,
    where the pious toil of religious congregations and the efforts of the state
    are only now beginning to make it possible for men to live. Once that expanse
    was tilled by thriving husbandmen and dotted with smiling hamlets. What for
    centuries has condemned it to desertion? History tells us. It was private
    property in land; the growth of the great estates of which Pliny saw that
    ancient Italy was perishing; the cause that, by bringing failure to the crop
    of men, let in the Goths and Vandals, gave Roman Britain to the worship of
    Odin and Thor, and in what were once the rich and populous provinces of the
    East shivered the thinned ranks and palsied arms of the legions on the simitars
    of Mohammedan hordes, and in the sepulcher of our Lord and in the Church
    of St. Sophia trampled the cross to rear the crescent!</p>
  <p>If you will go to Scotland, you may see great tracts that under the Gaelic
    tenure, which recognized the right of each to a foothold in the soil, bred
    sturdy men, but that now, under the recognition of private property in land,
    are given up to wild animals. If you go to Ireland, your Bishops will show
    you, on lands where now only beasts graze, the traces of hamlets that, when
    they were young priests, were filled with honest, kindly, religious people.*</p>

  <p>If you will come to the United States, you will find in a land wide enough
    and rich enough to support in comfort the whole population of Europe, the
    growth of a sentiment that looks with evil eye on immigration, because the
    artificial scarcity that results from private property in land makes it seem
    as if there is not room enough and work enough for those already here.</p>
  <p>Or go to the Antipodes, and in Australia, as in England, you may see that
    private property in land is operating to leave the land barren and to crowd
    the bulk of the population into great cities. Go wherever you please where
    the forces loosed by modern invention are beginning to be felt and you may
    see that private property in land is the curse, denounced by the prophet,
    that prompts men to lay field to field till they &#8220;alone dwell in the
    midst of the earth.</p>
  <p>To the mere materialist this is sin and shame. Shall we to whom this world
    is God&#8217;s world &#8212; we who hold that man is called to this life
    only as a prelude to a higher life &#8212; shall we defend it?</p>
  <p><strong><em>4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself.</em></strong> (9-10.)</p>
  <p>Your Holiness next contends that industry expended on land gives a right
    to ownership of the land, and that the improvement of land creates benefits
    indistinguishable and inseparable from the land itself.</p>
  <p>This contention, if valid, could only justify the ownership of land by those
    who expend industry on it. It would not justify private property in land
    as it exists. On the contrary, it would justify a gigantic no-rent declaration
    that would take land from those who now legally own it, the landlords, and
    turn it over to the tenants and laborers. And if it also be that improvements
    cannot be distinguished and separated from the land itself, how could the
    landlords claim consideration even for improvements they had made?</p>
  <p>But your Holiness cannot mean what your words imply. What you really mean,
    I take it, is that the original justification and title of landownership
    is in the expenditure of labor on it. But neither can this justify private
    property in land as it exists. For is it not all but universally true that
    existing land titles do not come from use, but from force or fraud?</p>
  <p>Take Italy! Is it not true that the greater part of the land of Italy is
    held by those who so far from ever having expended industry on it have been
    mere appropriators of the industry of those who have? Is this not also true
    of Great Britain and of other countries? Even in the United States, where
    the forces of concentration have not yet had time fully to operate and there
    has been some attempt to give land to users, it is probably true today that
    the greater part of the land is held by those who neither use it nor propose
    to use it themselves, but merely hold it to compel others to pay them for
    permission to use it.</p>
  <p>And if industry give ownership to land what are the limits of this ownership?
    If a man may acquire the ownership of several square miles of land by grazing
    sheep on it, does this give to him and his heirs the ownership of the same
    land when it is found to contain rich mines, or when by the growth of population
    and the progress of society it is needed for farming, for gardening, for
    the close occupation of a great city? Is it on the rights given by the industry
    of those who first used it for grazing cows or growing potatoes that you
    would found the title to the land now covered by the city of New York and
    having a value of thousands of millions of dollars?</p>
  <p>But your contention is not valid. Industry expended on land gives ownership
    in the fruits of that industry, but not in the land itself, just as industry
    expended on the ocean would give a right of ownership to the fish taken by
    it, but not a right of ownership in the ocean. Nor yet is it true that <strong>private
    ownership of land</strong> is necessary to secure the fruits of labor on land; nor
    does the improvement of land create benefits indistinguishable and inseparable
    from the land itself. That secure possession is necessary to the use and
    improvement of land I have already explained, but that ownership is not necessary
    is shown by the fact that in all civilized countries land owned by one person
    is cultivated and improved by other persons. Most of the cultivated land
    in the British Islands, as in Italy and other countries, is cultivated not
    by owners but by tenants. And so the costliest buildings are erected by those
    who are not owners of the land, but who have from the owner a mere right
    of possession for a time on condition of certain payments. Nearly the whole
    of London has been built in this way, and in New York, Chicago, Denver, San
    Francisco, Sydney and Melbourne, as well as in continental cities, the owners
    of many of the largest edifices will be found to be different persons from
    the owners of the ground. So far from the value of improvements being inseparable
    from the value of land, it is in individual transactions constantly separated.
    For instance, one-half of the land on which the immense Grand Pacific Hotel
    in Chicago stands was recently separately sold, and in Ceylon it is a not
    infrequent occurrence for one person to own a fruit-tree and another to own
    the ground in which it is implanted.</p>
  <p>There is, indeed, no improvement of land, whether it be clearing, plowing,
    manuring, cultivating, the digging of cellars, the opening of wells or the
    building of houses, that so long as its usefulness continues does not have
    a value clearly distinguishable from the value of the land. For land having
    such improvements will always sell or rent for more than similar land without
    them.</p>
  <p>If, therefore, the state levy a tax equal to what the land irrespective
    of improvement would bring, it will take the benefits of mere ownership,
    but will leave the full benefits of use and improvement, which the prevailing
    system does not do. And since the holder, who would still in form continue
    to be the owner, could at any time give or sell both possession and improvements,
    subject to future assessment by the state on the value of the land alone,
    he will be perfectly free to retain or dispose of the full amount of property
    that the exertion of his labor or the investment of his capital has attached
    to or stored up in the land.</p>
  <p>Thus, what we propose would secure, as it is impossible in any other way
    to secure, what you properly say is just and right &#8212; &#8221;that the
    results of labor should belong to him who has labored.&#8221; <strong>But
    private property in land &#8212; to allow the holder without adequate payment to
    the state to take for himself the benefit of the value that attaches to land
    with social growth and improvement &#8212; does take the results of labor
    from him who has labored, does turn over the fruits of one man&#8217;s labor
    to be enjoyed by another.</strong> For labor, as the active factor, is the producer
    of all wealth. Mere ownership produces nothing. A man might own a world,
    but so sure is the decree that &#8220;by the sweat of thy brow shalt thou
    eat bread,&#8221; that without labor he could not get a meal or provide himself
    a garment. Hence, when the owners of land, by virtue of their ownership and
    without laboring themselves, get the products of labor in abundance, these
    things must come from the labor of others, must be the fruits of others&#8217; sweat,
    taken from those who have a right to them and enjoyed by those who have no
    right to them.</p>
  <p><strong>The only utility of private ownership of land as distinguished from
      possession is the evil utility of giving to the owner products of labor
      he does not
    earn.</strong> For until land will yield to its owner some return beyond that of the
    labor and capital he expends on it &#8212; that is to say, until by sale
    or rental he can without expenditure of labor obtain from it products of
    labor, ownership amounts to no more than security of possession, and has
    no value. Its importance and value begin only when, either in the present
    or prospectively, it will yield a revenue &#8212; that is to say, will enable
    the owner as owner to obtain products of labor without exertion on his part,
    and thus to enjoy the results of others&#8217; labor.</p>
  <p>What largely keeps men from realizing the robbery involved in private property
    in land is that in the most striking cases the robbery is not of individuals,
    but of the community. For, as I have before explained, it is impossible for
    rent in the economic sense &#8212; that value which attaches to land by reason
    of social growth and improvement &#8212; to go to the user. It can go only
    to the owner or to the community. Thus those who pay enormous rents for the
    use of land in such centers as London or New York are not individually injured.
    Individually they get a return for what they pay, and must feel that they
    have no better right to the use of such peculiarly advantageous localities
    without paying for it than have thousands of others. And so, not thinking
    or not caring for the interests of the community, they make no objection
    to the system.</p>
  <p>It recently came to light in New York that a man having no title whatever
    had been for years collecting rents on a piece of land that the growth of
    the city had made very valuable. Those who paid these rents had never stopped
    to ask whether he had any right to them. They felt that they had no right
    to land that so many others would like to have, without paying for it, and
    did not think of, or did not care for, the rights of all.</p>
  <p>    <em><strong>5. That private property in land has the support of the common
      opinion of mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that
      it is sanctioned
      by Divine Law.</strong></em> (11.)</p>
  <p>Even were it true that the common opinion of mankind has sanctioned private
    property in land, this would no more prove its justice than the once universal
    practice of the known world would have proved the justice of slavery.</p>
  <p>But it is not true. Examination will show that wherever we can trace them
    the first perceptions of mankind have always recognized the equality of right
    to land, and that when individual possession became necessary to secure the
    right of ownership in things produced by labor some method of securing equality,
    sufficient in the existing state of social development, was adopted. Thus,
    among some peoples, land used for cultivation was periodically divided, land
    used for pasturage and wood being held in common. Among others, every family
    was permitted to hold what land it needed for a dwelling and for cultivation,
    but the moment that such use and cultivation stopped any one else could step
    in and take it on like tenure. Of the same nature were the land laws of the
    Mosaic code. The land, first fairly divided among the people, was made inalienable
    by the provision of the jubilee, under which, if sold, it reverted every
    fiftieth year to the children of its original possessors.</p>
  <p><strong>Private property in land as we know it, the attaching to land of
      the same right of ownership that justly attaches to the products of labor,
      has never
    grown up anywhere save by usurpation or force.</strong> Like slavery, it is the result
    of war. It comes to us of the modern world from your ancestors, the Romans,
    whose civilization it corrupted and whose empire it destroyed.</p>
  <p>It made with the freer spirit of the northern peoples the combination of
    the feudal system, in which, though subordination was substituted for equality,
    there was still a rough recognition of the principle of common rights in
    land. A fief was a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed some obligation. The
    sovereign, the representative of the whole people, was the only owner of
    land. Of him, immediately or mediately, held tenants, whose possession involved
    duties or payments, which, though rudely and imperfectly, embodied the idea
    that we would carry out in the single tax, of taking land values for public
    uses. The crown lands maintained the sovereign and the civil list; the church
    lands defrayed the cost of public worship and instruction, of the relief
    of the sick, the destitute and the wayworn; while the military tenures provided
    for public defense and bore the costs of war. A fourth and very large portion
    of the land remained in common, the people of the neighborhood being free
    to pasture it, cut wood on it, or put it to other common uses.</p>
  <p>In this partial yet substantial recognition of <strong>common rights to
      land</strong> is
    to be found the reason why, in a time when the industrial arts were rude,
    wars frequent, and the great discoveries and inventions of our time unthought
    of, the condition of the laborer was devoid of that grinding poverty which
    despite our marvelous advances now exists. Speaking of England, the highest
    authority on such subjects, the late Professor Therold Rogers, declares that
      <strong>in the thirteenth century there was no class so poor, so helpless,
      so pressed and degraded as are millions of Englishmen in our boasted nineteenth
      century;
    and that, save in times of actual famine, there was no laborer so poor as
    to fear that his wife and children might come to want even were he taken
    from them. </strong>Dark and rude in many respects as they were, these were the times
    when the cathedrals and churches and religious houses whose ruins yet excite
    our admiration were built; the times when England had no national debt, no
    poor law, no standing army, no hereditary paupers, no thousands and thousands
    of human beings rising in the morning without knowing where they might lay
    their heads at night.</p>
  <p>With the decay of the feudal system, the system of private property in land
    that had destroyed Rome was extended. As to England, it may briefly be said
    that the crown lands were for the most part given away to favorites; that
    the church lands were parceled among his courtiers by Henry VIII., and in
    Scotland grasped by the nobles; that the military dues were finally remitted
    in the seventeenth century, and taxation on consumption substituted; and
    that by a process beginning with the Tudors and extending to our own time
    all but a mere fraction of the commons were inclosed by the greater landowners;
    while the same <strong>private ownership of land</strong> was extended over Ireland and the
    Scottish Highlands, partly by the sword and partly by bribery of the chiefs.<strong>    Even the military dues, had they been commuted, not remitted, would today
    have more than sufficed to pay all public expenses without one penny of other
    taxation.</strong></p>
  <p>Of the New World, whose institutions but continue those of Europe, it is
    only necessary to say that to the parceling out of land in great tracts is
    due the backwardness and turbulence of Spanish America; that to the large
    plantations of the Southern States of the Union was due the persistence of
    slavery there, and that the more northern settlements showed the earlier
    English feeling, land being fairly well divided and the attempts to establish
    manorial estates coming to little or nothing. In this lies the secret of
    the more vigorous growth of the Northern States. But the idea that land was
    to be treated as private property had been thoroughly established in English
    thought before the colonial period ended, and it has been so treated by the
    United States and by the several States. And though land was at first sold
    cheaply, and then given to actual settlers, it was also sold in large quantities
    to speculators, given away in great tracts for railroads and other purposes,
    until now the public domain of the United States, which a generation ago
    seemed illimitable, has practically gone. And this, as the experience of
    other countries shows, is the natural result in a growing community of making
    land private property. When the possession of land means the gain of unearned
    wealth, the strong and unscrupulous will secure it. But when, as we propose,
    economic rent, the &#8220;unearned increment of wealth,&#8221; is taken by
    the state for the use of the community, then land will pass into the hands
    of users and remain there, since no matter how great its value, its possession
    will be profitable only to users.</p>
  <p><strong>As to private property in land having conduced to the peace and tranquillity
    of human life, it is not necessary more than to allude to the notorious fact
    that the struggle for land has been the prolific source of wars and of lawsuits,
    while it is the poverty engendered by private property in land that makes
    the prison and the workhouse the unfailing attributes of what we call Christian
    civilization.</strong></p>
  <p>Your Holiness intimates that the Divine Law gives its sanction to the private
    ownership of land, quoting from Deuteronomy, <em>&#8220;Thou shalt not covet
    thy neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his house, nor his field, nor his man-servant,
    nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything which is his.&#8221;</em></p>
  <p><em>If, as your Holiness conveys, this inclusion of the words, &#8220;nor his
    field,&#8221; is to be taken as sanctioning private property in land as it
    exists today, then, but with far greater force, must the words, &#8220;his
    man-servant, nor his maid-servant,&#8221; be taken to sanction chattel slavery;
    for it is evident from other provisions of the same code that these terms
    referred both to bondsmen for a term of years and to perpetual slaves. </em>But
    the word &#8220;field&#8221; involves the idea of use and improvement, to
    which the right of possession and ownership does attach without recognition
    of property in the land itself. And that this reference to the &#8220;field&#8221; is
    not a sanction of private property in land as it exists today is proved by
    the fact that the Mosaic code expressly denied such unqualified ownership
    in land, and with the declaration, &#8220;the land also shall not be sold
    forever, because it is mine, and you are strangers and sojourners with me,&#8221; provided
    for its reversion every fiftieth year; thus, in a way adapted to the primitive
    industrial conditions of the time, securing to all of the chosen people a
    foothold in the soil.</p>
  <p>Nowhere in fact throughout the Scriptures can the slightest justification
    be found for the attaching to land of the same right of property that justly
    attaches to the things produced by labor. Everywhere is it treated as the
    free bounty of God, &#8220;the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.&#8221;</p>
  <p>    <em><strong>6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private
      property in land is necessary to enable them to do so.</strong></em> (14-17.)</p>
  <p>With all that your Holiness has to say of the sacredness of the family relation
    we are in full accord. <strong>But how the obligation of the father to the
    child can justify private property in land we cannot see. </strong>You reason that private
    property in land is necessary to the discharge of the duty of the father,
    and is therefore requisite and just, because &#8212;</p>
  <p>It is a most sacred law of nature that a father must provide food and all
    necessaries for those whom he has begotten; and, similarly, nature dictates
    that a man&#8217;s children, who carry on, as it were, and continue his own
    personality, should be provided by him with all that is needful to enable
    them honorably to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life. Now, in no other way can a father effect this except
    by the ownership of profitable property, which he can transmit to his children
    by inheritance. (14.)</p>
  <p>Thanks to Him who has bound the generations of men together by a provision
    that brings the tenderest love to greet our entrance into the world and soothes
    our exit with filial piety, it is both the duty and the joy of the father
    to care for the child till its powers mature, and afterwards in the natural
    order it becomes the duty and privilege of the child to be the stay of the
    parent. This is the natural reason for that relation of marriage, the groundwork
    of the sweetest, tenderest and purest of human joys, which the Catholic Church
    has guarded with such unremitting vigilance.</p>
  <p>We do, for a few years, need the providence of our fathers after the flesh.
    But how small, how transient, how narrow is this need, as compared with our
    constant need for the providence of Him in whom we live, move and have our
    being &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven! It is to him, &#8220;the giver
    of every good and perfect gift,&#8221; and not to our fathers after the flesh,
    that Christ taught us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; And
    how true it is that it is through him that the generations of men exist!
    Let the mean temperature of the earth rise or fall a few degrees, an amount
    as nothing compared with differences produced in our laboratories, and mankind
    would disappear as ice disappears under a tropical sun, would fall as the
    leaves fall at the touch of frost. Or, let for two or three seasons the earth
    refuse her increase, and how many of our millions would remain alive?</p>
  <p>The duty of fathers to transmit to their children profitable property that
    will enable them to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life! What is not possible cannot be a duty. <strong>And how
    is it possible for fathers to do that? Your Holiness has not considered how
    mankind
    really lives from hand to mouth, getting each day its daily bread; how little
    one generation does or can leave another. It is doubtful if the wealth of
    the civilized world all told amounts to anything like as much as one year&#8217;s
    labor, while it is certain that if labor were to stop and men had to rely
    on existing accumulation, it would be only a few days ere in the richest
    countries pestilence and famine would stalk.</strong></p>
  <p>      <strong>The profitable property your Holiness refers to, is private
      property in land. </strong>Now profitable land, as all economists will agree, is land superior
        to the
      land that the ordinary man can get. It is land that will yield an income
      to the owner as owner, and therefore that will permit the owner to appropriate
      the products of labor without doing labor, its profitableness to the individual
      involving the robbery of other individuals. It is therefore possible only
      for <em>some</em> fathers to leave their children profitable land. What therefore
      your Holiness practically declares is, that it is the duty of all fathers
      to struggle to leave their children what only the few peculiarly strong,
      lucky or unscrupulous can leave; and that, a something that involves the
      robbery of others &#8212; their deprivation of the material gifts of God.</p>
  <p>This anti-Christian doctrine has been long in practice throughout the Christian
    world. What are its results?</p>
  <p><strong>Are they not the very evils set forth in your Encyclical? </strong>Are they not,
    so far from enabling men to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life, to condemn the great masses of men to want and misery
    that the natural conditions of our mortal life do not entail; to want and
    misery deeper and more wide-spread than exist among heathen savages? <strong>Under
    the r&eacute;gime of private property in land and in the richest countries
    not five per cent of fathers are able at their death to leave anything substantial
    to their children, and probably a large majority do not leave enough to bury
    them! </strong>Some few children are left by their fathers richer than it is good
    for them to be, but the vast majority not only are left nothing by their
    fathers, but by the system that makes land private property are deprived
    of the bounty of their Heavenly Father; are compelled to sue others for permission
    to live and to work, and to toil all their lives for a pittance that often
    does not enable them to escape starvation and pauperism.</p>
  <p><strong>What your Holiness is actually, though of course inadvertently,
      urging, is that earthly fathers should assume the functions of the Heavenly
      Father. </strong>It is not the business of one generation to provide the succeeding generation &#8220;with
    all that is needful to enable them honorably to keep themselves from want
    and misery.&#8221; That is God&#8217;s business. We no more create our children
    than we create our fathers. It is God who is the Creator of each succeeding
    generation as fully as of the one that preceded it. And, to recall your own
    words (7), &#8220;Nature [God], therefore, owes to man a storehouse that
    shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds
    only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; What you are now
    assuming is, that it is the duty of men to provide for the wants of their
    children by appropriating this storehouse and depriving other men&#8217;s
    children of the unfailing supply that God has provided for all.</p>
  <p>The duty of the father to the child &#8212; the duty possible to all fathers!
    Is it not so to conduct himself, so to nurture and teach it, that it shall
    come to manhood with a sound body, well-developed mind, habits of virtue,
    piety and industry, and in a state of society that shall give it and all
    others free access to the bounty of God, the providence of the All-Father?</p>
  <p>In doing this the father would be doing more to secure his children from
    want and misery than is possible now to the richest of fathers &#8212; as
    much more as the providence of God surpasses that of man. For the justice
    of God laughs at the efforts of men to circumvent it, and the subtle law
    that binds humanity together poisons the rich in the sufferings of the poor.
    Even the few who are able in the general struggle to leave their children
    wealth that they fondly think will keep them from want and misery in the
    uncertainties of this mortal life &#8212; do they succeed? Does experience
    show that it is a benefit to a child to place him above his fellows and enable
    him to think God&#8217;s law of labor is not for him? Is not such wealth
    oftener a curse than a blessing, and does not its expectation often destroy
    filial love and bring dissensions and heartburnings into families? And how
    far and how long are even the richest and strongest able to exempt their
    children from the common lot? Nothing is more certain than that the blood
    of the masters of the world flows today in lazzaroni and that the descendants
    of kings and princes tenant slums and workhouses.</p>
  <p>But in the state of society we strive for, where the monopoly and waste
    of God&#8217;s bounty would be done away with and the fruits of labor would
    go to the laborer, it would be within the ability of all to make more than
    a comfortable living with reasonable labor. And for those who might be crippled
    or incapacitated, or deprived of their natural protectors and breadwinners,
    the most ample provision could be made out of that great and increasing fund
    with which God in his law of rent has provided society &#8212; not as a matter
    of niggardly and degrading alms, but as a matter of right, as the assurance
    which in a Christian state society owes to all its members.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the duty of the father, the obligation to the child, instead
    of giving any support to private property in land, utterly condemns it, urging
    us by the most powerful considerations to abolish it in the simple and efficacious
    way of the single tax.</p>
  <p>This duty of the father, this obligation to children, is not confined to
    those who have actually children of their own, but rests on all of us who
    have come to the powers and responsibilities of manhood.</p>
  <p>For did not Christ set a little child in the midst of the disciples, saying
    to them that the angels of such little ones always behold the face of his
    Father; saying to them that it were better for a man to hang a millstone
    about his neck and plunge into the uttermost depths of the sea than to injure
    such a little one?</p>
  <p>And what today is the result of private property in land in the richest
    of so-called Christian countries? Is it not that young people fear to marry;
    that married people fear to have children; that children are driven out of
    life from sheer want of proper nourishment and care, or compelled to toil
    when they ought to be at school or at play; that great numbers of those who
    attain maturity enter it with under-nourished bodies, overstrained nerves,
    undeveloped minds &#8212; under conditions that foredoom them, not merely
    to suffering, but to crime; that fit them in advance for the prison and the
    brothel?</p>
  <p>If your Holiness will consider these things we are confident that instead
    of defending private property in land you will condemn it with anathema!</p>
  <p>    <em><strong>7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases
      wealth, and attaches men to the soil and to their country</strong></em>. (51.)</p>
  <p>The idea, as expressed by Arthur Young, that &#8220;the magic of property
    turns barren sands to gold&#8221; springs from <strong>the confusion of ownership
    with possession, of which I have before spoken, that attributes to private
    property in land what is due to security of the products of labor.</strong> It is
    needless for me again to point out that the change we propose, the taxation
    for public uses of land values, or economic rent, and the abolition of other
    taxes, would give to the user of land far greater security for the fruits
    of his labor than the present system and far greater permanence of possession.
    Nor is it necessary further to show how it would give homes to those who
    are now homeless and bind men to their country. <strong>For under it every
    one who wanted a piece of land for a home or for productive use could get
    it without
    purchase price and hold it even without tax</strong>, since the tax we propose would
    not fall on all land, nor even on all land in use, but only on land better
    than the poorest land in use, and is in reality not a tax at all, but merely
    a return to the state for the use of a valuable privilege. And even those
    who from circumstances or occupation did not wish to make permanent use of
    land would still have an equal interest with all others in the land of their
    country and in the general prosperity.</p>
  <p>But I should like your Holiness to consider how utterly unnatural is the
    condition of the masses in the richest and most progressive of Christian
    countries; how large bodies of them live in habitations in which a rich man
    would not ask his dog to dwell; how the great majority have no homes from
    which they are not liable on the slightest misfortune to be evicted; how
    numbers have no homes at all, but must seek what shelter chance or charity
    offers. I should like to ask your Holiness to consider how the great majority
    of men in such countries have no interest whatever in what they are taught
    to call their native land, for which they are told that on occasions it is
    their duty to fight or to die. What right, for instance, have the majority
    of your countrymen in the land of their birth? Can they live in Italy outside
    of a prison or a poorhouse except as they buy the privilege from some of
    the exclusive owners of Italy? Cannot an Englishman, an American, an Arab
    or a Japanese do as much? May not what was said centuries ago by Tiberius
    Gracchus be said today: &#8220;Men of Rome! you are called the lords of the
    world, yet have no right to a square foot of its soil! The wild beasts have
    their dens, but the soldiers of Italy have only water and air!&#8221;</p>
  <p>What is true of Italy is true of the civilized world &#8212; is becoming
    increasingly true. It is the inevitable effect as civilization progresses
    of private property in land.</p>
  <p>    <em><strong>8. That the right to possess private property in land is from
      nature, not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that
      to take the
      value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
      owner. </strong></em>(51.)</p>
  <p>This, like much else that your Holiness says, is masked in the use of the
    indefinite terms &#8220;private property&#8221; and &#8220;private owner&#8221; &#8212; a
    want of precision in the use of words that has doubtless aided in the confusion
    of your own thought. But the context leaves no doubt that by private property
    you mean private property in land, and by private owner, the private owner
    of land.</p>
  <p><strong>The contention, thus made, that private property in land is from
      nature, not from man, has no other basis than the confounding of ownership
      with possession
    and the ascription to property in land of what belongs to its contradictory,
    property in the proceeds of labor. </strong>You do not attempt to show for it any
    other basis, nor has any one else ever attempted to do so. That private property
    in the products of labor is from nature is clear, for nature gives such things
    to labor and to labor alone. Of every article of this kind, we know that
    it came into being as nature&#8217;s response to the exertion of an individual
    man or of individual men &#8212; given by nature directly and exclusively
    to him or to them. Thus there inheres in such things a right of private property,
    which originates from and goes back to the source of ownership, the maker
    of the thing. This right is anterior to the state and superior to its enactments,
    so that, as we hold, it is a violation of natural right and an injustice
    to the private owner for the state to tax the processes and products of labor.
    They do not belong to Caesar. They are things that God, of whom nature is
    but an expression, gives to those who apply for them in the way he has appointed &#8212; by
    labor.</p>
  <p><strong>But who will dare trace the individual ownership of land to any
      grant from the Maker of land? </strong>What does nature give to such ownership? how does she
    in any way recognize it? Will any one show from difference of form or feature,
    of stature or complexion, from dissection of their bodies or analysis of
    their powers and needs, that one man was intended by nature to own land and
    another to live on it as his tenant? That which derives its existence from
    man and passes away like him, which is indeed but the evanescent expression
    of his labor, man may hold and transfer as the exclusive property of the
    individual; but how can such individual ownership attach to land, which existed
    before man was, and which continues to exist while the generations of men
    come and go &#8212; the unfailing storehouse that the Creator gives to man
    for &#8220;the daily supply of his daily wants&#8221;?<br>
    <strong>Clearly, the private ownership of land is from the state, not from
    nature.</strong>    Thus, not merely can no objection be made on the score of morals when it
    is proposed that the state shall abolish it altogether, but insomuch as it
    is a violation of natural right, its existence involving a gross injustice
    on the part of the state, an &#8220;impious violation of the benevolent intention
    of the Creator,&#8221; it is a moral duty that the state so abolish it.</p>
  <p><strong>So far from there being anything unjust in taking the full value
      of landownership for the use of the community, the real injustice is in
      leaving it in private
    hands &#8212; an injustice that amounts to robbery and murder.</strong></p>
  <p>And when your Holiness shall see this I have no fear that you will listen
    for one moment to the impudent plea that before the community can take what
    God intended it to take &#8212; before men who have been disinherited of
    their natural rights can be restored to them, the present owners of land
    shall first be compensated.</p>
  <p>For not only will you see that the single tax will directly and largely
    benefit small landowners, whose interests as laborers and capitalists are
    much greater than their interests as landowners, and that though the great
    landowners &#8212; or rather the propertied class in general among whom the
    profits of landownership are really divided through mortgages, rent-charges,
    etc. &#8212; would relatively lose, they too would be absolute gainers in
    the increased prosperity and improved morals; but more quickly, more strongly,
    more peremptorily than from any calculation of gains or losses would your
    duty as a man, your faith as a Christian, forbid you to listen for one moment
    to any such paltering with right and wrong.</p>
  <p>Where the state takes some land for public uses it is only just that those
    whose land is taken should be compensated, otherwise some landowners would
    be treated more harshly than others. But where, by a measure affecting all
    alike, rent is appropriated for the benefit of all, there can be no claim
    to compensation. Compensation in such case would be a continuance of the
    same in another form &#8212; the giving to landowners in the shape of interest
    of what they before got as rent. Your Holiness knows that justice and injustice
    are not thus to be juggled with, and when you fully realize that land is
    really the storehouse that God owes to all his children, you will no more
    listen to any demand for compensation for restoring it to them than Moses
    would have listened to a demand that Pharaoh should be compensated before
    letting the children of Israel go.</p>
  <p>Compensated for what? For giving up what has been unjustly taken? The demand
    of landowners for compensation is not that. We do not seek to spoil the Egyptians.
    We do not ask that what has been unjustly taken from laborers shall be restored.
    We are willing that bygones should be bygones and to leave dead wrongs to
    bury their dead. We propose to let those who by the past appropriation of
    land values have taken the fruits of labor to retain what they have thus
    got. We merely propose that for the future such robbery of labor shall cease &#8212; that
    for the future, not for the past, landholders shall pay to the community
    the rent that to the community is justly due. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>... How true this is we may see in the facts of today. <strong>In our own
      time invention and discovery have enormously increased the productive power
      of labor, and
    at the same time greatly reduced the cost of many things necessary to the
    support of the laborer. Have these improvements anywhere raised the earnings
    of the mere laborer? Have not their benefits mainly gone to the owners of
    land &#8212; enormously increased land values?</strong></p>
  <p>I say mainly, for some part of the benefit has gone to the cost of monstrous
    standing armies and warlike preparations; to the payment of interest on great
    public debts; and, largely disguised as interest on fictitious capital, to
    the owners of monopolies other than that of land. But improvements that would
    do away with these wastes would not benefit labor; they would simply increase
    the profits of landowners. Were standing armies and all their incidents abolished,
    were all monopolies other than that of land done away with, were governments
    to become models of economy, were the profits of speculators, of middlemen,
    of all sorts of exchangers saved, were every one to become so strictly honest
    that no policemen, no courts, no prisons, no precautions against dishonesty
    would be needed &#8212; the result would not differ from that which has followed
    the increase of productive power.</p>
  <p>Nay, would not these very blessings bring starvation to many of those who
    now manage to live? Is it not true that if there were proposed today, what
    all Christian men ought to pray for, the complete disbandment of all the
    armies of Europe, the greatest fears would be aroused for the consequences
    of throwing on the labor-market so many unemployed laborers?</p>
  <p>The explanation of this and of similar paradoxes that in our time perplex
    on every side may be easily seen. The effect of all inventions and improvements
    that increase productive power, that save waste and economize effort, is
    to lessen the labor required for a given result, and thus to save labor,
    so that we speak of them as labor-saving inventions or improvements. Now,
    in a natural state of society where the rights of all to the use of the earth
    are acknowledged, labor-saving improvements might go to the very utmost that
    can be imagined without lessening the demand for men, since in such natural
    conditions the demand for men lies in their own enjoyment of life and the
    strong instincts that the Creator has implanted in the human breast. <strong>But
    in that unnatural state of society where the masses of men are disinherited
    of all but the power to labor when opportunity to labor is given them by
    others, there the demand for them becomes simply the demand for their services
    by those who hold this opportunity, and man himself becomes a commodity.</strong>    Hence, although the natural effect of labor-saving improvement is to increase
    wages, yet in the unnatural condition which private ownership of the land
    begets, the effect, even of such moral improvements as the disbandment of
    armies and the saving of the labor that vice entails, is, by lessening the
    commercial demand, to lower wages and reduce mere laborers to starvation
    or pauperism. <strong>If labor-saving inventions and improvements could be
    carried to the very abolition of the necessity for labor, what would be the
    result?
    Would it not be that landowners could then get all the wealth that the land
    was capable of producing,</strong> and would have no need at all for laborers, who
    must then either starve or live as pensioners on the bounty of the landowners?</p>
  <p><strong>Thus, so long as private property in land continues &#8212; so long
      as some men are treated as owners of the earth and other men can live on
      it only
    by their sufferance &#8212; human wisdom can devise no means by which the
    evils of our present condition may be avoided. </strong>... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nevertheless, there is a
Middle Way. There is a body of
socio-economic truth which incorporates the best insights of both
Capitalism and Socialism. </b>Yet they are not insights that are
artificially woven together to form a deliberate compromise. Instead,
they arise naturally, with a kind of inner logic, from the profound
ethical distinction which is the system's core. They arise
remorselessly from an understanding of the meaning of the
commandment: "Thou shalt not steal." This Middle Way is the
philosophy associated with the name of Henry George.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>I like to picture economic
theory as a vast jigsaw puzzle

many false pieces, also distributed across both tables. Most of us
are either perceptively limited to one table, or else we are unable
to distinguish the genuine pieces from the false. But Henry George
knew how to find the right pieces, and, therefore, he was able to put
the puzzle together -- at least in its general outlines. I don't
claim that he was infallible, or that there isn't further work to be
done. Yet if I find a little piece of puzzle missing here or there,
it doesn't shake my confidence in the harmony of the overall pattern
he discerned. It doesn't make me want to sweep the puzzle onto the
floor and start all over again from scratch.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Let us return now to our
illustration of the
economic jigsaw puzzle, and take a look at the pieces which he
selected from the two tables of Capitalism and Socialism. ... </b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We will begin with the Capitalist
table. George considered himself
a purifier of Capitalism, not its enemy. He built upon the
foundations laid by the classical economists. The skeleton of his
system is essentially Capitalist. In fact, Karl Marx referred to
George's teaching as "Capitalism's last ditch." George believed in
competition, in the free market, in the unrestricted operation of the
laws of supply and demand. He distrusted government and despised
bureaucracy. He was no egalitarian leveler; the only equality he
sought was equal freedom of opportunity. Actually, what he intended
was to make free enterprise truly free, by ridding it of the
monopolistic hobbles which prevent its effective operation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his book, <b><i>The Condition
of Labor</i></b>, George said:
"We differ from the Socialists in our diagnosis of the evil, and we
differ from them in remedies.

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

as the free circulation of the blood is to the bodily organism -- to
be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation is to be secured."</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Why did George take so many
pieces from the Capitalist table?
Because, I think, they are all corollaries of one big piece, namely,
the moral justification for private property. </b>You see, George,
who was a devout though non-sectarian Christian, had a stout belief
in the God-given dignity of the individual. This dignity, he held,
demands that we recognize that the individual possesses an absolute
and inalienable right to himself, which is forfeited only when he
refuses to accord the same right to others. The right to one's self
implies the right to one's labor, which is an extension of one's
self, and therefore to the product of one's labor -- to use it, to
enjoy it, to give it away, to destroy it, to bequeath it, or even (if
one so desires) to bury it in the ground. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In fitting together the economic
jigsaw puzzle, George took only
two pieces from the Socialist table. But what large and what
strategic pieces they were! </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The first of these was his insistence that all persons
come into
the world with an equal right of access to the goods of nature. </small></li>
  <li><small>The second was his contention that the community has a
right to
take that which the community produces.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Actually, these pieces had landed
on the Socialist table only by
default. They had originally been part of the theory of Capitalism,
as outlined by John Locke, the Physiocrats, and Adam Smith. But
Capitalism in practice ignored them, and so became a distorted
caricature. George's notion was to rescue these lost elements, and
restore balance and proportion to the Capitalist table.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Now, if private property derives
its moral justification from the
right of a human being to the fruits of his or her own efforts,
clearly the land and the other goods of nature do not belong in the
category of private property because no human efforts created them.
</span>And the value that attaches to them is not the result of
anything
their title-holder does to them; it is the result of the presence and
activity of the community around them. Someone can build a skyscraper
in the desert and the ground upon which it stands will not be worth a
penny more because of it, yet a city lot with nothing on it may be
worth a fortune simply because of the number of people who pass by it
daily.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Why, asked Henry George in
effect, should private individuals
be allowed to fatten upon the unearned increment of land -- upon the
rise in value which the community creates because of population
increase and the growth of public services? </b>Why should certain
people be allowed to levy tribute upon others who desire access to
their common heritage? But, you might object, the present owner may
have paid hard-earned money for his land. Has he not, therefore, a
vested right? To this, George would have answered: If one unwittingly
buys stolen goods, the rectitude of one's intentions establishes no
right against the legitimate owner of those goods.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George was not the first
thinker to comprehend the difference between land and other kinds of
property. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>John Locke said that "God gave the world in common to all
mankind.... When the 'sacredness' of property is talked of, it should
be remembered that any such sacredness does not belong in the same
degree to landed property."    </small></li>
  <li><small>William Blackstone wrote: "The earth, and all things
therein, are the general property of all man-kind, from the immediate
gift of the Creator."    </small></li>
  <li><small>Thomas Paine stated that "men did not make the earth... It
is the value of the improvements only, and not the earth itself, that
is individual property."    </small></li>
  <li><small>According to Thomas Jefferson, "The earth is given as a
common stock for men to labor and live on."</small></li>
  <li><small>John Stuart Mill wrote: "The increase in the value of
land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold
title."    </small></li>
  <li><small>Abraham Lincoln said: "The land, the earth God gave to man
for his home, sustenance, and support, should never be the possession
of any man, corporation, society, or unfriendly government, any more
than the air or water, if as much."    </small></li>
  <li><small>In the words of Herbert Spencer, "equity does not permit
property in land ... The world is God's bequest to mankind. All men are
joint heirs to it."    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But it was Henry George who
emphasized this distinction and placed it at the very center of his
system.<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> At
present we have the ironic spectacle of the community penalizing the
individual for his industry and initiative, and taking away from him a
share of that which he produces, while at the same time lavishing upon
the nonproducer undeserved windfalls which it -- the community --
produces.</span> Henry George built his whole program around the
principle: Let the individual keep all of that which he or she
produces, and let the community keep all of that which it
produces.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Andelson_HGRC.html"><span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy Kingdom Come</a>
(1889 speech)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Mr Abner Thomas, of New York, a
strict orthodox Presbyterian
&#8212; and the son of Rev Dr Thomas, author of a commentary on the
bible &#8212; wrote a little while ago an allegory. Dozing off in his
chair, he dreamt that he was ferried over the River of Death, and,
taking the straight and narrow way, came at last within sight of the
Golden City. A fine-looking old gentleman angel opened the wicket,
inquired his name, and let him in; warning him, at the same time,
that it would be better if he chose his company in heaven, and did
not associate with disreputable angels. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What!&#8221; said the newcomer, in
astonishment: &#8220;Is
not this heaven?&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;But
there are a lot of
tramp angels here now." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;How can that be?&#8221; asked Mr
Thomas. &#8220;I thought
everybody had plenty in heaven.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;It used to be that way some time
ago,&#8221; said the
warden: &#8220;And if you wanted to get your harp polished or your
wings combed, you had to do it yourself. But matters have changed
since we adopted the same kind of property regulations in heaven as
you have in civilised countries on earth, and we find it a great
improvement, at least for the better class.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the warden told the newcomer
that he had better decide
where he was going to board.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
to board anywhere,&#8221; said Thomas:
&#8220;I would much rather go over to that beautiful green knoll and
lie down.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I would not
advise you to do so,&#8221; said the warden:
&#8220;The angel who owns that knoll does not like to encourage
trespassing. Some centuries ago, as I told you, we introduced the
system of private property into the soil of heaven. So we divided the
land up. It is all private property now.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I hope I was
considered in that division?&#8221; said
Thomas. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
&#8220;No,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;You were not; but if you
go to work, and are saving, you can easily earn enough in a couple of
centuries to buy yourself a nice piece. </span>You get a pair of wings
free
as you come in, and you will have no difficulty in hypothecating them
for a few days board until you find work. But I should advise you to
be quick about it, as our population is constantly increasing, and
there is a great surplus of labour. Tramp angels are, in fact,
becoming quite a nuisance.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What shall I go to work at?&#8221;
asked Thomas. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Our principal industries are the
making of harps and
crowns and the growing of flowers,&#8221; responded the warden:
&#8220;But there any many opportunities for employment in personal
service.&#8221;</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I love
flowers,&#8221; said Thomas. &#8220;I will go to work
growing them, There is a beautiful piece of land over there that
nobody seems to be using. I will go to work on that.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;You can&#8217;t do
that,&#8221; said the warden. &#8220;That
property belongs to one of our most far-sighted angels who has got
very rich by the advance of land values, and who is holding that
piece for a rise. You will have to buy it or rent it before you can
work on it, and you can&#8217;t do that yet.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The story goes on to describe how
the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You laugh, and it is ridiculous.
But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven?&nbsp; ... <a

fundamental evil, the great God-denying
crime of society, is the iniquitous system under which men are
permitted to put into their pocket, confiscate, in fact, the
community-made values of land, while organized society confiscates for
public purposes a part of the wealth created by individuals. Do you
agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Using a concrete illustration: I own in the city of Philadelphia
11-1/2
acres of land, for which I paid 32,500 dollars a few years ago. On
account of increase of population and industry in Philadelphia, that
land is now worth about 125,000 dollars. I have expended no labor or
money upon it. So I have done nothing to cause that increase of 92,500
dollars in a few years. My fellow-citizens in Philadelphia created it,
and I believe it therefore belongs to them, not to me. I believe that
the man-made law which gives to me and other landlords values we have
not created is a violation of the divine law. I believe that Justice
demands that these community-made values be taken by the community for
common purposes instead of taxing enterprise and industry. Do you

Real Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We call ourselves the "party of
principle," and we base property
rights on the principle that everyone is entitled to the fruits of
his labor. Land, however, is not the fruit of anyone's labor, and our
system of land tenure is based not on labor, but on decrees of
privilege issued from the state, called titles. In fact, the term
"real estate" is Middle English (originally French) for "royal
state." The "title" to land is the essence of the title of nobility,
and the root of noble privilege.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The royal free lunch</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the state granted land titles
  to a fraction of the
  population, it gave that fraction devices with which to levy, and
  pocket, tolls on the fruits of the labor of others. Those without
  land privileges must either buy or rent those privileges from the
  people who received the grants or from their assignees. Thus the
  state titles enable large landowners to collect a transfer payment,
  or "free lunch" from the actual land users.</small></p>

rent.</i> --Carlyle</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Tortured
rationalizations</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>According to royal libertarians,
land becomes private property
when one mixes one's labor with it. And mixing what is yours with
what is not yours in order to own the whole thing is considered great
sport. But the notion is filled with problems. How much labor does it
take to claim land, and how much land can one claim for that labor?
And for how long can one make that claim?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>According to classical liberals,
land belonged to the user for as
long as the land was being used, and no longer. But according to
royal libertarians, land belongs to the first user, forever. So, do
the oceans belong to the heirs of the first person to take a fish out
or put a boat in? Does someone who plows the same field each year own
only one field, while someone who plows a different field each year
owns dozens of fields? Should the builder of the first
transcontinental railroad own the continent? Shouldn't we at least
have to pay a toll to cross the tracks? Are there no common rights to
the earth at all? To royal libertarians there are not, but classical
liberals recognized that unlimited ownership of land never flowed
from use, but from the state:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>A right of property in
movable things is admitted before
the establishment of government. A separate property in lands not till
after that establishment.... He who plants a field keeps possession of
it till he has gathered the produce, after which one has as good a
right as another to occupy it. Government must be established and laws
provided, before lands can be separately appropriated and their owner
protected in his possession. Till then the property is in the body of
the nation.</i> --Thomas Jefferson</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>"But we're used to
it"</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A favorite excuse of royal
libertarians is that the land has been
divided up for so long that tracing the rightful owners would be
pointless. But there can be no rightful owners if we all have an
inalienable right of access to the earth. It is not some ancient
injustice we seek to rectify, but an ongoing injustice. The piece of
paper granting title might be ancient, but the tribute levied on the
landless goes on and on.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One might as well have

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the funny thing is, you don't really believe it
yourself," says Vernon. "You aren't being consistent. You say goods and
services that we produce belong to the producers and no one else. But
you support the income tax and the sales tax. Those taxes take away
from the producer, without his or her consent, part of what he or she
produced. So it doesn't seem that you really believe your own claims.
Why should people support the Polluter Pays Principle that says they
are stuck with negative products they produce, when at the same time
you wouldn't allow them to keep the positive products they produce?
Sounds like an uneven deal."</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara is shocked. But she has to admit Vernon
has a
point. "Hmm, I guess this might be part of why the Polluter Pays
Principle doesn't excite as much support as it should. If we lived in a
world where people get to keep the full value of whatever their labor
and their investment yields, then pollution would stand out in sharp
contrast, as a crime against innocent people and their property. The
Polluter Pays Principle would be totally obvious then."</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And instead," says Vernon, "we're surrounded
by
cases of theft by income tax, by sales tax, and so on. Well then, no
wonder people aren't shocked when the Polluter Pays Principle isn't
applied. And no wonder some people don't even see the wisdom of it. "</small><br>

both, or is that inconsistent? Your opinion, please! ...<a

are not questioning the legitimacy of earnings that landholders or
others derive from buildings or production on the land. People who

  <small>IN the effects upon the distribution of wealth, of making land private
  property, we may thus see an explanation of that paradox presented by modern
  progress. The perplexing phenomena of deepening want with increasing wealth,
  of labor rendered more dependent and helpless by the very introduction of labor-saving
  machinery, are the inevitable result of natural laws as fixed and certain as
  the law of gravitation.<strong> Private property in land is the primary cause
  of the monstrous inequalities which are developing in modern society. </strong>It is this,
  and not any miscalculation of Nature in bringing into the world more mouths
  than she can feed, that gives rise to that tendency of wages to a minimum &#8211; that "iron
  law of wages," as the Germans call it -- that, in spite of all advances in
  productive power, compels the laboring-classes to the least return on which
  they will consent to live. It is this that produces all those phenomena that
  are so often attributed to the conflict of labor and capital. It is this that
  condemns Irish peasants to rags and hunger, that produces the pauperism of
  England and the tramps of America. It is this that makes the almshouse and
  the penitentiary the marks of what we call high civilization; that in the midst
  of schools and churches degrades and brutalizes men, crushes the sweetness
  out of womanhood and the joy out of childhood. It is this that makes lives
  that might be a blessing a pain and a curse, and every year drives more and
  more to seek unbidden refuge in the gates of death. For, a permanent tendency
  to inequality once set up, all the forces of progress tend to greater and greater

      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed.</p>
  <p>...As we look at the complications of our social and economic system, no
    fair-minded student can avoid the conclusion that many of the principles
    which Henry George
      expressed are applicable to it. The philosophy of Henry George is so far-reaching
      in its implications that hardly any accurate conception of it can be gathered
      from such brief remarks as are appropriate to an occasion like that which
    brings us together today. It is, therefore, possible to refer to only three
    fundamental
      principles which Henry George enunciated, and which are as vital and important
      in our world of today as they were at the time that he affirmed them. Indeed,
      if we try to envision, in view of our present location this afternoon, &quot;The
      World of Tomorrow,&quot; I have no hesitation in saying that if the world
      of tomorrow is to be a civilized world, and not a world which has relapsed
      into
      barbarism, it can be so only by applying the principles of freedom which
      Henry George taught. The principles to which I refer are:</p>
  <p>First, that men have equal rights in natural resources, and that these rights
      may find recognition in a system which gives effect to the distinction between
      what is justly private property because it has relation to individual initiative
      and is the creation of labor and capital, and what is public property because
      it is either a part of the natural resources of the country, whose value is
      created by the presence of the community, or is founded upon some governmental
      privilege or franchise.</p>
  <p>Henry George believed in an order of society in which monopoly should be abolished
      as a means of private profit. The substitution of state monopoly for private
      monopoly will not better the situation. It ignores the fact that even where
      a utility is a natural monopoly which must be operated in the public interests,
      it should be operated as a result of cooperation between the representatives
      of labor, capital. and consumers, and not by the politicians who control the
      political state.</p>
  <p>We should never lose sight of the fact that all monopolies are created and
      perpetuated by state laws. If the states wish seriously to abolish monopoly,
      they can do so by withdrawing their privileges; but they cannot grant the privileges
      which make monopoly inevitable and avoid the consequences by invoking anti-trust
      laws against them.</p>
  <p>It is strange that the state, which has assumed all sorts of functions which
      it cannot with advantage perform, still persists in neglecting a vital
    function which it should and can perform &#8212; the function of collecting
    public revenues, as far as possible, from those who reap the benefits of
    natural resources.
      In view of public and social needs, it is remarkable that no effort has
    been made by governments to reduce the tax burdens on labor and capital,
    which are
      engaged in increasing production, by transferring them to those who restrict
      production by making monopoly privileges special to themselves.</p>
  <p>These monopolistic privileges are of course disguised under many different
      forms, but the task of ascertaining what they are, and their true value, is
      a task within the competency of government if it really desires to accomplish
      it. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

  3.0 &#8212; Chapter 2: A Short History of Capitalism (pages 15-32)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginning, the commons was everywhere. Humans and other animals roamed
    around it, hunting and gathering. Like other species, we had territories,
    but these were tribal, not individual.</p>
  <p>About ten thousand years ago, human agriculture and permanent settlements
    arose, and with them came private property. Rulers granted ownership of land
    to heads of families (usually males). Often, military conquerors distributed
    land to their lieutenants. Titles could then be passed to heirs &#8212; typically,
    oldest sons got everything.</p>
  <p>In Europe, Roman law codified many of these practices. Despite the growth
    in private property, much land in Europe remained part of the commons. In
    Roman times, bodies of water, shorelines, wildlife, and air were explicitly
    classified as res communes, resources available to all. During the Middle
    Ages, kings and feudal lords often claimed title to rivers, forests, and
    wild animals, only to have such claims periodically rebuked. The Magna Carta,
    which King John of England was forced to sign in 1215, established forests
    and fisheries as res communes. Given that forests were sources of game, firewood,
    building materials, medicinal herbs, and grazing for livestock, this was
    no small shift.</p>
  <p>In the seventeenth century, John Locke sought to balance the commons and
    private property. Like others of his era, he saw that private property doesn&#8217;t
    exist in a vacuum; it exists in relationship to a commons, vis-&agrave;-vis
    which there are takings and leavings. The rationale for private property
    is that it boosts economic production, but the commons has a rationale, too:
    it provides sustenance for all. Both sides must be respected.</p>
  <p>Locke believed that God gave the earth to &#8220;mankind in common,&#8221; but
    that private property is justified because it spurs humans to work. Whenever
    a person mixes his labor with nature, he &#8220;joins to it something that
    is his own, and thereby makes it his property.&#8221; But here Locke added
    an important proviso: &#8220;For this labor being the unquestionable property
    of the laborer,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;no man but he can have a right to
    what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good,
    left in common for others.&#8221; In other words, a person can acquire property,
    but there&#8217;s a limit to how much he or she can rightfully appropriate.
    That limit is set by two considerations: first, it should be no more than
    he can join his labor to, and second, it has to leave &#8220;enough and as
    good&#8221; in common for others. This was consistent with English common
    law at the time, which held, for example, that a riparian landowner could
    withdraw water for his own use, but couldn&#8217;t diminish the supply available
    to others. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
