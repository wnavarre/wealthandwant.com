    <p>When too much of an entrepreneur's funds must be spent securing a site
      on which to do business, he has little left for equipment or wages. Land
      value taxation fixes that and levels the playing field between long-established
      businesses and newer ones.<br>

        Herbert J. G. Bab:&nbsp; <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Bab_PT_Unemployment.html">Property
      Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a>&nbsp; (circa 1964) </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Under the impact of spectacular advances in
  technology the actual level of employment and production falls short of
  the full use of our manpower and industrial capacity.</span> ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In view of this it would be
  difficult
  to contend that we have solved the twin problems of full employment and
  economic growth. The truth is that we have lived all these postwar
  years on borrowed time.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What have these
  considerations to do with property taxation? The purpose of my talk is
  to show that the relation of property taxation to unemployment and lack
  of economic growth is that of cause to effect.</span> ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Ricardo believed that ground rents and the value of land have a
  tendency to rise continuously and that this benefits solely the
  landowners. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The progress of
  industrialization and urbanization in the
  second half of the 19th century resulted in a rapid increase in the
  value of urban land and the owners of such land reaped tremendous
  profits. This led John Stuart Mill to observe, that "Only the
  landowners grow richer, as it were in their sleep without working,
  risking and economizing". He called for the taxation of land in order
  to recapture the unearned increment accruing to the land owners.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The apostle of land taxation is Henry George. In his famous book
  <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
  and Poverty</span></a> he develops
  his single tax theory. He tries to show that poverty and unemployment
  and other evils are caused by the land monopolists. Henry George's
  theory is similar to that developed by John Stuart Mill. Land values
  are based on ground rents which are created by the community and not by
  the land owners. Therefore the community is justified in recapturing
  these rents by a single tax on land. ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">An analysis of the social and
  economic
  effects of a particular tax system would indicate the third criterion.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>When analysing property taxes we shall distinguish between that
  part of
  the tax which is assessed on improvements and that part which is
  assessed on land. </small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">That part of the tax that is
  assessed on buildings penalizes everybody
  who improves his land, his buildings or intends to construct
  residential, commercial or industrial property.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A defect
  of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
  premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
  because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
  taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
  depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
  of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
  constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span></small></p>
  <p>    <small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While
  land
  values have risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land
  averaged about 1.5%. Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land
  would have earned about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from
  its proper use.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>A higher tax on vacant or unimproved land would make it
  unprofitable to
  hold such lands. It will tax land into better use and it will lead to a
  spurt in construction activity. While all other taxes are deterrents to
  employment and economic growth, though to a varying extent, land taxes
  are the only genuine incentive taxes.<strong> ... </strong></small><strong><br>
  </strong><br>
  <small>Property taxes shape the pattern of our cities. </small>... </p>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>If taxes on improvements are low or non-existing and taxes
on
land are high, the cities are bound to grow vertically and at a fast
rate. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>If taxes on improvements are high and taxes on land are
low, our
cities will spread over larger and larger areas. They will become
metropolitan areas and they will grow at a much slower rate.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Relatively low taxes on land and
high taxes on improvements will
discourage the owners of vacant lots or underdeveloped land, such as
that used for parking lots, gas stations, hamburger stands, etc., from
improving their land. It will encourage them to keep the land out of
use and to sell later at a profit. This will create an artificial
shortage of land, which in turn will lead to urban blight and
irregular, leapfrog city growth. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on
improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not
identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
  paradox of property taxation
  consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
  results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
  improvements produce the same results as lower rates on land.</span><span
