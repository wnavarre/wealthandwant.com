<blockquote>
  <p>I live in a small city which, for most of the 30 years I've lived in it,
    has had a 4+ acre hole in the ground within 1/4 mile of its 100% location!
    Sanitary
    and
    storm sewers serve it, the police and fire companies protect it, and the
    rest of us must walk or drive around it. A chain link fence surrounds it.    </p>
  <p>Whose
      interests are being served here? Not those of the tenants of the shopping
      mall on one side of it. Not those of the hotel across the street. Not those
      of the
      restaurant down the block. Not those of the apartment-dwellers nearby.
     Not those of the folks who work in the neighboring office buildings. Whose,
    then?
      The heirs of the current landholders, whose corporate mailing addresses
    are in New York City.</p>
  <p>But what can we do about it? Divorce the tax on land from the tax on buildings.
    Start decreasing the perverse tax on buildings, and start increasing the
    eminently fair tax on land values. This will light a gentle flame under those
    who fail to use their supremely well-located sites. They will either lower
    their asking price, or start figuring out how to earn some money on the land.
    Either way, the land will be put to use, creating jobs while it gets developed,
    and creating the venue for businesses which will employ people and serve
    customers, bringing prices down. </p>
  <p>And an acre downtown, well developed, will help prevent the premature development
    of 10 or more acres on the fringe. </p>

  Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I cannot go over all the points I would
    like to try, but I wish to call your attention to the utter absurdity of
    private property in land! Why, consider it, the idea of a man's selling the
    earth &#8212; the earth, our common mother. A man selling that which no man
    produced &#8212; a man passing title from one generation to another. Why,
    it is the most absurd thing in the world. Why, did you ever think of it?
    What right has a dead man to land? For whom was this earth created? It was
    created for the living, certainly, not for the dead. Well, now we treat it
    as though it was created for the dead. Where do our land titles come from?
    They come from men who for the most part are past and gone. Here in this
    new country you get a little nearer the original source; but go to the Eastern
    States and go back over the Atlantic. There you may clearly see the power
    that comes from landownership. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The utter absurdity of this thing of private
    property in land! I defy any one to show me any good from it, look where
    you please. Go out in the new lands, where my attention was first called
    to it, or go to the heart of the capital of the world &#8212; London. Everywhere,
    when your eyes are once opened, you will see its inequality and you will
    see its absurdity. You do not have to go farther than Burlington [Iowa].
    You have here a most beautiful site for a city, but the city itself as compared
    with what it might be is a miserable, straggling town. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A
    gentleman showed me today a big hole alongside one of your streets. The place
    has been filled up all around it and this hole is left. It is neither pretty
    nor useful. Why does that hole stay there? Well, it stays there because somebody
    claims it as his private property. </span>There is a man, this gentleman
    told me, who wished to grade another lot and wanted somewhere to put the
    dirt he took off it, and he offered to buy this hole so that he might fill
    it up. Now it would have been a good thing for Burlington to have it filled
    up, a good thing for you all &#8212; your town would look better, and you
    yourself would be in no danger of tumbling into it some dark night. Why,
    my friend pointed out to me another similar hole in which water had collected
    and told me that two children had been drowned there. And he likewise told
    me that a drunken man some years ago had fallen into such a hole and had
    brought suit against the city which cost you taxpayers some $11,000. Clearly
    it is to the interest of you all to have that particular hole I am talking
    of filled up. The man who wanted to fill it up offered the hole owner $300.
    But the hole owner refused the offer and declared that he would hold out
    until he could get $1000; and in the meanwhile that unsightly and dangerous
    hole must remain. This is but an illustration of private property in land. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You may see the same thing all over this
    country. See how injuriously in the agricultural districts this thing of
    private property in land affects the roads and the distances between the
    people. <b>A man does not take what land he wants, what he can use, but he
    takes all he can get, and the consequence is that his next neighbour has
    to go further along, people are separated from each other further than they
    ought to be, to the increased difficulty of production, to the loss of neighbourhood
    and companionship. They have more roads to maintain than they can decently
    maintain; they must do more work to get the same result, and life is in every
    way harder and drearier. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> When you come to the cities it is just
    the other way. In the country the people are too much scattered; in the great
    cities they are too crowded. Go to a city like New York and there they are
    jammed together like sardines in a box, living family upon family, one above
    the other. It is an unnatural and unwholesome life. How can you have anything
    like a home in a tenement room, or two or three rooms? How can children be
    brought up healthily with no place to play? Two or three weeks ago I read
    of a New York judge who fined two little boys five dollars for playing hop-scotch
    on the street&#8212;where else could they play? Private property in land
    had robbed them of all place to play. Even a temperance man, who had investigated
    the subject, said that in his opinion the gin palaces of London were a positive
    good in this, that they enabled the people whose abodes were dark and squalid
    rooms to see a little brightness and thus prevent them from going wholly
    mad.&nbsp; ... <a

  People's Land</a>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Fancy comparing these healthy
  processes with the enrichment which comes
  to the landlord who happens to own a plot of land on the outskirts or
  at the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the busy
  population around him making the city larger, richer, more convenient,
  more famous every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Roads are made, streets are made, railway
  services are improved, electric light turns night into day, electric
  trams glide swiftly to and fro, water is brought from reservoirs a
  hundred miles off in the mountains -- and all the while the landlord
  sits still. Every one of those improvements is effected by the labour
  and at the cost of other people.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Many of the most important are
  effected at the cost of the municipality and of the ratepayers. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">To not one of those improvements
  does the
  land monopolist as a land monopolist contribute, and yet by every one
  of them the value of his land is sensibly enhanced.</span> He renders
  no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general
  welfare; he contributes nothing even to the process from which his own
  enrichment is derived. If the land were occupied by shops or by
  dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon them
  in aid of the general fund, but the land may be unoccupied,
  undeveloped, it may be what is called '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ripening</span>'
  -- ripening at the expense of the whole city, of the whole country, for
  the unearned increment of its owner. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Roads
  perhaps may have to be
  diverted to avoid this forbidden area. The merchant going to his
  office, the artisan going to his work, have to make a detour or pay a
  tram fare to avoid it. The citizens are losing their chance of
  developing the land, the city is losing its rates, the State is losing
  its taxes which would have accrued if the natural development had taken
  place; and that share has to be replaced at the expense of the other
  ratepayers and taxpayers, and the nation as a whole is losing in the
  competition of the world -- the hard and growing competition of the
  world -- both in time and money. </span>And all the while the land
  monopolist
  has only to sit still and watch complacently his property multiplying
  in value, sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on
  his part; and that is justice! ... <a
