  <p>Many of my friends pride themselves on conserving water and energy, and
    endorse the idea of &quot;living simply so that others may simply live.&quot; I
    am often troubled, however, that until we get our incentives right, so that
    the big users of water and energy &#8212; not to mention the big polluters &#8212; have
    the incentives to behave similarly, my friends' individual efforts and sacrifice
    are going to be to little effect. Similarly, I see churches, synagogues and
    mosques
    being encouraged to devote themselves to charitable efforts to help the poor,
    rather than concentrating on seeking poverty's underlying causes and working
    to eradicate the structural reasons we have such widespread poverty and misery
    in a country dedicated to the proposition that all of us are created equal.
(see <a href="Fences_and_bandages.htm"> fences and bandages</a>.)</p>
  <p>We tax the wrong things &#8212; labor and capital &#8212; and  tax only
    lightly that which should be taxed heavily &#8212; land value. The effects
    are widespread
    and
    serious, and until we correct these distortions, we can't expect our efforts
    to reduce poverty or sprawl to do more than provide palliative care.</p>
  <p>Incentive Taxation is another term
    often used for Land Value Taxation,
    Site Value Taxation and Split-Rate Taxation.&nbsp; It aligns the
    incentives with the ideals we hold dear, ideals such as equality and equality

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
    article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Evidently this regard for the general good is the true principle of taxation.
      The more it is examined the more clearly it will be seen that there is
      no valid reason why we should, in any case, attempt to tax all property.
      That equality should be the rule and aim of taxation is true, and this
      for the reason given in the Declaration of Independence, that all men are
      created equal. But equality does not require that all men should be taxed
      alike, or that all things should be taxed alike. It merely requires that
      whatever taxes are imposed shall be equally imposed upon the persons or
      things in like conditions or situations; it merely requires that no citizen
      shall be given an advantage, or put at a disadvantage, as compared with
      other citizens.</p>
  <p>The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the Constitution
    of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence. To
    insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to each
    individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness &#8212; these
    are the proper ends of government, and are therefore the ends which in every
    scheme of taxation should be kept in mind.<font size="+1"><strong> ... </strong></font></p>
  <p>But while no limit can be properly fixed for the amount of taxation, the
    method of taxation is of supreme importance. A horse may be anchored by fastening
    to his bridle a weight which he will not feel when carried in a buggy behind
    him. The best ship may be made utterly unseaworthy by the bad stowage of
    a cargo which properly placed would make her the stiffer and more weatherly.
    So enterprise may be palsied, industry crushed, accumulation prevented, and
    a prosperous country turned into a desert, by taxation which rightly levied
    would hardly be felt. <font size="+1"><strong>... </strong></font><br>
  </p>
  <p>Nothing is clearer than that when a farmer who wants more capital puts a
    mortgage on his farm, no new value is thereby created. Yet, in most of our
    States, both the farm and the mortgage are taxed; though so obvious is the
    double taxation that in some of them the clumsy expedient of making an exemption
    to the debtor is resorted to.</p>
  <p>But it is manifest that property of this kind is not a fit subject for taxation,
    and ought not to be considered in making up the assessment rolls. It has,
    in itself, no value. It is merely the representative, or token, of value &#8212; the
    certificate of ownership, or the obligation to pay value. It either represents
    other property, or property yet to be brought into existence. And, as nothing
    real can be drawn from that which is not real, taxation upon property of
    this kind must ultimately fall, either upon the property represented, in
    which case there is double taxation, or upon those whose obligations it expresses,
    in which case men are taxed, not upon what they own, but upon what they owe;
    and all cumbrous devices to prevent the unjust effects of such taxation,
    like other complications of the revenue system, simply give to the stronger
    and more unscrupulous opportunities of throwing the burden upon the weaker
    and more conscientious. Property of this kind ought not to be taxed at all.
    Property in itself valuable is clearly that with which any wise scheme of
    taxation should alone deal.</p>
  <p>To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
    distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between movables
    and immovables, between personal property and real estate. The true distinction
    is between property which is, and property which is not, the result of human
    labor; or, to use the terms of political economy, between land and wealth.
    For, in any precise use of the term, land is not wealth, any more than labor
    is wealth. Land and labor are the factors of production. Wealth is such result
    of their union as retains the capacity of ministering to human desire. A
    lot and the house which stands upon it are alike property, alike have a tangible
    value, and are alike classed as real estate. But there are between them the
    most essential differences. The one is the free gift of Nature, the other
    the result of human exertion; the one exists from generation to generation,
    while men come and go; the other is constantly tending to decay, and can
    only be preserved by continual exertion. To the one, the right of exclusive
    possession, which makes it individual property, can, like the right of property
    in slaves, be traced to nothing but municipal law; to the other, the right
    of exclusive property springs clearly from those natural relations which
    are among the primary perceptions of the human mind. Nor are these mere abstract
    distinctions. They are distinctions of the first importance in determining
    what should and what should not be taxed.</p>
  <p>For, keeping in mind the fact that all wealth is the result of human exertion,
    it is clearly seen that, having in view the promotion of the general prosperity,
    it is the height of absurdity to tax wealth for purposes of revenue while
    there remains, unexhausted by taxation, any value attaching to land. We may
    tax land values as much as we please, without in the slightest degree lessening
    the amount of land, or the capabilities of land, or the inducement to use
    land. But we cannot tax wealth without lessening the inducement to the production
    of wealth, and decreasing the amount of wealth. We might take the whole value
    of land in taxation, so as to make the ownership of land worth nothing, and
    the land would still remain, and be as useful as before. The effect would
    be to throw land open to users free of price, and thus to increase its capabilities,
    which are brought out by increased population. But impose anything like such
    taxation upon wealth, and the inducement to the production of wealth would
    be gone. Movable wealth would be hidden or carried off, immovable wealth
    would be suffered to go to decay, and where was prosperity would soon be
    the silence of desolation.</p>
  <p>And the reason of this difference is clear. The possession of wealth is
    the inducement to the exertion necessary to the production and maintenance
    of wealth. Men do not work for the pleasure of working, but to get the things
    their work will give them. And to tax the things that are produced by exertion
    is to lessen the inducement to exertion. But over and above the benefit to
    the possessor, which is the stimulating motive to the production of wealth,
    there is a benefit to the community, for no matter how selfish he may be,
    it is utterly impossible for any one to entirely keep to himself the benefit
    of any desirable thing he may possess. These diffused benefits when localized
    give value to land, and this may be taxed without in any wise diminishing
    the incentive to production.</p>
  <p>To illustrate: A man builds a fine house or large factory in a poorly improved
    neighborhood. To tax this building and its adjuncts is to make him pay for
    his enterprise and expenditure &#8212; to take from him part of his natural
    reward. But the improvement thus made has given new beauty or life to the
    neighborhood, making it a more desirable place than before for the erection
    of other houses or factories, and additional value is given to land all about.
    Now to tax improvements is not only to deprive of his proper reward the man
    who has made the improvement, but it is to deter others from making similar
    improvements. But, instead of taxing improvements, to tax these land values
    is to leave the natural inducement to further improvement in full force,
    and at the same time to keep down an obstacle to further improvement, which,
    under the present system, improvement itself tends to raise. For the advance
    of land values which follows improvement, and even the expectation of improvement,
    makes further improvement more costly.</p>
  <p>See how unjust and short-sighted is this system. Here is a man who, gathering
    what little capital he can, and taking his family, starts West to find a
    place where he can make himself a home. He must travel long distances; for,
    though he will pass plenty of land nobody is using, it is held at prices
    too high for him. Finally he will go no further, and selects a place where,
    since the creation of the world, the soil, so far as we know, has never felt
    a plowshare. But here, too, in nine cases out of ten, he will find the speculator
    has been ahead of him, for the speculator moves quicker, and has superior
    means of information to the emigrant. Before he can put this land to the
    use for which nature intended it, and to which it is for the general good
    that it should be put, he must make terms with some man who in all probability
    never saw the land, and never dreamed of using it, and who, it may be, resides
    in some city, thousands of miles away. In order to get permission to use
    this land, he must give up a large part of the little capital which is seed-wheat
    to him, and perhaps in addition mortgage his future labor for years. Still
    he goes to work: he works himself, and his wife works, and his children work &#8212; work
    like horses, and live in the hardest and dreariest manner. Such a man deserves
    encouragement, not discouragement; but on him taxation falls with peculiar
    severity. Almost everything that he has to buy &#8212; groceries, clothing,
    tools &#8212; is largely raised in price by a system of tariff taxation which
    cannot add to the price of the grain or hogs or cattle that he has to sell.
    And when the assessor comes around he is taxed on the improvements he has
    made, although these improvements have added not only to the value of surrounding
    land, but even to the value of land in distant commercial centers. Not merely
    this, but, as a general rule, his land, irrespective of the improvements,
    will be assessed at a higher rate than unimproved land around it, on the
    ground that &quot;productive property&quot; ought to pay more than &quot;unproductive
    property&quot; &#8212; a principle just the reverse of the correct one, for
    the man who makes land productive adds to the general prosperity, while the
    man who keeps land unproductive stands in the way of the general prosperity,
    is but a dog-in-the-manger, who prevents others from using what he will not
    use himself.</p>
  <p>Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased value
    which they give to land? To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated
    railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. But this great
    public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots. The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads ought not to be
    taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. It is the increased land values which
    they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
  <p>So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
    all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most prosperous
    which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity
    for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax what we
    want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We should tax that which
    results from the general prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is
    the increase of population, the extension of cultivation, the manufacture
    of goods, the building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value of land &#8212; not
    the increase in the value of land that induces the increase of population
    and increase of wealth. It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now
    worth hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers,
    it was only worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people,
    and so much more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and
    the increase of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased.
    Increase of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
    And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
    does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
    it. It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
    lays it.</p>
  <p>Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion. The
    tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It does
    not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost ease
    and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth.</p>
  <p>&quot;There is,&quot; says M. de Laveleye, in concluding that work in which
    he shows that the first perceptions of mankind have everywhere recognized
    a most vital distinction between property in land and property which results
    from labor, &#8212; &quot;there is in human affairs one system which is the
    best; it is not that system which always exists, otherwise why should we
    desire to change it; but it is that system which should exist for the greatest
    good of humanity. God knows it, and wills it; man's duty it is to discover
    and establish it.&quot; ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the

<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">Significant
      Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
      10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
      IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon
      the production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>...Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts
      him to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
      and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
      and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
      And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
      and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
      labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
      this would commensurately increase.</p>
  <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
      or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
      of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
      one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
      would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
  <p>The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its death
      blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and millions of acres
      from which settlers are now shut out by high prices would be abandoned by their
      present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal terms. And this not merely
      on the frontiers, but within what are now considered well settled districts.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land cannot
            be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by all competent
            economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons untrained in economics.
            The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is that it cannot limit the supply
            of land. Landowners are presumably, before the tax is laid, charging all
            the rent they can get. There is nothing in a tax on the rental value of
            land to make tenants willing to pay more or to make land more difficult
            to hire. On the contrary, more land will be on the market, because of such
            a tax, rather than less, since the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding
            land out of use and unimproved for mere speculation. The competition of
            former vacant land speculators to get their land used will make land cheaper
            to rent rather than more expensive. And since only the net rent remaining
            after the tax is subtracted is capitalized into salable value, land will
            be very much cheaper to buy. H.G.B.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
      land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as agricultural
      land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep land from its
      most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for it than the use
      to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had
      attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
      would operate to force improvement. Whoever planted an orchard, or sowed a
      field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory, no matter how costly, would
      have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept so much land idle.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though
      his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with stock.</li>
    <li> The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the privilege
          of keeping other people off of it until he wanted to use it, as his
      neighbor who has a fine house upon his lot.</li>
    <li> It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon valuable
          land as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile of great
      warehouses filled with costly goods.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid before
      labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage his
      labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
    <li> the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much for
          a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
    <li> the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have to expend
          a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
    <li> And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in lieu
          of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and stock.
        <p><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional economists,
                  have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension of this point.
                  Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced that the greater
                  cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor man who is trying to
                  save enough from his earnings to buy a piece of land; for, it is said,
                  the higher taxes on the land after it is acquired, offset the lower
                  purchase price. What such objectors do not see is that even if the
                  lower price of land does no more than balance the higher tax on it,
                  (and this overlooks, for one thing, the discouragement to speculation
                  in land), the reduction or removal of other taxes is all clear gain.
                  It is easier to save in proportion as earnings and commodities are
                  relieved of taxation. It is easier to buy land, because its selling
                  price is lower, if the land is taxed. And although the land, after
                  its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can this tax be fully
                  paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the purchase price,
                  but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on buildings and
                  other improvements and in whatever other taxes are thus rendered unnecessary.

  </ul>
  <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
    would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with
    each other
      for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to the point
    of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for laborers,
    and
      wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the labor market
    would have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment of
    labor, a
      competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
      demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to
      bid against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade
      and increased
      profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
      upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented
      monopolization.</p>
  <p> With natural opportunities thus free to labor;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> with capital and improvements exempt from tax, and exchange released
      from restrictions, the spectacle of willing men unable to turn their labor
      into

    <li> the recurring paroxysms which paralyze industry would cease;</li>
    <li> every wheel of production would be set in motion;</li>

  <p><strong><em>f. The Single Tax Retains Rent for Common Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>To retain Rent for common use it is not necessary to abolish land-titles,
    nor to let land out to the highest bidder, nor to invent some new mechanism
    of taxation, nor in any other way to directly change existing modes of holding
    land for use, or existing machinery for collecting public revenues. &quot;Great
    changes can be best brought about under old forms.&quot;109 Let land be held

    as now. But abolish all taxes except those that fall upon actual and potential
    Rent, that is to say, upon land values.</p>
  <p>If that were done it is doubtful if land-owners could any longer confiscate
      enough Rent to be worth the trouble. <strong>Even though some surplus were

      it than by confiscating Rent to private use, to say nothing of its being
      so much more respectable, that speculation in land values would practically

    for Taxing Land</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
<small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
<small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>What makes it impossible to tax everything at the same rate is
that one
of the things that would need to be taxed is leisure.&nbsp; Taxing
authorities have not yet devised ways to maintain people&#8217;s tax
obligations when they decide to earn and spend less money.&nbsp; Thus
all systems that tax people according to what they receive (from
working or saving), or spend, generate excess burdens.&nbsp; They do
this by making the incentive to work less than the value of what people
produce and the incentive to save less than the productivity of
investments financed by saving.&nbsp; Still, systems of &#8216;broad-based&#8217;
taxes (e.g., sales taxes, income taxes and value added taxes) generally
have lower excess burdens than tax systems in which a variety of
individual goods and services are taxed at different rates.&nbsp;
Actual broad-based taxes generally have exceptions and
non-uniformities, and these generally increase the excess burdens that
the taxes cause.&nbsp; Still, one way in which a departure from
uniformity in taxation can promote efficiency is that, if there are
some goods and services that are particularly likely to be purchased in
greater quantity when people consume more leisure, then a somewhat
higher tax on these can serve as a partial substitute for taxing
leisure.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In addition to discouraging work, most tax systems discourage
saving by
taxing the proceeds of people&#8217;s savings.&nbsp; This results in less
saving and investment.&nbsp; With the passage of time, this can cause a
very large reduction in the amount of capital in an economy.&nbsp; And
a reduced stock of capital generally means that labor will be less
productive and wages will be lower.&nbsp; A tax system that taxed only
consumption and not saving would not have this com&shy;ponent of excess
burden. However, raising a given amount of revenue in a tax system that
did not tax saving would require a greater distor&shy;tion of the
labor/leisure decision than in a tax system that did tax saving.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>...The supply of land is said to be perfectly
inelastic, vertical.&nbsp; Thus when a tax introduces a wedge between
the price paid by buyers of land services and the price received by
seller, the quantity remains unchanged.&nbsp; The triangle
disappears.&nbsp; Thus there is no excess burden of a tax on
land.&nbsp; A tax on land is &#8216;neutral&#8217;.</small><br>
<br>
<small>There are several limitations of this analysis.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, the tax
must not be more than the rental value of land, or no one will be
willing to hold title to land and pay the tax.&nbsp; Since the most
productive uses of land often require capital that is durable and
immobile, it is also necessary for people to be confident when they
contemplate investment that the tax will not exceed the rental value of
the land over the life of the investment.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, the tax must be administered in such a way that
the tax will
not increase if the land is used more productively.&nbsp; That would
discourage productive use of the land. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Finally, the analysis as
presented applies only to the indestructible components of land.&nbsp;
If there are ways that people might want to use land that would reduce
its value compared to what nature provided (as with mining or fishing),
then a tax on land in proportion to its value will give people an
inefficient incentive to reduce its value.
  </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a way to eliminate this
inefficient incentive.&nbsp; One can
apply to mineable land a &#8216;severance tax&#8217; for reductions in value.&nbsp;
To exactly offset the incentive effects of a land value tax, the amount
of the severance tax should be the present value of the reductions in
the land value tax that occur because of the reduction in the value of
the
land.&nbsp; Then the present value of the sum of the land value tax
payments and the severance tax payments will be indepen&shy;dent of how
the land is used</small><br>
<br>
<small>To summarize: If land is subject to a tax or combination of
taxes with
a present value that is independent of how the land is used, and if
potential investors are confident that the magnitude of the tax will
not exceed the value of using the land over the life of potential
invest&shy;ments, then a tax on land has no excess burden; it is
neutral. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Because increases in land value generally cause reductions in
both the
value of location-specific human capital and the value of pre-existing
structures, an efficient system of incen&shy;tives for activities that
increase land values would offer incentives reflecting only the net
benefits, after the value of the negative consequences for physical and
human capital had been subtracted from the increase in land
values.&nbsp; An ideal system would collect all of the extra increase
in land value and use it to provide compensation for the negative
consequences for physical and human capital.&nbsp; <a

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax
Policy to Promote Urban Growth</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes.
In a
market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
four factors of production: </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>the rent of land, </small></li>
  <li><small>the wages of labor, </small></li>
  <li><small>the interest received from owning capital, and </small></li>
  <li><small>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
investments and organizing production). </small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy
must
either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</small></p>
<p><small>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does
so at
the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
market forces.</small></p>
<p><small>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
have the option of moving away. </small></p>
<p><small>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the
rent
of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
for the costs that their actions impose on others.</small></p>
<p><small>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for
revenue
to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
collected publicly without discouraging growth.</small></p>
<p><small>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<small><strong>...</strong> Every activity that is
continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
</small>
<p><small>Thus the rental value of land is a natural first source of
financing for local public expenditures.</small></p>
<p><small>Making the rental value of land a principal source of local
public
revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.

</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of the rental value
of land is the gift of nature</span>--the fertility
of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second part of the
rental value of land comes from the provision
of public services.</span> The local agencies that provide these
services
can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
results from their activities.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A third part of the
rental value of any particular site arises
from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
site. </span>Social collection of this part of the rental value of
land is
particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
private activities according to how much they increase the rental
value of land.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of
land
has two parts. </small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> First, the rental value
of land has the rare quality of being a source of public revenue that
does not discourage productive activity. </span>If people are taxed
according to their labor earnings, they can be expected to work less,
and to tend to move from the places that tax them. If people are taxed
on their investments and savings, they can be expected to save and
invest less, and to find it attractive to put their savings and
investments in other places where they will not be taxed as much. But
when the rental value of land is collected, no one will reduce the
amount of land in existence, and no one will move his land elsewhere.
Thus social collection of the rent of land does not reduce the
productivity of an economy in the way that most other sources of public
revenue do.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second part of the
efficiency argument is that social collection of the rent of land tends
to make land more available to those who want to start new enterprises</span>.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
not collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to
ignore the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better
use of it. </span>On the other hand, if those who have rights to land
are required to make annual payments equal to the market value of the
rights they hold, then these continuing payments will induce people to
ask themselves regularly whether they ought to release the land to
someone who can make better use of it.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>To achieve the potential efficiency of public revenue from
land,
it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
their neighbors are being charged.</small></p>
<p><small>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
passing out titles to the current users of land. </small></p>
<p><small>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
land.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>The
efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</small></p>
<blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
  <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
value of surrounding land.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
<p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
<p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
features. 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
this feature. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
development. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
its land.</small><a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html"><big><small><small><span

<p>Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
  Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements.<br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Owners paying higher land dues feel pressured
to develop their land in order to pay their dues, and development is
already blighting many suburbs and farmland. Won't the PTS force
premature or excessive development, losing open space and ecologically
sensitive areas? Environmentalists should understand that development
is actually needed to spare land. Using some land more intensely means
using other land not at all. The PTS stimulates construction in the
most intensely-used locations; compact urban form leaves more
surrounding countryside pristine. Since about one-fifth of urban areas
are vacant or underused land, and half is devoted to cars, there's
plenty of room in cities for growth. While suburban commercial centers
compete with downtown for redevelopment, each new building, whether for
business or residents, must find tenants.<br>
<br>
Higher density is the expected result of the PTS, yet many people
oppose higher density. However, the noxious component is not a higher
density of population but of automobiles, creating congestion, noise,
noxious smells, and danger. The PTS, by clearing out the infestation of
vehicles, makes human habitats more livable and the added people
unnoticeable.<br>
<br>
Without coercion or remote planning, the PTS improves our settlement
patterns. Regulations and zoning, some assume, might be vitiated or
obviated, become obsolete. Instead, the PTS makes it easier for
regulations and zoning to do their job. Since the land tax lowers land
price, buying land for parks and reserves is more easily afforded. The
loss in revenue from removing the newly public lands from the tax rolls
would be offset somewhat by the corresponding rise in value of sites
near the protected open space. Creating green spaces raises the density
of already developed land, and thus its value. Furthermore, land dues
reduce the profit from land development, making it a less attractive
investment, and land use decisions of less economic consequence. After
a while, people with deep pockets would turn to investments that,
post-shift, would be untaxed. Reserving land for recreational or
natural uses becomes less contentious; people could more easily
determine an optimum proportion of green space to developed space.<br>
<br>
Redirecting land rent from owner to government might merely pass the
motive to exploit from owner to state, possibly the next implacable
force against conservation. However, while an individual must use their
own land most intensely to maximize profit, a government must optimize
land use to maximize its land tax base. That is, land value thruout the
jurisdiction is lower when there is border-to-border development;
overall values are higher when some space is kept open. From the
government's point of view, there's more rent to be collected when
highest and best use includes nonuse.<br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Like the rest of the universe, US
cities keep expanding. Some time before the
universe begins to contract, American metro
regions may, too. What counterpart to gravity might suck
suburbia back into the hole of our doughnut cities? One of the most
fundamental forces in the world - money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small> Without spending a penny of subsidy,
cities can make
urban renewal more profitable than
suburban
development. How is about as
commonsensical as
Einsteinian physics, but like "e=mc2",
it works. The trick
is to forget subsidies and lower one
tax while raising
another. That is, levy a tax or charge
a fee to collect
land value while eliminating any tax
on buildings or
improvements.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> The present property tax works
backwards, like an
intruder from the anti-universe. It
increases as owners
improve their property; it decreases
when owners let
buildings dilapidate. "Save money,
create slums," cities
tell owners.
</small></div>
&nbsp;
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Some owners do keep prime sites
covered with parking
lots or abandoned buildings while
waiting for land
values to rise. "Good numbers are hard
to come by,"
notes <a href="../auth/Batt.html">Bill Batt</a>, former fiscal policy
researcher for the
New York legislature, "but easily a
quarter of a US city
is under-utilized." Thus
urban cores decay, an
entropy that seems
natural and inevitable yet
is policy-induced.
</small></div>
<small>&nbsp;
<br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If the property tax is a
centrifugal force that
flings structures
outward, its opposite is
a land levy, a centripetal
force that pulls development inward.
To pay this
charge, owners try to put their
parcels to better use.
"Owners of the most valuable sites,
paying the most,
try hardest," explains Tom Gihring, a
Seattle-based
consultant.. "Since the most valuable
lots lie about the
center, it is the center which draws development." In-fill
happens.&nbsp;

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Planning_Mkts.html">Planning by
Markets</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Since we do
not collectively build homes and businesses -- homeowners and
business owners do that --we ought not tax them. We do generate the
value of land, higher where density is higher. Nobody by himself made
density; we all do that. Via our agent, a local government, we could
collect public rent for public betterment. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Planners have a litany of great
ideas for rebuilding cities<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(4)</i></b></small></font>
-- set-backs, landscaping,
pedestrian bridges, bridges, etc -- but have no idea of how to pay
for them. One way is to let them pay for themselves. Improving a city
raises its land's value. A tax or fee can collect this ground rent
that can then be used to pay off the earlier investment in
ecologizing the city<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(5)</i></b></small></font>.
Indeed, the expected change in land value can be a perfect measure of
some proposed improvement's worthiness. If it can pay its way, throw
it up. If it can't, then back to the drawing board.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No longer inhibited by the
property tax
yet spurred by annual land dues (tax or fee), owners and developers
get busy. Some Australian
towns that tax land alone average 50 percent more built value per
acre than those that don't. Since a mix of apartments, stores, offices,
schools, theaters, etc. maximizes site value and the return to
builders, they could find themselves pulling on the same end of the
rope with planners.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Where planners, armed with the
sternest growth control measures,
have failed, geonomics can succeed. By making speculation too
expensive, it unplugs the "metro tub", letting the flow of
development return to its natural course, filling in the vacant lots
and abandoned buildings. Clever local governments,
no longer able to tax willy-nilly and thus more dependent upon site
rent, would squeeze streets, now overly wide for traffic, replacing
parking lanes with space for sidewalk cafes beneath rows of shady
trees, alongside lanes for bikes, and thereby drive up site values.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>...&nbsp;</strong> How long would it take
to ecologize cities after shifting its
property tax? While Johannesburg (South African) levied a rate of
only 3 percent on site value, it enjoyed the fastest site-recycling
rate in the world, a little over 20 years. Within a couple decades,
we could have those cities we'd love.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As cities grow more livable and
lovable, their site values rise.
The resultant increase in land dues would push owners to continually
convert to highest and best use automatically. In this positive
feedback loop, cities would constantly renew.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While generals and anarchists
might not easily find common cause,
planners and markets can, when planners paddle with, not against, the
mighty current of rent. Correcting the market, so that taxes and
rents no longer interfere with the choices of owners and developers,
would attain highest and best use of sites automatically.</small> <small>&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Smith_Planning_Mkts.html"><big><big><small><small><span

<blockquote>
  <p><small><small>One must begin a
      discussion by recognizing that governments,
      constitutionally speaking, have two means by which to effectuate public
      policy, conventionally known as tax powers and police powers.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1 </span></small>The
      primary purpose of taxing power historically has been to raise the
      necessary revenue to support government functions as defined by the
      electorate through its chosen representatives. Many students of
      government argue that this should be its only purpose. President
      Reagan, for example, reflected this view of taxation when he stated in
      1981 that "the taxing power of the government must be used to provide
      for legitimate government purposes. It must not be used to regulate the
      economy or bring about social change."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> This
      view has within it the implicit view that there is a way to tax that is
      totally neutral in its influence on economic behavior, something which
      has not always been understood or agreed to. Taxes have always been
      used to facilitate socioeconomic policies, and in recent years have
      become a conscious tool of policy makers even more. One recent study
      notes that in the state of Washington, for example, 222 of the 378
      identifiable tax breaks for special purposes have been enacted since
      1970; the state of Oregon, similarly, has witnessed 288.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> But
      whether using taxing powers to facilitate other purposes is a wise and
      efficient approach needs to be more carefully considered, and there has
      been too little discussion of this issue in contemporary scholarship or
      political life. Furthermore, only recently has it been possible to
    understand the possibility of tax neutrality. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
  <p><strong>    <small> ...</small></strong><small> Not all revenue collection on the part
          of government is grounded in
        the
        constitutional authority of its tax powers. Taxes in the strictest
        sense of the term are revenues involuntarily paid to general funds for
        the general purposes of government. But there are many other revenues
        paid to government that would never be construed as taxes: lottery
        revenues, fines, interest payments, environmental (green) fees, payment
        for information, and user fees being the most common examples. Fines,
        green fees, and user fees are instruments of police power precisely
        because their primary purpose is to correct behavior, and only
        secondarily to raise revenue. User fees, along with environmental fees
        particularly, are employed to recover the costs of use, wear or damage
        to environmental or government-provided "services." (Only in recent
        years has it been fashionable to regard use or degradation of the
        natural environment as a "service," necessitating "correction," as was
        originally explicated by Pigou earlier this century.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
        <br>
        <small>Fiscal measures such as those noted above can be employed under
        police
        powers to correct, or at least compensate for, otherwise egregious
        social behavior, and public policy makers must concern themselves with
        the question whether such measures are more or less appropriate or
        effective. These provide an attractive alternative to what have come to
        be known as "command and control" approaches. Just as are so many
        fiscal measures, command-and-control approaches to regulating and
        controlling social and economic behavior is also grounded in the police
        powers of government. Administrative theory has grown in appreciation
        for fiscal approaches and away from command-and-control approaches in
        recent years.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">8</span></small> This
        is because they are often far less expensive and more efficient to implement,
        easier to understand, have a greater degree of compliance,
        and has the added virtue, lastly, of raising revenue for the support of
        governmental responsibilities. This interest in "tax shifting" has
        inspired the slogan, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tax

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... To secure the fullest
results of collecting land rent, structures
should be removed entirely from revenue base and imposed on the land
component alone. Phasing out the tax burden on improvements and placing
it on land value alone removes the penalty now placed on those who do
invest in and maintain their buildings. And, as mentioned earlier, it
prompts titleholders to abjure practices for speculative gain. If only
the land value component of the property tax is collected and tax on
buildings is eliminated, those who do use landsites to the full extent
that their value warrants are rewarded for doing so. ...</small><br>

<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting Distortions by
Pricing:
Increasing the Collection of Land Rent</span></small><br>
<small>Recovering the economic rent from urban parcels helps people to
appreciate the true costs of the transportation versus location
trade-off. It brings the carrying costs of site choices back to the
present time and makes them comparable with travel choices. The payment
of site rent becomes an operating cost. The other corrective policy
needed is to raise transportation costs to a level commensurate with
their full value as private goods. Transportation user fees, in the
form of motor fuel taxes, green taxes, congestion fees, and
administrative costs (for the administration of drivers' licenses and
registration fees) could easily provide the needed price corrections to
bring into balance marginal transportation costs and land rent
collection. Doing so would equilibrate choices between people living
and working in high rent urban centers and those in peripheral low rent
(but higher travel cost) locales.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Figure 2 shows how a tax on land value (or alternatively the tax
on
land rent) coupled with the proper design of transportation fees can
equilibrate the competitive advantage of markets in urban areas
relative to suburbs, thereby reducing, and perhaps even reversing, the
centrifugal forces of sprawl development. The land tax cannot alone
redress the problem, especially so long as such inordinate social
subsidies are granted to private motor vehicle transportation services.
Nor can transportation fees, raised to a level fully commensurate with
the social and private costs they incur, alone ensure that the price of
locations will be matched. But to the extent that both are assessed,
they reach far toward correcting this disequilibrium. One could even
argue that all site rent should be recaptured by society and that all
transportation costs that are identifiable as consumption of private
goods should be priced accordingly. Some advocates even suggest that
doing so will not only foster economic efficient behavior but also
provide sufficient revenue for a citizen's dividend consistent with
economic justice.... <a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html"><span

    is roughly a third of a nation&#8217;s GDP.29 The question is whether it
    makes more sense to. Should we elect to continue property tax regimes as
    we do, it would make better sense to tax buildings as stocks and lands as
    rent flows. But this raises the question whether real property should be
    exempt from all taxes, as some have argued.30 What rationale exists for taxing
    lands, whether as stocks or flows; and why do we tax buildings? I will argue
    below that taxing buildings and the failure to adequately tax land both have
    deleterious consequences for the whole economy.</p>
  <p><strong>Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements
      of any sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained
      largely
    as a matter of historical inertia.</strong> Only in the recent century or two have
    buildings represented any significant capital value; prior to the rise of
    major cities, the value of real property lay essentially in land. American
    cities today typically record aggregate assessed land values &#8211; at least
    when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of total taxable
    value, that is, of land and buildings taken together.31 Skyscrapers reflect
    enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted because of
    the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets its market price from
    the fact that the total neighborhood context creates an attractive market
    presence and ambience. By taxing buildings, however, we impose a penalty
    on their optimum development as well as on the incentives for their maintenance.
    Moreover, <strong>taxes on buildings take away from whatever burden would
    otherwise be imposed on sites, with the result that incentives for their
    highest and
    best use is weakened. </strong>Lastly, the technical and administrative challenges
    of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting, particularly
    since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes, evaluated
    for potential replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated with
    administration of property taxation and appeal litigation involve disputes
    over the valuation of structures, not land values. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Failure to recapture
publicly-created land rents through the
tax mechanism provided the incentive to speculators to buy land, not
to use it in production but to hold it for the rise. In this way,
choice parcels remain undeveloped or underdeveloped relative to the
full extent that their values warrant and development occurs instead
in remote areas where opportunity for profit is more immediate. The
result was low density development what we know as sprawl.</small></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems to me that there are better ways than eminent domain to provide
    the incentives that will lead the private sector to develop choice land. <strong>... </strong></p>
  <p>While at one time this area might have been an appropriate place for a neighborhood
    of single family homes, it appeared to me that that time had passed a decade
    or so ago. It seemed to me that the path of progress would -- if the incentives
    were logical and the market responsive to signals -- have caused the private
    sector to have redeveloped that site. Such re-development might have been
    painful to the residents of the neighborhood, but would have put now-choice
    land to a higher and better use than single-family homes.<br>
        <br>
    But our system wasn't designed to send signals all that well -- Connecticut
    law required properties to be reassessed once every decade (and I've heard
    that once in early '70s and once in the late 80's was construed to satisfy
    that requirement). Now assessments are required every 4 years (though my
    town decided it didn't like the 2003 revaluation and is keeping the 1999
    for a few more years).<br>
      <br>
    But if the properties had been reassessed on a regular basis, with market-based
    values assigned first to the land and the residual being assigned to the
    existing buildings, the homeowners themselves would have been in a position
    to make their own rational decisions on whether it was worth it to them to
    continue to occupy extremely valuable land (and pay the taxes on it), or
    more to their advantage to accept an offer from someone who was prepared
    to put it to a higher and better use, and take that equity and buy elsewhere.<strong> ... </strong></p>
  <p>Our land, particularly the best-located land, is a common asset on which
    we are all dependent. Allowing individuals or corporations to occupy it without
    compensating the rest of us for its value is the underlying problem, and
    solving that problem through good assessment and rational (that is, land
    value) taxes is the way to solve it. When we do that, a lot of problems will
    begin to fall away.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Achenbaum_EmDo.html"><strong>Read

  </div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>The case for site value rating in terms of economic efficiency is founded
        on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by human effort
        is one of the few sources of government revenue that does not reduce incentives
        for people to be productive. Two other revenue sources that have this virtue
        are taxes on other government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of
        radio frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
        as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue sources
        that do not diminish productivity are employed to the greatest possible extent
        before any use is made of taxes that impede productivity.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">What makes a tax efficient is that the amount of tax that is
      due cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
      taxed, people
      can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less. They do so, and the
      productivity of the economy falls. When houses are taxed, people can reduce
      the amount of taxes owed by building fewer house and smaller houses. They
      do so, and the housing shortage worsens. But when the unimproved value of
      land is taxed, there is no resulting diminution in the quantity of land.
      Thus taxes can be levied on land without diminishing the productivity of
      an economy. And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will
      improve the productivity of an economy. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">read the whole article</a></div>

      <p>Land value taxation generalizes into the principle that people should pay
            for all of their appropriations of natural opportunities, according to
        the opportunity costs of those appropriations, and the resulting revenue
        should
    be shared equally. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">
      <p>Taxing land has an additional effect that increases the stock of capital.
          A tax on land represents a redistribution from living adults to the young
          and unborn, who will now be born with rights to land. Unless there is a perfectly
          offsetting reduction in the desire to accumulate assets to transfer to the
          next generation, this redistribution will induce the living, who now have
          fewer assets, to accumulate at a more rapid rate than they would otherwise
        do. That is, saving and capital accumulation will increase.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">Taxing land also increases the efficiency with which land is used. This
        occurs through three paths.</div>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>First, a tax on land reduces the return to land speculation, and therefore
                            reduces the quantity of land speculation. </li>
    <li> Second, as taxes on land are capitalized into the selling price of land,
                                the result is the substitution of a recurring
      cost (the annual tax) for a one-time cost (the purchase price). This makes
      land
          relatively more attractive
                                to bidders with high discount rates and relatively
          less attractive to bidders with low discount rates. To the extent that
      the former are more entrepreneurial
                                and the latter more passive investors, land will
      tend to flow into the hands of persons who will choose to use it more intensively. </li>
    <li> The third path by which a tax on land increases the efficiency with
      which land is used is that, for those who are using land
          inefficiently, it substitutes an explicit cost (the tax) for an implicit
          one (the income foregone by
        inefficient use). </li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left">Psychologically, explicit costs tend to be more
      effective in motivating efficient behavior than implicit ones. .. <a href="docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">read
