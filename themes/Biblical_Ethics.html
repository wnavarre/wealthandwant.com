<p>  Henry George: <a

  Apostle of Freedom</a>&nbsp; (1878 speech)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Moses saw that the real cause of
the enslavement of the masses of
Egypt was &#8211; what has everywhere produced enslavement &#8211; the
possession by a class of land upon which and from which the whole
people must live. He saw that to permit in land the same unqualified
private ownership that by natural right attaches to the things
produced by labour, would be inevitably to separate the people into
the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave labour &#8211;
to make the few the masters of the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation no matter what the religion.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates not
for the need of a day, but for all the future, he sought, in ways
suited to his times and conditions, to guard against this error.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Everywhere in the Mosaic
institutions is the land treated as the gift of the Creator to His
common creatures, which no one has the right to monopolise. </span>Everywhere
it is, not your estate, or your property, not the land which you
bought, or the land which you conquered, but "the land which the Lord
thy God giveth thee" &#8211; "the land which the Lord lendeth thee". And by
practical legislation, by regulations to which he gave the highest
sanctions, he tried to guard against the wrong that converted ancient
civilisations into despotisms &#8211; the wrong that in after centuries ate
out the heart of Rome, that produced the imbruting serfdom of Poland
and the gaunt misery of Ireland, the wrong that is today filling
American cities with idle men, and our virgin states with tramps.</small><br>
<br>
<small>He not only provided for a redistribution of the land among the people, and for making it fallow and common every seventh year,
but by the institution of the Jubilee he provided for a redistribution
of the land every fifty years, and made monopoly impossible.</small><br>
<br>
<small>I do not say that these institutions were, for their ultimate
purpose, the best that might even then have been devised; but Moses had
to work, as all great constructive statesmen have to work, with the
tools that came to his hand, and upon materials as he found them. Still
less do I mean to say that forms suitable for that time and people are
suitable for every time and people.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> I
ask, not veneration of the form, but recognition of the spirit.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet how common it is to
venerate the form and to deny the spirit. </span>There are many who
believe that the Mosaic institutions were literally dictated by the
Almighty, yet who would denounce as irreligious any application of
their spirit to the present day. And yet today how much we owe to these
institutions! <span style="font-weight: bold;">This very day the only

and Justice</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We were talking about the tendency for landowners to use land as an investment &#8212; a
    sensible thing to do &#8212; not to use it now if they don't need to, but to
    think in terms of enjoying its increase in value over time. We even identified
    that as the key to the problem of poverty. But &#8212; good heavens, what
    can we do about that? Isn't that just how the economy works? Isn't the private
    ownership of land a basic part of a modern economy? How can we do without
    such
  an important institution?</p>
  <p> Or in other words &#8212; won't the poor always be with us?</p>
  <p> Not necessarily. It has been plain, since very earliest days of civil society,
    that the private ownership of land leads to exploitation and great extremes
    of wealth and poverty. And, since the time of the Book of Leviticus, we have
    had a pretty good idea of what to do about it. In that book were recorded
    the words &quot;The land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is Mine,
    for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.&quot;</p>
  <p> This ideal was codified into a remarkable three-stage program for economic
    justice and social harmony: the land laws of Leviticus. The stages were:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <strong>1. The Sabbath.</strong> Every seventh day was the Lord's day;
        people were enjoined to keep it holy and refrain from work. Now, we were
        told in Sunday school that this was all about going to church, but, as so
        often happens, our teachers missed the deeper significance. Kids who try
        to get out of, say, taking out the garbage on the Sabbath realized that the
        prohibition was really against gainful work; folks were still allowed to
        weed the garden and stuff. <br>
      What the Sabbath did was to force people to focus on things that had
        meaning beyond striving and striving to get ahead. Indeed, if one did
        work on the
        Sabbath, while one's neighbors did not, one could become wealthier, at
        their expense &#8212; which was why the Sabbath was a very big deal:
        one of the ten commandments.<br>
      <strong>2. The Sabbatical.</strong> Every seventh year, the fields
              were to lie fallow &#8212; thus recognizing the right of the earth
              itself to be protected against depletion and misuse. And, in the
              sabbatical year, debts were to be forgiven. A debt that could not
              be paid off
              after six years was well on the way to becoming a usurious burden,
              a guaranteed flow from the labors of one into the coffers of another.
              The canceling of debts in the seventh year was designed to ensure
              that nobody got too far ahead, or too far behind.<br>
      <strong>3. The Jubilee.</strong> Even seven times seven years (actually,
              every 50th year), each family could return to its original allotment,
              or heritage, of land &#8212; even if it had been sold in the meantime.
              Under biblical law, then, land could not be sold for ever &#8212; never
              for more than a single generation. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now it is interesting to note that the economic vision presented in the
    bible is not a precursor of communism. Two of the ten commandments explicitly
    support
    the institution of private property, and the prophets consistently railed
    against landlords and rulers who robbed the people of the fruits of their
    labor. The
    laws of Leviticus, which Jesus said he &quot;came not to destroy but to fulfill,&quot; envisioned
    a community in which everyone was secure in his own home and property, &quot;beneath
    his vine and fig tree&quot;. </p>
  <p> (Incidentally, the quote on the American Liberty Bell, from Leviticus,
    chapter 25, was a direct reference to these principles : &quot;Proclaim liberty throughout
    the land and to all the people thereof.&quot; It was a reference to the Jubilee,
    and the freedom it provided was from debt and servitude.)</p>
  <p> The division is clear: there is to be a sacred right of private property
    in the things that are made by people. But people were not to own the things
    that were made by God. The 7th commandment sums up both principles in 4 words: <em>Thou
    shalt not steal</em>.</p>
  <p> Modern society has looked away from these principles, calling them quaint,
    naive, inapplicable to the complexities of our time &#8212; yet, modern society
    finds itself mired in chronic economic and social problems for which it can
    find no solutions &#8212; and which threaten to pull down all the advances
    of civilization into a dark age &#8212; occasioned by some combination of
    war, financial implosion or ecological collapse. </p>
  <p> If there is any way out of this dark future, it can only come by way of solving
    the problem of land and justice. </p>
  <p> Fortunately, there exists a plan for that. </p>
  <p> This plan takes the shape of a &quot;fiscal reform&quot;, because it applies
    a definition of the relationship between the individual and the society that
    is consistent with both economic efficiency and moral law. It calls for us
    to respect the right of labor to create and to save wealth, and we acknowledge
    that the value of land is created not by its &#8220;owners&#8221;, but by
    the entire community. </p>
  <p>Therefore, we will abolish all taxes on income, products and sales &#8212; and
      collect the full rental value of land and other natural resources for public
      revenue. ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

<p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington and
    the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
    argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity, and
    are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained them
    from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and natural
    resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every one of the
    N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal beds, 1/Nth of
    the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile soil. God wills
    a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own vine and his own
    fig tree.</p>
  <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of
    land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
    of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
    Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the
    use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty
    years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary
    owner.</p>
  <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
    of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
    expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
    owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
    a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here I
    am anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
    in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
  <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
    of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements on it,
    practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not the original
    sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose to hold his &quot;fair
    share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay a land tax about equal to
    his dividend check, and so would break even. By 1/Nth of the land is meant
    land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the value of all the land in the country.</p>
  <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
    as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to hold
    more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would prefer
    to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check representing
    the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
  <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
    at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough to
    feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and 1/Nth
    of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population. A family
    of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend checks will
    enable them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied to that
    land is enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of course, they
    may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably, but the situation
    from which we start is one in which everyone has his own plot of ground from
    which to wrest a living by the strength of his own back, and any deviation
    from this is the result of voluntary exchanges agreed to by the parties directly
    involved, who judge themselves to be better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
  <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is extremely
    conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic ideas about
    land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles or gold
    or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking countries
    uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal property
    (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite
    of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
    means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the people.
    Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
    term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that the
    landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
    for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to property
    other than land, although complications arise when there are buildings on
    the land that is being seized.</p>
  <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
    support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
    Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
    Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
    F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized by
    Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and the
    Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight of the
    Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of the proposals
    of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>,
    1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco Modigliani, 1985;
    James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
    S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
  <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
    cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
    tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is about
    to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value of the land
    and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure you that real estate
    assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice to make the two assessments
    separately, and a parcel of land in the business district of a large city
    very often has a different owner from the building on it.) Many cities have
    moved to a system of taxing land more heavily than improvements, and most
    have been pleased with the results, finding that landholders are more likely
    to use their land productively -- to their own benefit and that of the public
    -- if their taxes do not automatically go up when they improve their land
    by constructing or maintaining buildings on it.</p>
  <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
    proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental and
    reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results of
    a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the difference
    in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other proposals of
    the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me absolute dictator
    of the world so that I can supervise the distribution, and if it doesn't
    work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that absolute dictators seldom
    resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The concept of taxing land values for public finance is ancient. The Bible
    declares &#8220;the profit of the Earth is for all&#8221; (Ecclesiastes 5:9).
    Land rent financed government in England during the Middle Ages.9 During
    the 1700s, some French economists proposed an &#8220;<em>imp&ouml;t unique</em>&#8221; or
    single tax on land value. Calling their theory &#8220;physiocracy&#8221; (the
    rule of natural law), they outlined a model of economic development that
    used land value taxes to finance public works, which increased the value
    of the land (and thus increased taxes paid to the treasury), resulting in
    an upward spiral of development and prosperity. The principal physiocratic
    economist, Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay, wrote</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <em>Taxes ... should be laid directly on the net product of landed property</em>,
      and not on men&#8217;s wages, or on produce, where they would increase
      the cost of collection, operate to the detriment of trade, and destroy
      every year a portion of the nation&#8217;s wealth. [Emphasis in the original.]10</p>

      Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics 
    </a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As with all nineteenth century
moral philosophers, Henry George
subscribed to a belief in natural law. The natural order of things as
he saw it required that land be held in usufruct and that rent from
such should be returned to society. The theory was inspired by his
deeply religious roots and grounded in his reading of the prominent
thinkers that predated him. The natural order was also a moral order,
and the failure to comply with the order of nature and society as he
saw it was a perversion of justice. The fruits of the land belonged to
everyone, just as the fruits of one&#8217;s own labor were uniquely one&#8217;s
own. Since one owned one&#8217;s body, one was entitled to keep the product
of one&#8217;s physical efforts. Society had no more right to confiscate the
earnings of one&#8217;s sweat and brow than it ought to leave in the hands of
rich landowners the rent that was everyone&#8217;s inherent birthright to be
shared. There were just and unjust
taxes, and the only just tax was that which grew out of rent, of the
unearned increment that visited certain land sites as windfall gains
because of the efforts and investments by the community. Income and
excise taxes were unjust and confiscatory &#8212; even theft, as especially
were tariffs. Taxing or collecting land rent alone was the means of
ending poverty and restoring progress. Indeed many Georgists reject use
of the word tax entirely, preferring instead to talk instead about rent
collection. There is even a lapel button Georgists use that says
&#8220;Abolish all taxes; collect ground rent instead.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Georgist Economics:
Moral Premises</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>What distinguished Henry
George&#8217;s views from those of his
adversaries in the last decade of his life was his assertion that
economics was necessarily a moral science. Unlike those who became the
founders of the American Economics Association in 1885, most of whom
were transitional figures to what would become neoclassical economics,
the primary focus of George and his disciplines was economic justice.
This is not to say that explanation was cast aside; indeed the subtitle
of his magnum opus, <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></span>,
was <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">An Inquiry
into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with
Increase of Wealth . . . The Remedy</span>. Why, he asked, in the midst
of such boundless plenty is there such abject poverty? He would
dedicate his book, first published in 1879, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;to those who, seeing the vice and
misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and
privilege, feel the possibility of a higher social state and would
strive for its attainment.&#8221;</span> He had known poverty first hand when
he was struggling to support his young family and establish himself as
a printer, a journalist and a publisher. He could also see before him
the fruits of land and nature easily available to be harvested but for
its legal capture by monopoly titleholders. He wrote of all this in
some six books and countless other essays, the focus always on the
theme of economic justice.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Along with Robert Ingersoll, he was likely the most stimulating <a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/George/Speeches.html">orator
</a>of his age, a fiery moralist at a time during which there were many
others who might claim such a title. He traveled widely, was a champion
of labor, the landless, and the urban poor, particularly influential in
the struggle over the Irish land question and in the positions of the
Liberal party in the early 20th century. His admirers among the great
of the time were myriad: Sun Yat Sen, Leo Tolstoi, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
Churchill</a>,
Theodore Roosevelt, Charles Beard, <a href="../auth/Twain.html">Samuel Clemens</a>, Robert Maynard
Hutchins, and <a href="../HG/PP/Dewey_Appreciation_HG.html">John Dewey</a> to name a few. Forewarned in 1897 that running
for mayor of New York a second time and trying at the same time to
finish another authoritative statement of his philosophy would kill
him, the prophesy was fulfilled nonetheless with his death four days

matched against a scion of banking wealth Abram S. Hewitt, who was
recruited by Seth Low, President of Columbia University, but he beat
the third place finisher, Teddy Roosevelt. His funeral on the streets
of New York drew the largest crowd of mourners ever assembled until
that time, and until much later. No one doubted Henry George&#8217;s
passionate commitment to justice.</small></div>

      <small>The heart of George&#8217;s economics was, in a way, Biblical. As
      the son of
  a religious book publisher born in Philadelphia, he had adequate
  opportunity to witness the early growth of the American republic in a
  unique way. On his own in San Francisco and responsible for a wife and
  child at a young age, his first effort at resolving the puzzles of
  injustice were a manuscript printed in 1871. But only after additional
  exposure to Ricardian rent theory was he able to refine his ideas such
  that they could form the basis of his <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress
  and Poverty</a></span> eight years
  later. His Christian roots led him to a deep commitment to the basic
  moral equality of all people; his challenge was to find a way to ensure
  that this equality was manifest in economic fairness.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>As noted earlier, the starting point of Georgist philosophy is
  that
  nature belongs to owners only in usufruct and not in freehold. Because
  any monetary wealth that accrued to that nature stemmed directly from
  the physical presence of people and was therefore social in character,
  the resulting added increment of value that constituted rent belonged
  in turn to the community that created it. Nature would have no economic
  price without people. Hence rent was the community&#8217;s entitlement and
  not that of individuals, and the land rent that accrued to parcels as a
  result of social investment should be returned to &#8212; recaptured by &#8212; the
  community. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It was obvious to George
  that the wealthiest people in the nation usually owed their fortune not
  to the sweat of their brow or the inventiveness of their minds. Rather
  their position was due to their success as land speculators, to an
  increase in rent on land they had captured title to, land rightfully
  belonging to all. </span>The earth and all its product, he argued, was
  the common heritage of humanity, a birthright of all people.&nbsp; ... <a

    <p>I want to tell you the story of Charles Avilla. A while back I came across
      a book called <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ownership, Early Christian Teachings</span>.
      Avilla was a divinity student in the Phillipines. One of his professors
      had a great concern about poverty conditions in the Phillipines, and was
      taking students out to prisons where the cooks were the land rights revolutionaries
      in the Phillipines. Because they kept pushing for land reform for the people,
      they had ended up in jail. So they were political prisoners who were reading
      the Bible and were asking the question, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">who did God give this earth to? Who does it belong
      to?</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It isn't in the Bible
      that so few should have so much and so many have so little.</span> In the
      theological world in this upscale seminary he was trying to put this together
      about poverty and what the biblical teachings were. He had a thesis to
      write and he was thinking he would do something about economic justice.
      One of his professors thought there would be a wealth of information from
      the church's early history, the first 300 years after Jesus. So he actually
      went back to read the Latin and Greek about land ownership and found a
      wealth of information about the prophetic railings of the people in that
      early time on the rights of the land.<br>
    <br>
    Let me give you a few quotes from that early period.</p>

    <br>
    And Isaiah 5:8, "Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to

      The Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax Crusade</a> </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>A University of Alabama School of Law Professor has asked God's forgiveness
      for the years she lived in the sin of ignorance about tax injustice. Susan
      Pace Hamill, a tax expert, business consultant, and dedicated United Methodist
      church goer, thought there was a misprint when she first read that personal
      incomes as low as $4,600 for a family of four were being taxed by the state,
      while timber owners holding 71% of the land of Alabama were paying less than
      $1 per acre in property taxes. Two hours later she found out there had been
      no mistake and that Alabama has the most regressive tax code in the country.
      Her righteous rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated onto the national
      scene. ... <br>
    While resoundingly condemning the current system (she uses words like "horrific" and "monstrous
      injustice") Hamill clearly articulates a tax reform approach which shifts
      taxes off of low wage earners and onto large land owners. Through a combination
      of her own reasoning, caring heart, and inherent sense of justice and a thorough
      investigation of Judeo-Christian ethics, Hamill arrived at a tax policy approach
      which bears remarkable similarities to the economic justice crusades of 19th
      century reformer, Henry George.<br>
  <br>
  Her appeal is to the 93 percent of Alabama residents who call themselves Christians.
  Hamill challenges them to put their faith into practice. Her message fell on
  many already listening ears. The state's two largest denominations, United Methodists
  and Southern Baptists, had passed resolutions favoring tax reform in 2000. In
  2001 the state's Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Catholics approved similar
  calls. The Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama and the Business Council
  of Alabama had long clamored for tax change. In fact, tax reform is now supported
  by most of the state's religious organizations, according to Charles Durham,
  pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Tuscaloosa.<br>
  <br>
  What makes Hamill's work so compelling is her deep grasp of the Alabama tax code
  combined with her thorough documentation of the scriptural bases for economic
  justice. She quotes chapters and verses which proclaim that the poor should not
  be oppressed and that society should create conditions for their advance. Among
  her favorites are Jesus'
  words in Matthew 25:45: "Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these,
  you did not do for me." Luke 16:19-31 is a parable of a rich man sent to hell
  because of his indifference to the disadvantaged and
  in Jeremiah 22:15-16, "He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all
  went well."<br>
  <br>
  While Hamill suspected she would be opposed by special interest groups like the
  Alabama Farmers Federation which represents big timber and agribusiness interests,
  she was not prepared for the attacks and underhanded tactics of the Alabama Christian
  Coalition under the leadership of President John Giles. While Giles agrees that
  tax relief
  to the less fortunate "is a noble thing" he says the care of the poor is the
  duty of private charity not of government and staunchly opposes tax increases.
  He tried to damage the Hamill campaign by smearing her personal integrity, pointing
  to her signing of a pro-choice petition as evidence that she therefore could
  not be a moral authority on tax
  reform. Opposing forces also called her a "Yankee carpetbagger" detailing her
  work history at two New York law firms. They said (wrongly so) that her tax proposals
  would bring huge property increases
  on the average home and business.<br>
  <br>
  Bob Blalock, editorial page editor for The Birmingham News, says that
  the "real question about legitimacy should be aimed at the Christian Coalition.
  For whom does it speak when it attacks Hamill? Christians, many of whom would
  benefit from a fairer tax system, even one that raised more money? Or powerful
  special-interest groups (timber? agribusiness?) that want to protect their obscene
  tax breaks?" Blalock says there is no way to know because the law does not require
  the
  Christian Coalition to disclose what individuals or groups fund it. "When an
  organization places itself in the center of the debate over tax reform, citizens
  deserve to know who's funding its point of view." (3/14/03)<br>
  <br>
  Hamill's conservative theology school responded to the attacks by firmly backing
  her stance. Faculty at Beeson Divinity School of Samford University in Birmingham
  passed a unanimous resolution endorsing her
  efforts. "We think what she has proposed is worthy support from the Christian
  community and we think it is in keeping with the evangelical
  community," said the school's dean, Timothy George (Anniston Star,
  3/11/03).<br>
  <br>
  Frank Thielman, Presbyterian Professor of Divinity at Beeson had this to say
  about their resolution: "Personally, I hope it does encourage dramatic tax
  reform that helps to relieve the burden of the poor. The reason I'm hopeful
  is because
  of my commitment as a Christian and my Christian vision. That is a vision that
  the poor should be dealt with equitably and fairly and that is a very biblical
  vision. It's because of my Christian commitment and the Bible and the word
  of God that I
  hope tax reform efforts succeed." (Anniston Star, 3/11/03) ... <a href="docs/Hartzok_Hamill.html">read

  <p>Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html">The Political Economy of the Gospels</a></p>
  <p>The grand question of economic ethics, the question of whether capitalism
    or socialism is the more appropriate form of political economy, is another
    non-question from the perspective of the Gospels. Everyone who wants to live
    under socialism should be free to live under socialism, and everyone who
    wants to live under capitalism should be free to live under capitalism. In
whichever group we fall, we will want to insure that those who want to organize
    their lives by different principles of political economy have their share
    of land
and natural resources with which to do so.</p>
  <p>A political economy based on the Gospels is a political economy based on
    love. As the First Epistle of John says, "There is no fear in love; but perfect
    love casteth out fear."<font size="-1"><b><i>17</i></b></font> To construct
    a political economy of the Gospels we must be free of fear: free of fear
    that others may rob us; free of fear that others may not contribute to the
    provision of public goods or to provision for those who might otherwise lack;
    free of fear that our incomes will be too low or the prices we face too high;
    free of fear that if we don't do something, someone will be exploited. Only
    when love has replaced all fear in our hearts will we be able to construct
    the political economy of the Gospels.<a href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html">read the whole article</a></p>
