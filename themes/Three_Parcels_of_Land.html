Bill Batt: <a
 href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rent becomes critically
important in Georgist economics,
because rent is the increment of market gain that accrues to choice
land parcels. This insight arose originally in the context of
agricultural societies, where differential qualities of land were
recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone to
keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the
efforts of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a
higher yield separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment
might represent, this constituted a windfall gain above and beyond what
might be minimally expected. This is land rent, and it exists even if
it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as earlier noted, the greatest land rents
derive from their location, grown out of nearby social investment.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The concept of rent needs further explication precisely because
it is
so foreign to 20th century students, even those who have been schooled
in economics at it is currently taught. Land rent has no relationship
to the word rent as it is used in contemporary vernacular, that is,
when one rents a car or an apartment. Rather, rent is a surplus,
defined as the return on investment above and beyond what is minimally
required to bring a service into production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To take just an elementary example,
consider that there are three parcels of land available for farming and
three farmers of equal ability and enterprise.</span> But suppose the
parcels differ in their productive capacity, due perhaps to their
fertility, access to water, and so on. If planted with similar quality
seed, the three parcels will yield different quantities of harvest, the
one with the highest quality land having the best return. The one with
the lowest quality land would in like fashion have the&nbsp;lowest
return. Economic rent is defined as the amount of surplus harvest
qualitatively measured by the difference between the parcel with the
highest return and that with the lowest return.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Even though its originator, David Ricardo, had in mind the
differential
return from agricultural lands, the concept of rent applies to other
natural services as well. Consider what happens in the case of urban
communities, using the simplest comparison with a tic-tac-toe board.
When the lattice is completely undeveloped and consists only of vacant
land squares, the locational sites have inconsequential value. But let
us suppose that each square is then settled &#8212; the first by a hotel, the
second by a department store, the third by a restaurant and so on &#8212; and
supposing that the owner of the center square is reticent to build at
all. Reserving his prerogative as titleholder he may intend ultimately
to sell. Given the rules of economics as they apply today he may be
wise to do so, keeping his money for other uses, as his square will
have increased in market value more than all the others despite his
having done nothing to improve it. It was this that prompted John
Stuart Mill to observe that &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, aris[es] from the efforts of an entire community.. . .&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> As
will be discussed later below, the single greatest factor in
determining the economic rental value of land today results not from
nutrients or access to water but rather due to site value determined by
location. And that can be priced and collected easily.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Lastly, one must appreciate that the market value of &#8220;land&#8221; of
every
sort is entirely rent, as there is no human factor of labor that
accounts for its origination. Services of nature have no prior cost to
bring them into production existence &#8212; the electromagnetic spectrum,
for example, exists regardless of human presence on earth and so
presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy metals are
all found in nature, not the result of human creation. They are, in
19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor but of
God&#8217;s. And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative on earth &#8212;
the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as much as it was their
role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of the land. That
bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements, was an
equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of rent
collection and the exploitation of land without
recognition of its price. The practice effectively ended with what in
Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign,
driving the peasants off the land into cities to provide cheap labor
for the early English industrialists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But
the theory continued long afterwards. Georgists today argue that land
rent should be collected from titleholders so that it is not left to
render economic distortions. This in turn affects the price of labor
and the price of money. Government&#8217;s role, whatever else it does, is at
the very least responsible for defending the commons, to ascertain
titles and to collect rent. Although there are many differences about
the proper role, scope and domain of government among Georgist
adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
is central to its tenets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Despite assiduous efforts to make clear the extent and the
limits of
the economic rent as a concept &#8212; known as well as land rent, Ricardian
rent, and ground rent, even the best of contemporary neoclassical
economists disagree. Some texts argue that certain athletes or other
star performers with great natural ability reap returns for their
efforts far above what is in fact necessary to &#8220;bring them into
productive use.&#8221; The difference between what it would minimally take to
entice them to perform and the price they are actually paid is all
economic rent. Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears, and the
Beatles have all been compensated with impressive amounts of economic
rent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">29</span></small>
Georgists and classical economists are of mixed minds, arguing
sometimes that such payments are either wages or else are simply
transfers that in no way reflect productivity.<small><span
