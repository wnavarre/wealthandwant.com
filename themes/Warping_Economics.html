Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">Neo-classical
Economics as a Stratagem Against Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
Neoclassical economics is the idiom of most economic discourse
today. It is the paradigm that bends the twigs of young minds and
confines the florescence of older ones, like mesh wire around a
topiary. It took form a century ago, when Henry George and his reform
proposals were a clear and present political danger and challenge to
the landed and intellectual establishments of the world. Few people
realize to what a degree the founders of Neoclassical economics
changed the discipline for the express purpose of deflecting George,
discomfiting his followers, and frustrating future students seeking
to follow his arguments. The stratagem was semantic: to destroy the
very words in which he expressed himself. Simon Patten expounded it
succinctly. "Nothing pleases a ...
single taxer better than ... to use the well-known economic theories
... [therefore] economic doctrine must be recast" (Patten
1908, p.219; Collier, 1979, p.270).<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1 ...</span></small></small><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Having taken shape in the
1880-1890s, <b>Neo-Classical Economics
(henceforth NCE)</b> remained remarkably static. Major texts by
Marshall, Seligman, and Richard T. Ely, written in the 1890s, went
through many reprintings each over a period of 40 years with few if
any changes. "It was for the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle (1884) that I wrote the first edition of my <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Outlines</span>, under
the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Introduction to Political
Economy</span>. In this first edition of
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Outlines </span>there is to be
found the general philosophy and
principles that have shaped all future editions, including that of
1937" (Ely, 1938, p.81).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not until 1936 was there another
major "revolution," and that was
hived off into a separate compartment, macro-economics, and contained
there so as not to disturb basic tenets of NCE. Compartmentalization,
we will see in several instances, is the common NCE defense against
discordant data and reasoning.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To most modern readers, probably
George seems too minor a figure
to have warranted such an extreme reaction. This impression is a
measure of the neo-classicals' success: it is what they sought to
make of him. It took a generation, but by 1930 they had succeeded in
reducing him in the public mind. In the process of succeeding,
however, they emasculated the discipline, impoverished economic
thought, muddled the minds of countless students, rationalized
free-riding by landowners, took dignity from labor, rationalized
chronic unemployment, hobbled us with today's counterproductive tax
tangle, marginalized the obvious alternative system of public
finance, shattered our sense of community, subverted a rising
economic democracy for the benefit of rent-takers, and led us into
becoming an increasingly nasty and dangerously divided
plutocracy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The present paper purports to
identify the elements of
<b>Neo-Classical Economics (NCE)</b> that were planted there to sap
and confound George, and show how they continue to warp, debase and
vitiate much of the discipline called economics. Once a paradigm is
well-ensconced it becomes a power in itself, a set of reflexes to
sort the true and false. Any exception spoils the web of
interpretation through which art seeks to make human experience
intelligible. Only the young, the brave, the energetic, the sincere
and the skeptical can break off such fetters. This work is addressed
and dedicated to them. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Neo-classical economics makes an
ideal of "choice." That sounds
good, and liberating, and positive. In practice, however, it has
become a new dismal science, a science of choice where most of the
choices are bad. "TANSTAAFL"
(There Ain't No Such
Thing As A Free Lunch) is the slogan and shibboleth. Whatever you
want, you must give up something good. As an overtone there is even a
hint that what one person gains he must take from another. The theory
of gains from trade has it otherwise, but that is a heritage from the
older classical economists. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George, in contrast, had a
genius for
reconciling-by-synthesizing. Reconciling is far better than merely
compromising. He had a way of taking two problems and composing them
into one solution, as we lay out in detail infra. He took two polar
philosophies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collectivism </span>and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">individualism</span>, and
synthesized a plan
to combine the better features, and discard the worse features, of
each. He was a problem-solver, who did not suffer incapacitating
dilemmas and standoffs.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As policy-makers, neo-classical
economists present us with
"choices" that are too often hard dilemmas. They are in the tradition
of Parson Malthus, who preached to the poor that they must choose
between sex or food. That was getting right down to grim basics, and
is the origin of a well-earned epithet, "the dismal science." Most
modern neo-classicals are more subtle (although the fascist wing of
the otherwise admirable ecology movement gets progressively less so).
Here are some dismal dilemmas that neo-classicals pose for us today.
For efficiency we must sacrifice equity; to attract business we must
lower taxes so much as to shut the libraries and starve the schools;
to prevent inflation we must keep an army of unfortunates unemployed;
to make jobs we must chew up land and pollute the world; to motivate
workers we must have unequal wealth; to raise productivity we must
fire people; and so on.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The neo-classical approach is the
"trade-off." A trade-off is a
compromise. That has a ring of reasonableness to it, but it presumes
a zero-sum condition. At the level of public policy, such
"trade-offs" turn into paralyzing stand-offs, where no one gets
nearly what he wants, or could get. It overlooks the possibility of a
<span style="font-style: italic;">reconciliation</span>, or synthesis,
instead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In such a resolution, we are
not limited by trade-offs between fixed A and B: we get more of
both. ...
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Before Keynes there was another
great
reconciler, Henry George. In
1879, George electrified the world by identifying a cause of the
boom/slump cycle, identifying a cause of inadequate demand for labor,
and, best of all, following through with a plausible, practicable
remedy. Like Keynes and Laffer after him, he turned people on by
saying "Forget the bitter trade-offs; we can have it all." &nbsp;</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George came out of a raw, naive
new colony, California, as a
scrappy marginal journalist. Yet his ideas exploded through the
sophisticated metropolitan world as though into a vacuum. His book
sales were in the millions. Seven short years after publishing
<a href="../George_P&P.html"><i>Progress and Poverty</i></a> in remote
California he nearly
took over as Mayor of New York City, the financial and intellectual
capital of the nation. He thumped also-ran Theodore Roosevelt, and
lost to the Tammany candidate (Abram S. Hewitt) only by being counted
out (Barker, pp.480-81; Myers, pp.356-58; Miller, p.11). Three more
years and he was a major influence in sophisticated Britain. In 1889,
incredibly, he became "adviser and field-general in land reform
strategy" to the Radical wing of the Liberal Party in Britain, where
he was not even a citizen. "It was inevitable that, when (Joseph)
Chamberlain bowed out, George should become the Radical philosopher"
(Lawrence, pp.105-06). It also happened that when Chamberlain bowed
out, the Radical wing became the Liberal Party. It adopted a land-tax
plank after 1891 (The "famous Newcastle Programme"), and came to
carry George's (muted) policies forward under successive Liberal
Governments of Campbell-Bannerman, Asquith, and Lloyd George.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How could a marginal man come out
of nowhere and make such an
impact? The economic gurus of the day, even as today, were in a
scolding mode, blaming unemployment on faulty character traits and
genes, and demanding austerity. They were not intellectually armed to
refute him or befuddle his listeners. He had studied the classical
economists, and used their tools to dissect the system. Neo-classical
economics arose in part to fill the void, to squeeze out such radical
notions, and be sure nothing like the Georgist phenomenon could
recur.&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html"> <span

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ... </p>
  <p><strong>The Tax Base</strong></p>
  <p>The next concern should be upon what base to impose a tax &#8212; not about
    taxing whom but taxing what. There are only three possibilities, as all revenue
    streams necessarily come from one of three factors of economic production &#8212;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1) upon resources found raw in nature (what was classically called land), <br>
          2) upon our labor, or <br>
    3) upon things created by human hands or minds (capital). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>No other source exists; every possible tax must be on one or some combination
    of these parts. Each of these factors has its price: the price of land is
    counted in economic rent; the price of labor is in wages, and the price of
    capital (its liquid form) is in interest.</p>
  <p>Any tax on capital has its downside effects, so that taxing savings causes
    people to save less, taxing consumption causes people to buy less, and taxing
    buildings causes people to build less. The result is that economists as well
    as businessmen usually frown upon taxing capital. Another alternative is
    to tax labor, but it is even more widely understood that taxing labor normally
    discourages people from working as much as they would in the absence of a
    tax. From this comes sentiment against taxing labor, even though for want
    of any alternative, people have today commonly come to accept it as a necessity.
    But electing to tax labor, just as for taxing capital, forecloses a discussion
    of the virtues of taxing land &#8212; not necessarily land as earth, but
    rather land as location. <strong>Yet land rent is the most attractive tax
    base of all, as rent is not earned; it is windfall income, entirely the result
    of
    being well situated in any market of scarce natural resources and where community
    demand (rather than one's own efforts) leads to an appreciation of that land's
    price. To be sure many people have learned to position themselves in situations
    where a land's market value is likely to rise &#8212; indeed these people
    come to think of themselves as astute investors. But the fact is that that
    market gain is not of their own doing at all; it is the result of common
    enterprise creating a surplus that comes to settle on land sites. An investment
    in land, in any form it might take, is speculation in greater or lesser degree.</strong></p>
  <p>Land in all its forms is a tax base that also conforms well to all the classic
    principles of sound tax theory as enumerated above. Land is classically taken
    to mean not just surfaces of the earth but places in time, in space, in any
    medium whether it be solid, liquid or gas, and even as a form of light, in
    the electromagnetic spectrum, and in life forms. One needs to return to 19th
    century classical economic definitions of the factors of production to appreciate
    the separate significance of land as it was understood in its manifold forms.<strong> One
    should ask how it is that land, so important to 19th century classical economic
    theory, has been given so little attention today in neoclassical
    economics.</strong> This is a story only now recovered from the dusty archives of
    academic economic history. Once understood and appreciated, it may be one
    of the greatest, if very silent, political revolutions of world history.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

POLITICAL economy is the simplest of the sciences. It is but the intellectual
recognition, as related to social life, of laws which in their moral aspect men
instinctively recognize, and which are embodied in the simple teachings of him
whom the common people heard gladly. But, like Christianity, political economy
has been warped by institutions which, denying the equality and brotherhood of
man, have enlisted authority, silenced objection, and ingrained themselves in
custom and habit of thought. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, Chapter

  </span> THE power of a special interest, though inimical to the general interest,
  so to influence common thought as to make fallacies pass as truths, is a great
  fact, without which neither the political history of our own time and people,
  nor that of other times and peoples, can be understood. A comparatively small
  number of individuals brought into virtual though not necessarily formal agreement
  of thought and action by something that makes them individually wealthy without
  adding to the general wealth, may exert an influence out of all proportion
  to their numbers. A special interest of this kind is, to the general interests
  of society, as a standing army is to an unorganized mob. It gains intensity
  and energy in its specialization, and in the wealth it takes from the general
  stock finds power to mold opinion. Leisure and culture and the circumstances
  and conditions that command respect accompany wealth, and intellectual ability
  is attracted by it. On the other hand, those who suffer from the injustice
  that takes from the many to enrich the few, are in that very thing deprived
  of the leisure to think, and the opportunities, education, and graces necessary
  to give their thought acceptable expression. They are necessarily the "unlettered," the "ignorant," the "vulgar," prone
  in their consciousness of weakness to look up for leadership and guidance to
  those who have the advantages that the possession of wealth can give. &#8212; <em>The

WE may be wise to distrust our knowledge; and, unless we have tested them, to
distrust what we may call our reasonings; but never to distrust reason itself.
. . . That the powers with which the human reason must work are limited and are
subject to faults and failures, our reason itself teaches us as soon as it begins
to examine what we find around us and to endeavor to look in upon our own consciousness.
But human reason is the only reason that men can have, and to assume that in
so far as it can see clearly it does not see truly, is in the man who does it
not only to assume the possession of a superior to human reason, but it is to
deny the validity of all thought and to reduce the mental world to chaos. &#8212; <em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe305.html">The

by the formation of parties, or the making of revolutions; but by the awakening
of thought and the progress of ideas. Until there be correct thought, there cannot

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The solution is to make the
regressive taxes pinch landowners. The
income tax, when new, was designed to do exactly that. Georgists like
Congressman Henry George, Jr. and Warren Worth Bailey took the lead
in shaping it to do so. Over time, though, it has changed into mainly
a payroll tax, and as it changed it became increasingly popular with
landowners. It served their greed and became the clarion call of
their constant clamor for "property tax relief."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
1942 Congress excluded 50
percent of "capital" gains from
taxable income, and broadened the definition of "capital" assets.</span>
As
top-bracket rates on "ordinary" income rose above 50 percent,
Congress capped capital gains rates at 25 percent. Meantime,
wage-tax withholding was sold as a wartime measure - "We must all do
our duty." <span style="font-weight: bold;">College professors were
dutifully indoctrinating their
students that the income tax is the perfect tax: fair, progressive,
allocationally neutral, all at once.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then income tax rates went wild,
going as high as 92 percent on
"ordinary" income (but capped at 25 percent for capital gains).
Federal and state income taxes became the mainstay of public finance.
Owners of income property soon learned to avoid almost all income
taxes by claiming short tax lives by which fictitious inflated
depreciation write-offs offset all their cash flow. Once a property
has exhausted its depreciation "basis," owner A sells the property to
owner B, who depreciates it all over again, and so on through several
rounds. The only "recapture" of this excess depreciation is when A
sells to B for a capital gain; in effect, the rent of income property
shows up as "capital gains." This tax burden is minimized by keeping
rates low on capital gains. ... <a

Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synopsis</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Land value taxation
(LVT)
has often been omitted from the lists of natural resources for which
eco-taxes are being advocated. LVT provides strong financial
encouragement for land to be put to its optimal use and will eliminate
speculation on land, as occupants must pay the full LVT whether the
land is being fully utilised or not. This leads to better land
management, a reduction in urban sprawl, less urban smothering of
agricultural land, and less farmland being pushed into hinterland.</small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT makes the investment in
resource-efficient infrastructure affordable because the resulting
enhanced land values are "recycled" back into public coffers. One
particular application of LVT to agricultural land provides much-needed
financial incentives for organic farming. Unlike other ecotaxes which
"sow the seeds of their own revenue demise," LVT actuallyincreases over
time as our environment is enhanced and is thus a stable revenue base. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This paper argues
that the LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from
monitoring human activity onto our use and abuse of natural resources,
as any responsible form of stewardship should. It suggests that only if
land users are prepared to pay the full cost of utilising resources
should private resource holding be permitted.</small><br>
<br>
<small>"The depletion of natural resources and
the despoliation of nature is due to a single reason: the failure
properly to measure the rental value of all of nature's resources, and
to make the users pay the community for the benefits they receive." F.
Harrison, "The Corruption of Economics" ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Why has land value taxation (LVT) frequently been omitted from
lists of
significant eco-taxes yet, as this paper will argue, LVT can be
enormously influential in its effect on economic and environmental
practices?</small><br>
<br>
<small>One reason lies in the confusion arising from how the very word
"land"
is used imprecisely or in different circumstances such as </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>land with agricultural value, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>(urban) land with largely locational value, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>land as the very soil itself, or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>even land in the broad and inclusive sense of meaning
natural resources in general.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Even within the discipline of
  macroeconomics, there have been three major shifts in the way land has
  been regarded, almost in the manner of a magician's sleight of
  hand.&nbsp; </small></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Scene 1 has the magician display a rabbit in a cage. </small></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Scene
            2 has the rabbit disappear. </small></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Scene 3 has the magician pull the "same" rabbit
              out of a hat.</small></div>
  </li>
  <li><small>Scene 1 was the era of classical economics, when the 3
    factors of
    production were labour, capital and land - and here the rabbit
    represents land principally in the sense of urban land with locational
    value, while other natural resources were accorded little or no value
    as they were considered to be drawn from an almost infinite storehouse.
    <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Scene 2 was the era of neoclassical economics, whose
    textbooks
    invariably started with a recognition that there were three factors of
    production but from then on treated land as simply a type of capital.
    Land was simply conflated with capital and the rabbit had disappeared! <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scene 3 is the era of the
    environmental reform of economics, when
    the rabbit suddenly reappears in the form of natural resources <span
 style="font-style: italic;">which
    effectively exclude land.</span></span> "Hang on!" squeals a
    freckle-faced boy in the
  front row, "that's a different rabbit!"</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The confusion between land and
capital
is well exemplified by the description of property prices which
comprise, of course, buildings and land. Whereas the former depreciate,
the latter usually appreciate, yet their escalating values are
invariably referred to as "house prices increases". Such confusion
demands an examination of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the
distinctive qualities of land (whose value is largely locational) </span>on
which the theory and practice of LVT is based:</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Unlike capital which is
produced and reproduced, land is fixed in supply ... </span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. There are all sorts of
substitutes
for capital items and for many natural resources, but there's no
substitute for land - at least, not while the Law of Gravity
holds!&nbsp;
...</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 3. Unlike capital, the value
of land
is not built up by the occupier but by the community (principally
through the increase in presence of population and through the further
provision of tax-funded infrastructure).&nbsp;</span> ... <a

Alanna Hartzok <a href="../docs/Hartzok_HG%27sST.html">In the History
of Thought: Henry George's "Single Tax"</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day,
while riding horseback in the Oakland
hills, merchant seaman and journalist Henry George had <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a startling epiphany. He realized that
speculation and private profiteering in the gifts of nature were the
root causes of the unjust distribution of wealth.</span> The insights
presented in <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>,
George's masterwork, launched him to fame. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">His policy
approach was known at that time as the "single tax" - meaning that
taxation should be shifted off of labor and onto the socially created
surplus value of land and other natural resources.</span> His message
reached as far as the great Russian Leo Tolstoy, who was so taken with
the idea that he frequently referred to George and "Georgism" in his
novel Resurrection.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the last 20 years of the 19th century George
built an impressive populist movement bent on solving the problem of
the wealth gap, and he died in 1897 while campaigning to be New York's
mayor. The "Georgists" were determined to free labor and all productive
effort from the burden of taxation. Land and natural resources were
gifts of nature to be fairly shared by all. The role of government
would be to secure democratic rights to the earth for all people via
the collection of resource rents, the surplus value accruing to natural
wealth, which would be distributed in social goods, services or by
direct citizen dividends.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">But just as this
solution to the rich/poor gap was gaining momentum, the Georgist
movement was stopped in its tracks. Wealthy individuals poured their
money into leading schools of economics to encourage the writing of
treatises against George and the movements he had spawned. </span>The
ethical perspective that land is a common heritage and the policy
approach of land value taxation were subsequently eliminated from the
field of economics. The newly dominant theory focused on only two
primary factors -- labor and capital -- with capital having the upper
hand as "employing labor." "Labor," of course, is quite capable of
self-employment given access to land. This is what the elites and the
plutocrats feared most - that labor would gain full power to directly
produce capital given conditions of equal rights to the resources of
the earth. ...&nbsp;</small>

Rights Democracy: Public Finance based on Early Christian Teachings</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... The early Christians were
attacked and persecuted and the Christian
land justice teachings were undermined by Roman law. Similarly, there
was a great movement to discredit the teachings of Henry George. Pope
Leo XIII issued the <span style="font-style: italic;">Rerum Novarum</span>
Encyclical in 1891 which propounded an exclusivist right to private
property in land, exhorting those without land to work harder, longer
and smarter to save money from which to buy land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[21]</span></small>&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Money
from vested interests poured into the University of Chicago, Columbia
University and other emerging schools of economics to thwart and
obscure the understanding and the solution to the land problem and the
wealth divide. Academics were paid to undermine Georgist economics
which had followed in the classical tradition and to instead develop an
approach to economics which minimized the contribution of nature's
gifts to the production process. </span>Land, the term in classical
economics which denotes all gifts of nature, was made a secondary
factor, a mere subset of capital. The two major factors became Labor
and Capital. The intellectual crime of the century -- the neoliberal
economics paradigm -- has predominated in the field of economics ever
since.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[22]&nbsp;

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What ever possessed the
neo-classicals to
leave such a mess?&nbsp; One
needs to know something of their times and politics.&nbsp; J.B. Clark
and
E.R.A. Seligman of Columbia University were obsessed with deflecting
proposals, strongly supported at the time and place they wrote, to
focus
taxation on land.&nbsp; <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/About_HG.html">Henry George</a>,
after all, was nearly elected
Mayor
of New York City in 1886 and 1897.&nbsp; Frank Knight, founder of The
Chicago School, followed them closely.&nbsp; That explains why some of
the points made herein may seem obvious
to readers who have been spared the formal conditioning
imposed on graduate students in economics.&nbsp; In graduate training,
however, the obvious is obscured, silenced, or denied.&nbsp;<span

sophistical, pedantic cant, which students learn to ape to distinguish
themselves from the laity and advance their careers.<small><span

<br>
<small>The dominance of
"fusers" is shown by the prevalence of <span style="font-weight: bold;">2-factor
models</span>, wherein
the world is divided into just labor and capital.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> Land
is melded with
capital, and simply disappears as a separate category, along with its
distinctive attributes.&nbsp; A number of economists don't buy it, but
don't do anything about it - acquiescing in error by silence,
indifference, passivity, or anxiety of the professional
consequences.&nbsp; They handle the question by "going into
denial," as it were, resolving a vexing issue by pretending it isn't
there. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Anything else spoils the
web of interpretation through which their art seeks to make human
experience intelligible.</span><small><span

especially
against such motivated forces as have an interest in hiding unearned
wealth behind the skirts of capital.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The market exchange of capital for land causes an elementary
failure in
the minds of many.&nbsp; Land and capital each have their prices and
may
be bought and sold for money.&nbsp; Each alike is part of an
individual's
assets, colloquially called his "capital".&nbsp; Each is a
store of value to the individual.&nbsp; What is true of each individual
must be true for all together, is the thinking: it is the "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fallacy
of composition.</span>" We will see herein that society cannot turn
land
into capital (A-6), and land is not a store of value for society (A- I
0).</small><br>
<br>
<small>The discipline has not totally eliminated land, but marginalized
it. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The discipline has not
totally terminated land: it is too subtle for outright skullduggery,
preferring equivocation and confusion.&nbsp; Rather, it has
marginalized it.&nbsp; </span>There is a subdiscipline called "Land
Economics," and
a journal of that name.&nbsp; There are journals of Agricultural
Economics, Urban Economics, Regional Science, Environmental Economics,
Natural Resources, and more.&nbsp; There are also whole disciplines of
Geography, Economic Geography, Military Science, Biogeography, Geology,
Geometry, Surveying, Astronomy, Theology, Ecology, Oceanography,
Meteorology, Soils, Physiography, Topography, and Hydrology, all
dealing
with The Earth and Nature and Creation as definable topics distinct
from
man's works. ... <br>
<br>
</small><small>Common micro theory finesses Time.&nbsp; It deals with
economic
relations
as though they occurred at a point in time <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(and space as well); as though they
were relations of coexistence, rather than a cavalcade of events in
sequence</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes two points
are allowed (short run and long).&nbsp; Thus micro theory can ignore
the
birth of capital, its growth, maturity, senescence, death, burial, and
replacement, vital elements of its difference from land.&nbsp; Time,
and
relations of sequence,&nbsp;are hived off to the far satellite
of "finance," usually
not even taught in departments of economics.&nbsp; Time is also
referred
to under "history of economic thought," as an obsession of some
19th century Austrians who wrote quaintly of "roundabout"
(time-using) methods of production.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5&nbsp;</span></small>
Relations of sequence are found in
macro, but not firmly integrated with microtheory, which is the
enduring
core of the discipline.&nbsp; Microtheory still deals with relations of
coexistence in time, and space as well. As A. A. Milne once wrote,
"It isn't really anywhere, it's somewhere else instead." Of
neoclassical theory we may add, "It isn't really anytime, it's some
other time instead."<small><span

theorists, who produce new words and concepts monthly, raising
insurmountable barriers of communication.&nbsp; These seal off the
profession not just from the outside world, not just from reality, but
from itself, as it subdivides economic thought within elaborate mazes
behind ever thicker walls of new argot.&nbsp; Jesuits quibbling with
Jansenists in 18th Century France were never more arcane nor tiresome
than most economic theorists today.&nbsp; These elaborate structures
rise, however, upon the spaceless, timeless basis of micro theory
inherited from J.B. Clark and Frank Knight.&nbsp; They can be no better
than their foundations.&nbsp; Indeed, that is what makes them so
tiresome.</span></small><br>

essay
gives 10 primary reasons why land is distinct from capital (and of
course
from mankind itself) as an economic input.&nbsp; Then it gives 18
important economic consequences thereof, and their policy
implications.&nbsp; </span>Making land markets, land policy, and land
taxation
work well for the general welfare is a major challenge for economists

statesmen.&nbsp; They have neglected it too long by crediting and

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - It pervades the
culture of the profession. Most
members are looking for grants and promotions to put frosting on
their cake. They call it, "Responding to the incentive structure,"
giggle nervously, and shuffle the blame onto "the system." They
abandon personal moral responsibility, and quickly become part of the
system themselves. They rationalize their own dereliction by
attacking those who expose it, turning themselves into a generation
of vipers. Grants come from those with money. Follow the money trail.
Most administrators are even worse: they push faculty members to get
outside grants, whatever the source. They only occasionally decline
one when faced with embarrassing publicity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Look at the names and histories of
major grantors and patrons of
the past: Stanford, Rockefeller, Russell Sage, Carnegie, Hewitt,
Cornell, Wharton ... Look at the governing boards of major private
and public institutions. It's all there to see, for those that have
eyes to see, minds to draw the obvious conclusions, and hearts to
carry on the good fight for the public interest. Upton Sinclair
spelled it out pretty well back in 1923 or so, in "<b><i>The Goose

What's your take on the Pennsylvania story?
Are the landlords running scared from the new 'Whiskey Tax
Rebellion'?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Pennsylvania
allows its cities what is called
"local option" on property tax policy. This gives each city the
option of down-taxing buildings and up-taxing land. An accelerating
number of cities have chosen this option, the latest being
Allentown.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Landowners can't run, not without
leaving their land behind; and
the idea is not to scare them, but show most of them they have more
to gain from un-taxing buildings than they lose from up-taxing land.
Un-taxing buildings encourages new building, with all the gains that
brings. When a city gets old and rundown, a lot of people get the
point.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The opponents have several
points from which to attack. Now they
are focusing on the State Legislature. As it happens, Harrisburg
itself is one of the cities that has adopted the option of
down-taxing buildings, and the good results may be seen by looking
out the window; but many legislators get their ideas and motivations
from elsewhere. The great danger to the movement in Pa. is that about
when half the cities will have chosen to down-tax buildings, the
legislature will follow the bad example of California and replace
the property tax by raising state income and sales taxes. ...&nbsp;</small></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b style="font-style: italic;">TPR</b><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> - For an economics professor, you're said
to be
quite an expert on the environment, what's the connection?</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Economic
analysis, properly used, can serve the
cause of environmentalism. The neo-classical economists abused both
economics and the environment badly, as a byproduct of their drive to
discredit classical political economy, and Henry George. John Bates
Clark wrote that land is not scarce, that mankind can convert capital
into land without limit, and create as much as we please. He wrote
that natural resources have no value to mankind until and unless they
are privatized; that privatization itself is what creates value. Our
universities churn out thousands of new economists yearly, imbued
with such attitudes. When Rachel Carson kicked off the new
environmentalism in 1962 with her "<b><i>Silent Spring,</i></b>" most
economists trashed or disdained her: they 'd been trained that
way.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Faced with the obvious growth of
environmental sentiment,
economists dealt with it as they have with other problems: they
absorbed it in the discipline, then marginalized it. Now they can say
it is part of economics, while they proceed to ignore or trivia lize
it in their major policy pronouncements, wherein endless territorial
expansion continues to be not just a goal, but a necessity to make
the system work.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The legitimate goals of
environmentalists, they coopt and distort.
Here are two examples. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>They'll tell you that it's not OK to promote oil
conservation by taxing withdrawals, but it is OK to do so by
monopolizing the industry - monopolists are our best friends. </small></li>
  <li><small>They'll tell you it's not OK to check polluters by taxing
their effluents, but it is OK to give them property rights to pollute,
based on past emissions, and then buy those rights back from them at
their price. You think I'm just making that up? I wish I were! The EPA
is actually applying that idea around the country. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thank you, John B. Clark; thank
you, neo-classical economics. It
all follows from Clark's efforts to avoid any recognition that
natural resources are common property: in this case, the air itself
is turned into private property. Your very right to breathe, you have
to buy from major owners of the air. And how did they establish that
ownership? By their track records of dumping their crud in the air in
the past. It beggars belief, but there it is: it shows what the war
against Henry George has made of the discipline of economics.</small><small>&nbsp;</small></div>

If Earth's ecosystem and poorest people will
be the largest beneficiaries of the reform you advocate, how will it
ever gain public acceptance in America's increasingly money-driven
political system? If the press will never acknowledge it and the
education system is so lost and blind, how can this reform ever
happen? Are Georgists like the character in 1984?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Every system
must purify itself from time to
time, or be destroyed. How long that takes depends on how strong a
base you started from, and how strong your rivals are. The USA
started from a strong base, built in part by the Progressives
(including many Georgists) and the New Dealers (in spite of some of
their destructive moves). Now, our leaders think we are riding high,
just because the stock market is rising, even though real wage rates
have fallen for 25 years, our debts are staggering, our liabilities
and contingent liabilities exceed our assets, our biggest growth
industry is building jails, our population is losing its literacy,
our major cities have decayed, and so on. Marx was right about one
thing, at least: the system carries the seeds of its own
destruction.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our leaders have done a good job
of subverting our rivals, in part
by forcing on them the ideas of neo-classical economics, the ideas
that originated as part of the anti-Georgist campaigns. Japan gave us
a good run for a while, but got suckered into aping our worst habits,
and hence a good old-fashioned American-style land boom and bust that
has knocked them out of the race for a while. Most of S.E. Asia has
now followed suit.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It's a delicate balance. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The haves can brainwash the have-nots
just so long, until reality breaks through, as in 1929. When it does,
you want to be ready with a plan tailored to the times, which
Georgists at that time were not. </span>Meantime, we keep the idea

</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><small>Turning land-value
gains into capital gains</small></b></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually a "land gain", that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
new entries into the </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Forbes</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> or </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Over the past 40 years I have
specialised in the study of the
factors that raise or lower the nation's overall real estate prices
-- rising income and savings levels, shifting interest rates and the
financial sector's supply of mortgage credit, as well as changes in
the tax laws and related market-shaping rules. This work for Wall
Street banks and institutional investors was burdened by the absence
of reliable data on the value of land and buildings.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The official
nationwide real estate statistics do suggest that a politically
motivated asymmetry is at work in the economy, benefiting real
estate,</span> which I shall now attempt to identify.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Hiding the free
lunch</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil
wins at the point where he
convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
that no free lunch exists. But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done.&nbsp; ...</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
appraisal methods do not
acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
changed in comparison to the property's overall value?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve multiplies the
building's original cost by the
rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is agreed that any
explanation of land/building relations
should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
<b><i>uniform</i></b> and <b><i>homogeneous</i></b> as possible. By
that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
accordingly.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
accepted, then I believe that economists
would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
opposite usually is done.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Where did all the
land value go?</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>AS REAL ESTATE AGENTS explain to
prospective buyers, the three
keys are "location, location, and location." So we are brought back
to the role played by land-value gains in the strategy pursued by
investors and developers.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In view of real estate's dominant
role in the economy, it is
ironic that no attempt has been made to provide better statistics.
<b>My research has shown that the Fed's methodology undervalues land
by as much as $4.5 trillion.</b> As matters stood in 1994, for
instance, the Fed estimated the U.S. economy to hold some $20
trillion in real assets (excluding human capital, for which no
official statistics are published). The land's value was calculated
to be $4.4 trillion, and building values $9 trillion. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">My estimates
based on historical values suggests that land rather than buildings
represents two thirds of the nation's overall real estate value -- $9
trillion, leaving building values at just half this amount.</span> <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In sum, just as real estate
lending fuels land speculation, so the
withdrawal of such credit leaves property markets to decline,
sometimes with a crash, as occurred in Japan after 1990 when its
financial bubble burst. Should this rise and fall be attributed to
buildings or to land? It seems to me that inasmuch as the price rise
and fall is homogeneous, applying to parking lots as well as to
skyscrapers, we should attribute it to land. This achieves the
logical symmetry of applying to the downturns as well as upturns in
the real estate cycle. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Immortally aging
buildings</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>INCOME TAX LIABILITY may be
minimized in two ways.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The most general -- and also the most economically
pernicious -- is through the tax deductibility of interest</b>. ... </small></li>
  <li><small><b>The second way to minimize tax liability, is to
depreciation the building, that is, annually deduct from taxable income
part of the purchase price until it's all deducted and the building is
"written off" ...
    </b></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
fiscal privilege has created a phantom real estate economy.
Buildings acquire death-defying lives, metamorphosing time and again
for the purpose of enabling their owners to avoid paying income
taxes.</span> For commercial real estate investors as a whole, the
repeated
depreciation of buildings has made commercial real estate investment
largely exempt from the income tax. Homeowners are not permitted to
charge depreciation on their own residences, but only on buildings
that they rent out.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The tax laws governing
depreciation thus turn largely on how much
value is assigned to buildings relative to the land, which is not
depreciable. Like manufacturers, real estate owners are permitted to
count part of the revenue over and above their current expenses as a
return of their capital investment, as distinct from taxable earnings
on capital. No income taxes are levied on this part of their revenue.
That is only fair, because an investor who buys a $100 bond only pays
tax on the interest, not on the original $100 principal. Likewise,
industrialists can recover their initial investment in plant and
equipment without being taxed. Their "sunk cost" gets reimbursed, so
that they get their capital back by the time the equipment wears out
or becomes obsolete.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For
real estate, however, the economics are unique. Machinery
rarely can be re-depreciated, but this is not true of buildings as
long as they are kept in proper repair. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintenance and repairs
typically consume about 10 percent of the rental value.</span> For
business
owners, the explicit purpose of this expenditure is to maintain the
building's value intact, so that it can survive year after year and
avoid obsolescence while its site value rises. If a building is sold
at a higher price, its assessment usually is raised.</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><small> Suppose a
property is sold for twice the $1 milliuon the owner paid for it. The
local appraiser is likely to say; "I see you've sold your building
for $2 million. Under my rule of thumb, I appraise the land as half
this value, and the building as half, so that gives you a $1 million
dollar building." Under this rule, the building that was formerly
priced at $500,000 can be re-depreciated at a price that builds in
this $500,000 gain. In this way a substantial portion of the rise in
site value of non-depreciable land is treated as depreciable building
value.&nbsp; ...</small></span><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PoICG.html">The Partiality of
Indexing Capital Gains</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Heller and his contemporaries also
knew that the incentive
driving job-making investing is <span style="font-weight: bold;">MRORAT,
the Marginal Rate of Return
after Taxes. </span><small>[<i>Economists of the 1960s, following
Keynes, called it the MEC, or "Marginal Efficiency of Capital," an
awkward phrase now little used. Awkward or not, and intended or not, it
had great historical consequence by putting the emphasis where it
belongs, on marginal rates of return, excluding rents.</i>]</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The marginal idea is pivotal. The
Average ROR includes
rents; the Marginal ROR is the pure return to new investment, Keynes'
"inducement to invest," which is activating and functional.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These Heller ideas were invoked
again by supply-siders in
early Reagan times. However, policy over the course of the 80s lost
the substance of that policy, keeping only the guise. Domestic
leaders forgot the usage of "investment" in macro-economics. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They
gradually slipped into an illusion that buying and holding and
bidding up old assets like non-reproduceable lands and stocks would
make jobs and produce goods. They forgot to distinguish old from new
assets, and marginal from average returns on investment (average
returns, recall, include rents). Both critics and supporters of
"supply-side" policies now darken counsel by debating current
policies in supply-side terms, when the terms no longer describe the
policy at issue.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Along with normal confusion,
there is intelligence behind
such error. The case for downtaxing gains depends in part on
exploiting confusion, in order to pass off rent-raising as an
incentive for saving and investing, and so to disguise its
non-functionality and eminent taxability. The policy is called
"supply side," but isn't. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The litmus test of the sincerity
of capital-formation champions is
their treatment of irreproduceable land. Raising rents and land
prices, and protecting the gains from taxation, is purely
distributive, with no power to foster saving and investing. On the
contrary, a higher share for rent and/or land purchase must mean a
lower share for the investor in new capital.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignoring
land and its distinctive attributes has the effect
of treating land as though it were true, reproduceable capital, to be
formed by saving and investing, to be routinely worn out and replaced
in the normal course of life and business. </span>It lets advocates of

 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><small>An intriguing question
still remains unanswered: "How can such an
intrinsically-natural economic and social system remain virtually
unknown to the world?" By being acquainted with some extraordinary and
little-known episodes in history, things might become much clearer. ...
</small><br>
<br>
<small>Geonomics is nothing new - indeed, can anything so fundamental
as
sharing land and natural resources be novel? Biblical prophets made
pronouncements such as "The profit of the earth is for all" (Eccles.
5:9) as well as "The land shall not be sold forever; for the land is
Mine" (Leviticus 25:23) - hence the biblical "Jubilee Year." ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT'S MISSING? YOU'RE STANDING
ON IT!</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Basically, neo-classical economics leaves out land and natural
resources from any proper philosophical discussion. In economic
equations land is bundled in with capital, ignoring the different
nature and economic behaviour of land, and setting the scene for the
impossibly complex and warped "economic paradigm" with which we are
burdened today.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Our birthright has been sold or given to those who got in before
us,
with economic ramifications that are not obvious (so thorough has been
the indoctrination of neoclassical economics). Yet those who study it
today often shake their heads in despair, as the assumptions made to
get its models to work often assume away any connection with reality.
One could equally well come up with an aerodynamic equation for flying
pigs &#8230;&#8230; assuming, of course, 'sufficient thrust'!</small><br>
<br>
<small>Who were the perpetrators? In the U.S.A., homeland of George,
they were
principally the railroad barons, bankers and plutocrats. In the late
1800s, universities there were mainly funded by wealthy benefactors
including many with a lot to lose from Georgist reforms. The academic
system was coerced by its paymasters, who protested against the
"revolutionary" ideas of George and withdrew funding from a number of
academics who kept Georgist economics on their curricula. The others
soon got the message.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In Britain, which three times had a majority of Georgist
sympathisers
in the democratically-elected House of Commons in the early 20th
century, the opposition was the "nobility" - the Lords, Dukes, Earls
and Barons who comprised the landed class. Controlling the House of
Lords, they fought tooth and nail to prevent structural reform. This
point marks the introduction of a degree of socialism, when the
populace was placated by palliative social welfare. Then along came
World War I and the Georgist movement, having lost its momentum, began
its slide from public view.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Many other factors contributed to the fall of Georgist
popularity (and
therefore the ascendancy of today's neoclassical economics). Those who
support the politics and wealth of The Vatican will not be pleased to
be reminded that in 1891 Pope Leo XIII issued a papal encyclical, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Rerum Novarum</span>, which was a
thinly-disguised attack on Georgist economics.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

Michael Hudson and Kris Feder: <a
 href="../docs/Hudson_Feder_RECGD.html">Real Estate and the Capital
Gains Debate</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Much of the public discussion of
capital gains policy has been
conducted with little reference to empirical research as to their
actual character and composition in the US economy. Capital gains, and
savings in general, are defended on the assumption that they are
automatically transformed into new direct investment. Yet the more
layers has the debt pyramid, the smaller is the proportion of savings
used to finance direct investment. Moreover, our investigation suggests
that a large and expanding share of the economy's capital gains -- as
they are defined, measured and taxed -- has little discernible impact
on net investment or employment.</small><br>
<br>
<small>IRS estimates of capital gains measure only the small proportion
that
individuals are obliged to declare after all the exemptions and
exclusions have been utilized. There is no estimate of the volume of
capital gains generated each year, and no adequate breakdown as to
where these gains occur. This statistical lacuna means that the
economic cost of assorted tax loopholes is not being calculated. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">There is no sound
statistical basis for calculating the total returns being taken by
investors, or the proportion of those returns paid in </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">taxes.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span>When
statistics are lacking, it often is because some interest
groups are benefiting in ways they prefer not to see quantified and
publicized. If land assessments lag behind actual increases in market
value, for instance, land speculators, as well as homeowners, will pay
less than their legislated tax share. Also -- and of direct relevance
to
our thesis -- the failure to distinguish statistics on land values and
other real estate gains from non-real-estate capital gains in industry
and finance makes it easier for the real estate industry to get its own
taxes reduced along with industries in which capital gains tax cuts do
indeed tend to spur productivity.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Academic economists likewise have been remarkably slow to
address this
shift away from earned income to capital gains. It is true that
nineteenth-century land reformers such as John Stuart Mill and Leon
Wahas defined land-value gains as an &#8220;unearned increment,&#8221; and urged
that they be collected by the community at large, whose economic
activity was, after all, responsible for creating these gains. Ever
since Henry George brought matters to a head in <span
 style="font-style: italic;"><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></span></small>
(1879),
however, economics has largely dropped the analysis of land-value
gains, and indeed, of land itself<small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>Wealthy
investors have won congressional support for
real estate exemptions in large part by mobilizing the economic
ambitions of homeowners. Most families&#8217; major asset, after all, is
their home. Two Federal Reserve studies trace the rise in gross house
value from 26 percent of household wealth in 1962 to 30.1 percent in
1983 (falling back to 28.5 percent in 1989).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">43</span></small>
Household real estate assets substantially exceeded holdings of stocks,
bonds and trust funds (20.5 percent in 1989), liquid assets (17
percent) and total debt (14 percent).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">44</span></small> The
giveaway to real estate interests is thus presented ostensibly as a
popular middle class measure. The real estate industry (and the
financial sector riding on its shoulders) have found that the middle
classes are willing to cut taxes on the wealthy considerably, as long
as their own taxes are cut even lightly. It is no surprise that
President Clinton&#8217;s first major concession to the pressure for cutting
capital gains taxation is directed at homeowners, despite the fact that
preferences for home ownership cannot be justified as a boost to
entrepreneurial investment. Such is the foreshortened economic
perspective of our times.</small><br>

<small>The LBO movement epitomizes the real estate industry&#8216;s strategy,
applying the developer&#8217;s traditional debt-pyramiding techniques to the
buying and selling of manufacturing companies. Raiders emulated
developers who borrowed money to buy or construct buildings and make
related capital improvements, agreeing to pay interest to their
mortgage bankers or other lenders, putting down as little equity of
their own as possible. Having set things in motion, the landlord uses
the rental income to carry the interest, principal, taxes and
maintenance charges while he waits for a capital gain to accrue. The
idea is to amortize the loan as slowly as possible so as to minimize
annual carrying charges, while paying them out of the CCA.</small><br>
<br>
<small>For many decades securities analysts have pored over corporate
balance
sheets in search of undervalued real estate whose book value does not
reflect gains in market value. From the merger and acquisition movement
of the 1960s through the takeover wave of the&nbsp;1980s,
the raider&#8217;s strategy has been to borrow money to buy the target
company&#8217;s stock, and then sell off its real estate and other assets to
repay the creditors, hoping that something will be left for himself
after settling the debts incurred in the process. For the bankers and
other creditors, LBOs were a way to put savings to work earning higher
rates of interest.&nbsp; The ensuing junk bond commotion pushed
interest rates over 15 percent for high-risk securities, whose major
risk was that quick capital gains and the cash flow available from
re-depreciating properties would not cover the interest payments to the
institutional investors rounded up by Drexel Burnham and the other
investment bankers who underwrote the takeovers.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The object of building, like buying and selling companies, is
thus by
no means only to earn rental income. Most cash flow is pledged to
lenders as debt service in any case. In a world of income taxation
subject to loopholes, sophisticated investors aim not so much to make
profits as to reap capital gains -not only in the stock and bond
markets, but also in real estate, other natural resources, and the
monopoly privileges that have come to underlie much of the pricing of
securities today.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As developers borrow money to finance real estate purchases,
lenders,
for their part, use the real estate sector as a market to absorb and
service the economy's mounting stock of savings, applying most of the
rental cash flow to pay interest to savers. The end result is that most
total returns are taken by the wealthiest ten percent responsible for
nearly all the economy's net saving. Viewing US economic statistics
from this perspective shows that not to calculate capital gains in the
national income accounts alongside directly &#8220;earned&#8221; income helps
foster the illusion that more equality exists among Americans than
actually is the case. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The fact is
that earned income is more equally distributed than unearned gains. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This distinction between real estate (and by extension, other
natural
resource industries and monopolies) and the rest of the economy helps
explain the familiar economic rule that inequalities of wealth tend
historically to exceed inequalities of income. The reason is that the
wealthiest layers of society control even more of the economy's assets
-- and the capital gains on these assets -- than they do its income.
They
also obtain a larger proportion of cash flow and other non-taxable
income than they do of taxable &#8220;earned&#8221; income. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This phenomenon has long been known, but not well explained.
Edward
Wolff has shown that wealth is more unequally distributed than income,
but he leaves capital gains out of account in explaining how the
American economy has grown more top-heavy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span></small> It is
unequal wealth that is primarily responsible for generating inequality
of incomes. The more the returns to wealth can avoid taxation by being
categorized as capital gains, the faster this inequality will polarize
society.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>43 Wolff (1995), p. 27.
&#8220;The top
one percent of wealth holders
has typically held in excess of one-quarter of total household wealth,
in comparison to the 8 or 9 percent share of income received by the top
percentile of the income distribution.&#8221;</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Given the current US depreciation laws and
related
institutions, to lower the capital gains tax rate across the board is
to steer capital and entrepreneurial resources into a search for
unearned rather than earned income. It rewards real estate speculators
and corporate raiders as it shifts the burden of taxation to people
whose primary source of income is their labor. The budget crisis
aggravated by such a policy also ends up forcing public resources to be
sold off to meet current expenses -- sold to the very wealth-holders
being
freed from taxation. In this way wealth consolidates its economic power
relative to the rest of society, and translates it into political power
so as to shit? the tax burden onto the shoulders of others. The first
element of this strategy has been to defer revenue into channels that
are taxed only later, as capital gains. The second has been to tax
these gains at a lower rate than earned income -- a&nbsp; fight that
has broken
out in earnest following the 1996 presidential elections.&nbsp; </small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
is Land Rent?</span></small><br>
<small>John Houseman, an actor perhaps most widely known as Professor
Kingsfield in the long-running TV series, The Paper Chase, later became
the pitchman for Smith Barney. In that advertisement, his tag line was
"We make money the old-fashioned way -- we earn it."</small><br>
<br>
<small>That we should earn our money rather than live off the efforts
of
others seems a simple enough moral tenet. But it seems to have lost its
cogency in contemporary economic thought. More than a century ago John
Stuart Mill noted that</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Landlords
grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold
title.</span><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(1)
</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Today, on the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
unearned surplus which classical
economists called rent</span> attaches to monopoly titles -- largely
the
scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">and has
totally disappeared from economic calculus.</span> Yet this is the
primary
vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(2)</span></small> The
surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
rightful entitlement.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of
cities
where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
personal or market exchanges. The land value in New York City is higher
than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an
obsolete power plant, not have to be razed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(3)</span></small> Land
values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend also
to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
areas. Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in the
United States illustrate the point. ...&nbsp; <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How Our Towns Got That
Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As recently as a century ago
classical economic thought still
regarded land for the most part as the common heritage of mankind.
From Adam Smith, through Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and finally
with John Stuart Mill economic productivity was regarded as a
function of three interacting factors: land, labor, and capital. John
Locke also accepted these premises. To achieve optimal economic
productivity, one had to exact the appropriate price from each of
those factors. The price of labor was in wages; the price of capital
was interest; and the price of land, particularly following the
thinking of David Ricardo, was rent. Rent in its classical sense
means payment for the use of something in fixed supply, or, more
generally, payments above the costs incurred for its creation.
Disequilibriums and inefficiencies in economic development resulted
if the appropriate prices were not paid for each factor. But, as we
shall see, there were powerful interests in this country, bent on not
seeing any rent extracted from land use, that persuaded the nascent
economics profession at the end of the 19th century no longer to
regard land as a separate factor and to redefine the terms of
production instead in two- factor theory. This was concurrent with
the inclusion of land as property, since called "real property." </small><br>
<br>
<small>As land came to be transferred to other nobility and usurped
under
title in fee simple rather than in usufruct, it came to be regarded
as a private financial asset. Earlier it was regarded as part of
nature, much like air, water, wind and weather. Accounting practices
now listed land as an asset "owned" in fee simple, and as a liability
on the other side of balance sheets in money "owed" to banks. This
tendency has been extended today so that we have privatized much of
our air, water, wind, and even sunlight. Land came to be simply one
kind of capital, nothing special, nothing requiring further
treatment. Ricardo's Law of Rent became an artifact of intellectual
history. The conflation of land into capital to create two-factor
economics is one of the greatest paradigm shifts in the evolution of
social philosophy. How the premises and terms of economic discourse
have been changed has been documented for the first time in a new
book by a California professor of economics, Mason Gaffney. The
account is put forth in fascinating detail entitled, <b><i><a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">The
Corruption of Economics</a>.</i></b> It was indeed a corruption of a
discipline, a deliberate putsch by powerful economic forces with an
interest in seeing such definitions changed, and we have all been
paying the price since that time. This revealing thesis is what I
really want to relate to you, and to explain the dire consequences it
has had for us in our contemporary world. I have come to believe it;
it makes sense to me, both historically and in contemporary analysis,
from several perspectives.</small><br>
<br>
<small><a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><b>The Corruption of
Economics</b>
</small><br>
<small>As I explained, classical economics emerged from a school of
thinkers known as the Scottish moralists in the latter part of the
18th century. There ultimately evolved three major schools of
economic thought a century later, one the continuing tradition of
Adam Smith through J.S. Mill, a second being the aggressive and
emerging school of Marxism, and the third a proposal for two-factor
economics being pressed largely by interests in America. Marxism was
never a major force in United States; the primary challenge to the
classical tradition came from what has since come to be known as
neo-classical economics.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Gaffney has for the
first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly-established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged. What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America. By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The classical tradition of
economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age: Henry George. All
but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the assiduous
disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book, <b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></i></b>, sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
traveled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and traveled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In classical economics, the
definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather than being
returned to society in rent. The failure of society to recapture the
appropriate level of land rent from titleholders led also to
depression of labor wages at the margin, creating poverty and
artificial scarcity of labor where otherwise it could be relieved.
Hence the title of George's book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.
George recognized that the value of any land parcel arose out of its
social activity, not from anything which a titleholder might have
done to it. He recognized that many, perhaps most, titleholders in
land were speculators, reaping the benefit of others' investments,
and selling out at last when their price was met. Hence it made sense
that society had a right to a return on what it had brought about, as
well as from the fact that those titles could never be other than
leaseholds. That land rent, shortly confused by use of the words
"single tax," was, to George, the rightful return to society.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
railroad barons of the 19th century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names.</span></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>Johns Hopkins, Andrew
Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all <span style="font-weight: bold;">as attached to
various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. </span>They were
able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors, to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885. The actual
intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got appointed and
promoted, who was funded in research, which were given endowed
chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation with
defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount preoccupation
of all of these figures. The central figures were:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President
of MIT
and Director of the Census Bureau.</small></li>
  <li><small>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of
economics
at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
own Institute with railroad money.</small></li>
  <li><small>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia
University,
and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
then Smith College.</small></li>
  <li><small>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at
Columbia
University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These figures are even today the
honored founders of an esteemed
profession. So great was their victory over rival schools of thought
that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear thinking and
virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten. The
lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, Friedman,
Harberger and now thousands of Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed,
when Henry George ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against
the wealthy patrician Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who
had recently recruited Clark to come to Columbia. To really
understand the academic tension of the period, one must look at the
published papers, the speeches and debates, the newspaper articles,
and the citations at the end of those articles. These, even more than
the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments, explain how
much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. <b>Was it for the
falsity of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then
have managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather,
it was the threat George represented to powerful interests that
required him to be defeated</b>, and in doing so they succeeded but
only in the short run, as they were within decades victims of their
very successes. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Today we see that the
railroads have failed in this
country for lack of traffic. It will soon be evident why.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a
progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base. </small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still
persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a
small minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they
are, they are among its most esteemed members.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Two-factor economics, however, had
advantages to influential
individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit. This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. In
three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner. When a railroad magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. All across America, land speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.</small><small>...<a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">read

  Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics 
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As with all nineteenth century
moral philosophers, Henry George
subscribed to a belief in natural law. The natural order of things as
he saw it required that land be held in usufruct and that rent from
such should be returned to society. The theory was inspired by his
deeply religious roots and grounded in his reading of the prominent
thinkers that predated him. The natural order was also a moral order,
and the failure to comply with the order of nature and society as he
saw it was a perversion of justice. The fruits of the land belonged to
everyone, just as the fruits of one&#8217;s own labor were uniquely one&#8217;s
own. Since one owned one&#8217;s body, one was entitled to keep the product
of one&#8217;s physical efforts. Society had no more right to confiscate the
earnings of one&#8217;s sweat and brow than it ought to leave in the hands of
rich landowners the rent that was everyone&#8217;s inherent birthright to be
shared. There were just and unjust
taxes, and the only just tax was that which grew out of rent, of the
unearned increment that visited certain land sites as windfall gains
because of the efforts and investments by the community. Income and
excise taxes were unjust and confiscatory&#8212; even theft, as especially
were tariffs. Taxing or collecting land rent alone was the means of
ending poverty and restoring progress. Indeed many Georgists reject use
of the word tax entirely, preferring instead to talk instead about rent
collection. There is even a lapel button Georgists use that says
&#8220;Abolish all taxes; collect ground rent instead.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Georgist Economics:
Moral Premises</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>What distinguished Henry
George&#8217;s views from those of his
adversaries in the last decade of his life was his assertion that
economics was necessarily a moral science. Unlike those who became the
founders of the American Economics Association in 1885, most of whom
were transitional figures to what would become neoclassical economics,
the primary focus of George and his disciplines was economic justice.
This is not to say that explanation was cast aside; indeed the subtitle
of his magnum opus, <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span>,
was <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">An Inquiry
into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with
Increase of Wealth . . . The Remedy</span>. Why, he asked, in the midst
of such boundless plenty is there such abject poverty? He would
dedicate his book, first published in 1879, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;to those who, seeing the vice and
misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and
privilege, feel the possibility of a higher social state and would
strive for its attainment.&#8221;</span> He had known poverty first hand when
he was struggling to support his young family and establish himself as
a printer, a journalist and a publisher. He could also see before him
the fruits of land and nature easily available to be harvested but for
its legal capture by monopoly titleholders. He wrote of all this in
some six books and countless other essays, the focus always on the
theme of economic justice. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is far easier to outline the
basic premises of Georgist economics
than it is to do so for the emerging field of ecological economics.
Georgism is a tradition that grew out of a clearly formed tradition of
19th century classical economics and has been refined further for the
past century. It was neoclassical economics that diverged from the
reigning orthodoxy. The differences between the classical tradition as
represented and defended by Henry George and the emerging neoclassical
school were vividly portrayed from their earliest divergence, even to
the staging of formal debates between George and the new orthodoxy&#8217;s
adherents. <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">75</span>
In contrast, ecological economics along with other emerging heterodox
schools is itself very much a reaction to the neoclassical tradition&#8217;s
insensitivities and failures. The differences between ecological
economics and the floundering discipline of neoclassical economics are
as much by way of the former&#8217;s criticism of the latter as they are an
enunciation of clear starting points.</small><br>
<br>
To be sure, neoclassical economics emerged gradually over a period of
some fifty years, and only reached its heyday, one might argue, with
the arrival of <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">Paul Samuelson</a>. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Samuelson, the
MIT economist whose text has gone through some 16 editions and has
outsold all other texts combined once said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care who writes
a
nation&#8217;s laws . . . if I can write its economics textbooks.&#8221; </span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">76</span> The
neoclassical position developed ever greater abstract mathematical
applications, with models ever more detached from &#8220;real world&#8221; market
forces. This system of analysis now has reached a point of questionable
utility due to its hermetic and Newtonian emulations.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">77 </span>Little
by little, one premise and formula after another have been cast aside,
to a point now that there is a broad recognition among economic
theorists at least that the discipline faces an intellectual crisis.<span

enumerating further criticisms that have been
levied against neoclassical economic thinking, something that has been
done far better elsewhere than is possible here, suffice it to say that
some of the most compelling charges have been made by the ecological
economists.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">79</span></small>
The most trenchant one as explicated by economist Nicholas
Georgescu-Roegen is its violation of the basic laws of physics.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">80 </span></small>It
assumes a continuing draw-down of the earth&#8217;s store of energy, of which
there is, of course, only a finite amount. If the economy continues to
expand to include all elements of the earth, it will consume so many
resources, particularly energy resources, that ultimately life itself
is destroyed. One study calculated that if everyone in the world lived
at the level of the average American, three &#8220;earths&#8221; would be necessary
to accommodate us all. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">81</span></small> The
challenge, argue the ecological economists, is to structure economic
analysis and the economy itself in such a way that markets are
contained and that existence outside economic reach is respected and
preserved. Whereas other studies of the environment within the
framework of conventional neoclassical economics attempt to price
nature in a way that its value is assured, ecological economists work
from the conviction that such an approach is questionable if not
futile, as it can never achieve any accurate and reliable market values
for such existence.<small><span

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html">How the Railroads
Got Us On the Wrong Economic Track</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As recently as a century ago
classical economic thought still
regarded land for the most part as the common heritage of mankind.
From Adam Smith, through Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and finally
with John Stuart Mill <b>economic productivity was regarded as a
function of three interacting factors: land, labor, and capital.</b>
John Locke also accepted these premises. <b>To achieve optimal
economic productivity, one had to exact the appropriate price from
each of those factors. The price of labor was in wages; the price of
capital was interest; and the price of land, particularly following
the thinking of David Ricardo, was rent</b>. &nbsp; Rent in
its classical sense means payment for the use of something in fixed
supply, or, more generally, payments above the costs incurred for its
creation. <b><i>Disequilibriums and inefficiencies in economic
development resulted if the appropriate prices were not paid for each
factor. But, as we shall see, there were powerful interests in this
country, bent on not seeing any rent extracted from land use, that
persuaded the nascent economics profession at the end of the 19th
century no longer to regard land as a separate factor and to redefine
the terms of production instead in two-factor theory. This was
concurrent with the inclusion of land as property, since called "real
property." </i></b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>As land came to be transferred
to other nobility and usurped
under title in fee simple rather than in usufruct, it came to be
regarded as a private financial asset.</b> Earlier it was regarded as
part of nature, much like air, water, wind and weather. Accounting
practices now listed land as an asset "owned" in fee simple, and as a
liability on the other side of balance sheets in money "owed" to
banks. <b>This tendency has been extended today so that we have
privatized much of our air, water, wind, and even sunlight. Land came
to be simply one special kind of capital, nothing special, nothing
requiring further treatment</b>. Ricardo's Law of Rent became an
artifact of intellectual history. <b><i>The conflation of land into
capital to create two-factor economics is one of the greatest
paradigm shifts in the evolution of social philosophy</i></b>. How
the premises and terms of economic discourse have been changed has
been documented for the first time in a new book by a California
professor of economics, Mason Gaffney. The account is put forth in
fascinating detail entitled, <b><i><a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">The Corruption of
Economics</a></i></b>. It was indeed a corruption of a discipline, a
deliberate putsch by powerful economic forces with an interest in
seeing such definitions changed, and we have all been paying the
price since that time. This revealing thesis is what I really want to
relate to you, and to explain the dire consequences it has had for us
in our contemporary world. I have come to believe it; it makes sense
to me, both historically and in contemporary analysis, from several
perspectives.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Corruption of
Economics</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As I explained, classical
economics emerged from a school of
thinkers known as the Scottish moralists in the latter part of the
18th century. There ultimately evolved three major schools of
economic thought a century later,</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>one continuing tradition of Adam Smith through J.S. Mill,</small></li>
  <li><small>a second being the aggressive and emerging school of
Marxism, and</small></li>
  <li><small>the third a proposal for two-factor economics being
pressed
largely by interests in America.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marxism was never a major force in
United States; the primary
challenge to the classical tradition came from what has since come to
be known as neo-classical economics.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Gaffney has for the
first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly-established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged. What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America. By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The classical tradition of
economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age: Henry George. All
but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the assiduous
disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book, <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b></a>,
sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
travelled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and travelled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In classical economics, the
definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather thabeing returned
to society in rent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The failure of society to
recapture the appropriate level of land
rent from titleholders led also to depression of labor wages at the
margin, creating poverty and artificial scarcity of labor where
otherwise it could be relieved. Hence the title of George's book,
<b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></i></b>. George recognized that the value
of any land parcel arose out of its social activity, not from
anything which a titleholder might have done to it. He recognized
that many, perhaps most, titleholders in land were speculators,
reaping the benefit of others' investments, and selling out at last
when their price was met. Hence it made sense that society had a
right to a return on what it had brought about, as well as from the
fact that those titles could never be other than leaseholds. That
land rent, shortly confused by use of the words "single tax," was, to
George, the rightful return to society.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The railroad barons of the 19th
century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885.</b> The
actual intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got
appointed and promoted, who was funded in research, which were given
endowed chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation
with defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount
preoccupation of all of these figures. The central figures were:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President
of MIT
and Director of the Census Bureau.</small></li>
  <li><small>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of
economics
at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
own Institute with railroad money.</small></li>
  <li><small>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia
University,
and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
then Smith College.</small></li>
  <li><small>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at
Columbia
University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These figures are even today the
honored founders of an esteemed
profession. So great was their victory over rival schools of thought
that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear thinking and
virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten. The
lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, Friedman,
Harberger and now thousands of Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed,
when Henry George ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against
the wealthy patrician Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who
had recently recruited Clark to come to Columbia. To really
understand the academic tension of the period, one must look at the
published papers, the speeches and debates, the newspaper articles,
and the citations at the end of those articles. These, even more than
the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments, explain how
much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. Was it for the falsity
of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then have
managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather, it
was the threat George represented to powerful interests that required
him to be defeated, and in doing so they succeeded but only in the
short run, as they were within decades victims of their very
successes. Today we see that the railroads have failed in this

Walt Rybeck: <a
 href="../docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html">Have
We Forgotten The Foundation?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The land ethic and land
practices, which served our economy and cities
so well, sadly fell into disrepair. Here are five of the more important
reasons:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One: By 1900 the frontier
was
gone.</span>
The country was virtually all fenced in. Historian Frederick Jackson
Turner in the 1890s underscored the frontier's importance. Its free or
cheap land had been a safety valve for labor. Workers who felt
exploited could go West--strike out on their own.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Two: Prodigious
concentrations
of wealth materially altered the economic landscape. </span>Some
of these were based on railway land giveaways. Most were tied to
natural resource monopolies -- of coal, timber, oil, cattle lands and
so
forth -- whose owners found ways to fend off land taxes.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Three: A shift from local
to
federal power occurred in the political arena. </span>The
national government had to grow to save the Union and execute the Civil
War. It also expanded to combat abuses of giant combines and trusts. To
underwrite this growth, Congress turned primarily to tax-ing production
and incomes.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Four: At the urging of
land
monopolists who practically owned many state legislatures in the late
1800s, state governments discarded property taxes, replacing them with
income and sales taxes.</span> Local governments also gradually began
to decrease their reliance on property taxes.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Five: The property tax
itself
was transformed. It became less a tax on land values, increasingly a
tax on improvements--that is, on houses, stores, offices and other
edifices on the land.</span> These factors gave rise to slums, to
panics (as depressions were then called), and a widening gap between
the haves and have-nots. As a corrective, Henry George in his 1879
masterwork, <a href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/George_P&amp;P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>,
urged Americans to address the land problem. He inspired a large
popular following, but many academics, politicians, economists and
captains of industry asked scornfully, "What land problem?"</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It calls to mind the routine
where Jimmy Durante got caught steeling an
elephant from a circus. A cop says, "Hey, where 'ya going with that
elephant?" And Durante replies, "What elephant?" A century later, few
question that we have an elephantine land problem. </small></div>

  <li><small>Sprawl and crawl people know it.

  <li><small>Many elected officials, homebuyers, and people trying to
start a
farm or a business know it. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, too few have a clue
about how to deal with land issues, or any
notion that archeological digs into our history might provide useful
answers. Instead, consider what's happening:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Habitat volunteers build
houses
for the poor, making recipients
and its volunteers feel real good.</span> This is a fine example of
charity
combined with self-help, and it spreads awareness of a great social
ill. But more housing is being abandoned and demolished than Habitat is
able to build.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This same treadmill
effect
undermines federal efforts. </span>HUD has
spent billions on public housing, urban renewal and enterprise zones.
Some of these programs have retarded urban decline but their strongest
advocates would not claim they have come close to stopping or reversing
it.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cities offer tax
abatements to
revive decaying business
districts. </span>Yet after new buildings are established, the cities
hit
owners with the same tax burden that helped cause decay in the first
place.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some builders turn to
what I
call "designer sprawl." </span>They mimic
old towns and are clearly less wasteful of land than unplanned sprawl.
Yet they often invade wheat fields and wood lots far from the job
centers, transit lines and cultural institutions that comprise real
communities -- while large quantities of usable sites that are well
served by infrastructure lie fallow in those real cities and towns.
These stumbling efforts recall an architectural parallel -- when people
first tried rather pathetically to restore old neighborhoods with false
storefronts, tarpaper bricks and Permastone.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urbanologists and the public
need to be awakened to the central role
played by taxation. They need to see that loss of our historic land tax
has made speculation our top national sport -- a treacherous one at
that. ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

</a></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Applying a land fraction
derived from
residential data to commerce and industry is not believable. The land
share is highest in retailing, the more so now that retailing entails
vast parking areas.</span> Filling stations and and drive-ins of all
kinds entail vast aprons for small buildings with short lives. Some
retailers store their inventories outdoors: auto dealerships, lumber
yards, junk yards are examples. Many wholesalers and industries do the
same: tank farms, railroad yards, utility easements, industrial
reserves, dumps, drive ins, salt beds, terminals, heaps of coal and
salt and sulfur, and so on and on. In downtown Milwaukee, half the
assessed value is land. In Manhattan, it is instructive to consider the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Empire State Building</span>. If ever
a structure overdeveloped a site, the world's tallest building on a
fringe site should be it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet in two
transactions since 1950 the site was valued at one third the total. One
may infer what this implies of the whole island.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;
Anyone active in real estate would have caught Goldsmith&#8217;s error. Yet
it passed muster with the NBER, his publisher the Princeton University
Press, and several learned academic reviewers. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This is not a measure of
their general incompetence, but of the extent to which academicians
have walled themselves off from anything bearing on the realities of
land values and rents. Goldsmith treated land carelessly, as a trivial
side-issue, and his finding was ignored by everyone except those who
needed to invoke an authority to trivialize land value.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp;
Several published case studies document the higher ratio of land value
to building value in non-residential uses, and central cities. Here I
will merely list them.</small></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;On
the whole, Gaffney&#8217;s findings in Milwaukee bear out findings of the
other studies, although the Milwaukee patterns are more complex.
Goldsmith's transfer of the land share in a few new FHA residences to
all urban real estate is a momentous error that dominates his estimates
and destroys any value they might have.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another Goldsmith error is to
exclude subsoil assets.</span> In cities
overlying oil pools, like Huntington Beach, that would make a big
difference. In most cities that may not matter, but is symptomatic of
how insouciantly Goldsmith handled this whole matter of land values.

Adam Monroe's response to Lindy Davies: <a

Capitalism and Geoism</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Brilliant analysis. I'm not surprised folks have little to add! You
might have pointed out that while Marx's
first step for creating communism was to confiscate land's rental
value, this was also considered, by they who coined the term, the
primary necessity for establishing "laissez-faire."<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Even Adam Smith, the so-called
"father of capitalism" recommended the land tax.</span> <br>
<br>
These sorts of facts are so numerous, most of both Left and
Right-Wingers have either been shielded from the information or are
intentionally misleading folks.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
Education and media companies, the very institutions one would normally
consider responsible for informing the public of such a scandalous
affair, are owned by land speculators.</span> No wonder the public
believes politics and economics are about labor vs. capital. <br>
<br>
The degree to which control of "the news" determines public perception
is apparent in Serbia right now. This is why so many people there think
their leader is an OK guy.</small>...<big><span
