<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;"></div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="left">Were America to ever gather the
      political will to pay reparations to all who could prove themselves to
      be the descendant of at least one enslaved
        person, under our current system (some would describe it as &quot;land monopoly
        capitalism,&quot; the bulk of the benefit of those reparations would
        fall, not to the descendants of enslaved persons, but to those who owned
        land
        or houses
        or rental properties around the time that those reparations were paid.
        Twenty years later, we'd find that it was <em>their</em> children whose college
        attendance had been increased, and their retirement portfolios which had
        been inflated. After 20 years, those who had received reparations would be
        only slightly better off than they had been before the vote to pay reparations.
        And those whose economic situations before reparations were fairly similar
        to those of the recipients (and their children), but who did not receive
        reparations, would be worse off, because in the years following the payments,
        they would
        have
        had
        to compete for housing with those who had more to spend, and housing costs
        would have been driven up significantly. The beneficiaries would be those
        who owned the best land, in proportion to the quality of their holdings.</p>
    <p align="left">Is this an argument against reparations? Not particularly.
      Rather, it is an argument that we first fix some of the most serious underlying
      problems, and then see how things sort themselves out, before making things
      worse for nearly everyone and enriching further the already rich! We might
      very well find that, with everyone starting from a position of economic justice
    and equality, many of the problems of poverty and racism would improve</p>

  Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
  of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If poverty is appointed by the power which
    is above us all, then it is no crime; but if poverty is unnecessary, then
    it is a crime for which society is responsible and for which society must
    suffer. I hold, and I think no one who looks at the facts can fail to see,
    that poverty is utterly unnecessary. It is not by the decree of the Almighty,
    but it is because of our own injustice, our own selfishness, our own ignorance,
    that this scourge, worse than any pestilence, ravages our civilisation, bringing
    want and suffering and degradation, destroying souls as well as bodies. Look
    over the world, in this heyday of nineteenth century civilisation. In every
    civilised country under the sun you will find men and women whose condition
    is worse than that of the savage: men and women and little children with
    whom the veriest savage could not afford to exchange. Even in this new city
    of yours with virgin soil around you, you have had this winter to institute
    a relief society. Your roads have been filled with tramps, fifteen, I am
    told, at one time taking shelter in a round-house here. As here, so everywhere;
    and poverty is deepest where wealth most abounds.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>What more unnatural than this? There is nothing in nature like this
  poverty which today curses us. We see rapine in nature; we see one species
  destroying another; but as a general thing animals do not feed on their own
  kind; and, wherever we see one kind enjoying plenty, all creatures of that
  kind share it. No man, I think, ever saw a herd of buffalo, of which a few
  were fat and the great majority lean. No man ever saw a flock of birds, of
  which two or three were swimming in grease and the others all skin and bone.
  Nor in savage life is there anything like the poverty that festers in our civilisation.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>In a rude state of society there are seasons of want, seasons when people
  starve; but they are seasons when the earth has refused to yield her increase,
  when the rain has not fallen from the heavens, or when the land has been swept
  by some foe &#8211; not when there is plenty. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">And yet the peculiar
  characteristic of this modern poverty of ours is that it is deepest where wealth
  most abounds.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Why, today, while over the civilised world there is so much distress,
  so much want, what is the cry that goes up? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What is the current explanation of the hard times?
  Overproduction! </span>There are so many clothes that men must go ragged, so
  much coal that in the bitter winters people have to shiver, such over-filled
  granaries that people actually die by starvation! Want due to over-production!
  Was a greater absurdity ever uttered? How can there be over-production till
all have enough? It is not over-production; it is unjust distribution.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We talk about over-production. How can
    there be such a thing as over-production while people want? All these things
    that are said to be over-produced are desired by many people. Why do they
    not get them? They do not get them because they have not the means to buy
    them; not that they do not want them. Why have not they the means to buy
    them? They earn too little. When the great masses of men have to work for
    an average of $1.40 a day, it is no wonder that great quantities of goods
    cannot be sold. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now why is it that men have to work for
    such low wages? Because if they were to demand higher wages there are plenty
    of unemployed men ready to step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed
    men who compel that fierce competition that drives wages down to the point
    of bare subsistence. Why is it that there are men who cannot get employment?
    Did you ever think what a strange thing it is that men cannot find employment?
    Adam had no difficulty in finding employment; neither had Robinson Crusoe;
    the finding of employment was the last thing that troubled them. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If men cannot find an employer, why cannot
    they employ themselves? Simply because they are shut out from the element
    on which human labour can alone be exerted. Men are compelled to compete
    with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been robbed
    of the natural opportunities of employing themselves; because they cannot
    find a piece of God's world on which to work without paving some other human
    creature for the privilege. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the Old Testament we are told that
    when the Israelites journeyed through the desert, they were hungered, and
    that God sent manna down out of the heavens. There was enough for all of
    them, and they all took it and were relieved. But supposing that desert had
    been held as private property, as the soil of Great Britain is held, as the
    soil even of our new States is being held; suppose that one of the Israelites
    had a square mile, and another one had twenty square miles, and another one
    had a hundred square miles, and the great majority of the Israelites did
    not have enough to set the soles of their feet upon, which they could call
    their own &#8212; what would become of the manna? What good would it have
    done to the majority? Not a whit. <strong>Though God had sent down manna
    enough for all, that manna would have been the property of the landholders;
    they would
    have employed some of the others perhaps, to gather it up into heaps for
    them, and would have sold it to their hungry brethren</strong>. Consider it; this
    purchase and sale of manna might have gone on until the majority of Israelites
    had given all they had, even to the clothes off their backs. What then? Then
    they would not have had anything left to buy manna with, and the consequences
    would have been that while they went hungry the manna would have lain in
    great heaps, and the landowners would have been complaining of the over-production
    of manna. There would have been a great harvest of manna and hungry people,
    just precisely the phenomenon that we see today.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Now go into the cities and what do you see! Why, you see even a lower
  depth of poverty; aye, if I would point out the worst of the evils of land
  monopoly I would not take you to Connemara; I would not take you to Skye or
  Kintire &#8212; I would take you to Dublin or Glasgow or London. There is something
  worse than physical deprivation, something worse than starvation; and that
  is the degradation of the mind, the death of the soul. That is what you will
  find in those cities.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Now, what is the cause of that? Why, it is plainly to be seen; the people
  driven off the land in the country are driven into the slums of the cities.
  For every man that is driven off the land the demand for the produce of the
  workmen of the cities is lessened; and the man himself with his wife and children,
  is forced among those workmen to compete upon any terms for a bare living and
  force wages down. Get work he must or starve &#8212; get work he must or do
  that which those people, so long as they maintain their manly feelings, dread
  more than death, go to the alms-houses. That is the reason, here as in Great
  Britain, that the cities are overcrowded. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open
  the land that is locked up, that is held by dogs in the manger, who will not
  use it themselves and will not allow anybody else to use it, and you would
  see no more of tramps and hear no more of over-production. </span>... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Every
form of
enterprise only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the
cream off for himself&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It does not matter where you
look or what examples you select, you will
see that every form of enterprise, every step in material progress, is
only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the cream off for
himself, and everywhere today the man or the public body who wishes to
put land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land
values to the man who is putting it to an inferior use, and in some
cases to no use at all. All comes back to the land value, and its owner
for the time being is able to levy his toll upon all other forms of
wealth and upon every form of industry. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A portion, in some cases the whole, of
every benefit which is laboriously acquired by the community is
represented in the land value</span>, and finds its way automatically
into the
landlord's pocket. If there is a rise in wages, rents are able
to move forward, because the workers can afford to pay a little more.
If the opening of a new railway or a new tramway or the institution of
an improved service of workmen's trains or a lowering of fares or a new
invention or any other public convenience affords a benefit to the
workers in any particular district, it becomes easier for them to live,
and<span style="font-weight: bold;"> therefore the landlord and the
ground landlord, one on top of the
other, are able to charge them more for the privilege of living there. </span>...

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_ABOER.html">A Bill of
Economic Rights and Obligations</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...&nbsp; </small><small>While
the bill of economic rights and obligations does not address
the issue explicitly, it should be understood that people have a
right to redress for past injustice, no matter how far back in the
past. If some persons have inferior starting positions because they
are the descendants of slaves who, because of that status, were
unable to provide what others provided to their children, then there
should be a levy on the property of the descendants of slave-owners
to rectify that injustice.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In fulfilling its obligation to
ensure that future generations had
opportunities at least as great as those of the present generation,
people would want to take account of:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1. The amount of land per
capita, adjusted for the quality of land;<br>
2. The level of technology that will be available;<br>
3. The education and any initial wealth that is provided to all
children;<br>
4. The level of public infrastructure;<br>
5. The level of public debt;<br>
6. Environmental quality;<br>
7. The price of depletable natural resources.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Decreases in some items could be
offset by increases in others. If
people wanted to have more children than could be provided with
opportunities equal to those of the present generation, Congress and
state legislatures would have an obligation to tax those who wanted
to have children, so that people would have fewer children, and so
that all children could be provided with an initial endowment upon
attaining maturity, to compensate for reductions in other items on
the list.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_ABOER.html"><span
