  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>II. What is
waste, and what should we do about it?</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We are all against wasting
resources: wonderful - but what is
waste? In answering, I will deal with two cognate questions.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We agree, we should combat waste with a family of green
taxes,
but what green taxes? When, and where, and why?</small></li>
  <li><small>We agree on containing sprawl, but should we stress
repelling
people from designated green areas, or attracting them to designated
human habitats?</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A. What is waste?</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The question has been faced
before. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gifford
Pinchot</span> was a leader
with a magic name in the U.S.A. during the early conservation era. He
answered well for his times and, I submit, for ours too.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>"... natural resources must be developed and
preserved
for the benefit of the many and not merely for the profit of a few. ...
the people shall get their fair share of the benefit which comes from
the development of the country which belongs to us all."</small></blockquote>
  <small> </small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He did not say just "preserved;"
he said "developed and
preserved." Today I suspect he would say "REdevelop," to get away
from the negative baggage carried by "develop;" I certainly will.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Pinchot went on:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small>"The first principle of conservation is
development, the
use of the natural resources now existing ... for the benefit of the
people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting
the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in
their destruction by waste. ... Conservation, then, stands emphatically
for the use of substitutes (he mentions water for power and
transportation) for all the exhaustible natural resources, ... The
development of our natural resources and the fullest use of them for
the present generation is the first duty of this generation. ... </small>
    <p><small>In the second place conservation stands for the
prevention of
waste. ... "</small></p>
    <small> </small></blockquote>
  <small> </small></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So Pinchot was against waste,
like everyone, but he gives it a new
turn (or, rather, an old turn that many have forgotten). <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To him,
WASTE MEANS FAILING TO USE RENEWABLE RESOURCES</span>. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Urban land makes
a
good example. Urban land, economically speaking, is a lot like
falling water, strange as it seems. Economists (who are not all bad)
classify urban land as a "flow resource." </span>They liken it to
flowing
water because its services perish with time, whether used or not -
and we are trapped in the one-way flow of time. It is an even better
example of a "flow resource" than water itself, because unused water
may have other uses downstream. Even in wasting out through
California's Golden Gate, fresh water repels salinity. The unreaped
harvests of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the
Golden Gate of time like lost loves, and magic moments that passed us
by. The waste of NOT using flow resources is just as real as the
waste of misusing exhaustible resources. Indeed, when we tote up the
transportation costs of disintegrated urban settlement patterns, it
is clear that failure to use good urban land is a major cause of
wasting energy.&nbsp; ... <a

Support of Environmentalism</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><small><small><b>Gifford
Pinchot's Winning Formula</b></small></small></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A. Defining
"Conservation"</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Gifford Pinchot was a great leader
of the Conservation Movement.
He defined his central term, conservation, as "The greatest good for
the greatest number for the longest time." Caviling theorists
sometimes pick at that famous phrase, since you cannot maximize three
things at the same time, but that is unfair, since he was not being
technical. He was making a speech, and obviously what he meant was
that those three elements should all be considered, and none was to
be slighted.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Notice especially the middle
clause, for the greatest number.
Conservation was not just for landowners, or any other elite.
Conservation was part of the Progressive Movement, which had sprung
from the Populist Movement. Social equity was at its core. Here is
some more of Pinchot's speech (to the 1st National Conservation
Congress, 1909):</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the third principle
of conservation. It is this: the natural resources must be developed
and preserved for the benefit of the many and not merely for the profit
of a few</span>. ... public action for public benefit has ... a much
larger part to play than was the case ... before certain constitutional
arrangements ... had given so tremendously strong a position to vested
rights and property in general. ... by reason of the 14th Amendment to
The Constitution, property rights in the U.S. occupy a stronger
position than in any other country in the civilized world. ... it
becomes then a matter of multiplied importance, ... when property
rights once granted are so strongly entrenched, that they shall be
granted only under such conditions as that the people shall get their
fair share of the benefit which comes from the development of the
country which belongs to us all. The time to do that is now.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You modern habitat-savers, your
foes score points against you by
calling you "elitists." Sure enough, you do appear a bit above, and
therefore outside the mainstream, especially when you talk down to
people from the eminence of "Science." Pinchot saw that brick coming
and dodged it before it was even thrown. He teamed up with the
populists; he spoke as a man for the people, even if not quite of
them. Can you say the same? Is there a place in your plans, and your
hearts, for Joe Sixpack?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a list that the Southern
California Association of
Governments (SCAG) has published from its recent public opinion
survey of public issues. Preserving habitat and endangered species
are not even among the top 17 priorities listed by citizens. Neither
are private property rights. Their top three concerns are crime,
education, and jobs. Politicians have preempted the crime issue, but
no one is doing a thing this year for education and jobs. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Take a leaf
from the successful Gifford Pinchot: team up with some populists.
Move into the vacuum left behind the gale of anti-crime oratory. No
one is serving the constituency for education and jobs.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Other populist issues high on the
SCAG list are homelessness,
affordable housing, job training, and child care.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>B. Finding common
ground</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On what basis shall habitat-savers
identify with median Americans?
We share a problem: we are all victims of private property rights
carried to extremes. Abraham Lincoln, the original Radical
Republican, once spoke to the effect that whenever landless people
cannot find work and shelter, then the rights of private property
have been carried too far and must be curbed. We have seen what
Gifford Pinchot said.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>"... natural resources
must be developed and preserved
for the benefit of the many and not merely for the profit of a few. ...
the people shall get their fair share of the benefit which comes from
the development of the country WHICH BELONGS TO US ALL." </i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Belongs to us all? Was Pinchot a
Communist? Not likely: he was a
Republican, an active political one, twice Governor of
Pennsylvania.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have too little time together
to develop that fully, but here
are some ideas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">First,
environmentalists might rethink what we mean
by "open space." To Pinchot, "open" meant the space had public
access. Today it often means the reverse: golf courses, duck clubs,
sacred Indian lands, private beaches, cemeteries, farmlands, vacant
speculative holdings, unpoliced parks taken over by gangs, protected
and posted habitat, water from which swimmers are excluded for power
boats, rights-of-way closed to hikers, University experimental plots,
and so on.</span> In this sense, there is more open land in downtown
Manhattan than in many of our rural and sylvan areas. Many a water
reservoir is open to beavers, ducks and geese, who routinely powder
their noses there, but not to humans who seldom do, and can be
trained not to.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get more support for habitat,
find ways to open it to people,
putting more funds and effort into behavioral controls if necessary.
In Pinchot's day, people spoke unblushingly of "character training,"
and practiced it. Pinchot himself said, "the training of our people
in citizenship is as germane to it (conservation) as the
productiveness of the earth." Wilderness clubs preached and taught
responsible behavior in the wilds. The Boy Scouts taught it, churches
taught it, schools taught it, forest rangers taught it, camp
counselors taught it, community leaders taught it: you heard it all
around, and it did help shape your character. It was a great
community effort, enlisting broad support and conviction. Then, in
that less mobile, less commercialized, more communitarian age, social
control over public behavior came naturally. We came to take it for
granted, until it silently slipped away. Today it may take more
conscious effort, but it was done then, it can be done now.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Second, go with the flow for
economy in government.</span> For most of
our lives now, we have looked to big government to resolve disputes
by buying out both parties. We would have government pay top dollar
for land, if needed, and then hire scientists to manage it for
habitat. Thus, both sides dream of cutting into line at the
government trough: but the trough is empty, and the taxpaying public
is in a foul mood. Rather, let's look for ways to cut spending by
curbing subsidies to urban sprawl. I shall return with
particulars.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><b>IV.
Pinchot on "Development"</b></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Gifford Pinchot, the father of
Conservation, was not against
developing land. In his own words:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"The first principle of
conservation is development, the
use of the natural resources now existing ... for the benefit of the
people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting
the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in
their destruction by waste. ... Conservation, then, stands emphatically
for the use of substitutes for all the exhaustible natural resources,
... (water power and water transportation are his examples). ... The
development of our natural resources and the fullest use of them for
the present generation is the first duty of this generation. ... </small>
  <p><small>In the second place conservation stands for the prevention
of
waste. ... "</small></p>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So Pinchot was against waste, so
what? Who isn't? This could be
just a banality, but he gives it a new turn. To him, waste means
failing to use renewable resources. His example was hydropower, which
he would substitute for coal and oil. That is not such a good example
today, when we cherish our few remaining wild rivers, but today urban
land makes an even better example.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Urban land?", you may ask. "What
has urban land in common with
falling water?" Economists (who are not all bad) classify urban land
as a "flow resource." They liken it to flowing water because its
services perish with time, whether used or not, and we are trapped in
the one-way flow of time. Likewise, urban land is not depleted by
use. It is an even better example of a "flow resource" than flowing
water itself, because, as we are so conscious today, "unharnessed"
flowing water may have other downstream uses. Even in wasting out
through the Golden Gate, it may repel salinity. The unreaped harvests
of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the gates of time
like lost loves dimming, and golden moments we let slip away beyond
recall.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is this "service" of urban
land, that we should be mindful of
it? 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small>For one thing, using central urban land conserves all
the
hydrocarbons and other resources otherwise needed to traverse it.
Compact urban settlement is a direct substitute for oil, with all
that implies - and it implies a great deal, which I will leave you to
fill in.</small></li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Second, using good central
land saves all the costs of settling
on
other land - including the cost of taking more of the shrinking
habitat from endangered species. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore,
habitat-savers should
emulate Pinchot and favor development in the right places, the better
to oppose it in the wrong places. This is the great lost secret of
conservation our times have forgot. </span>You cannot beat development
by
opposing it everywhere it pops up. People need land for all kinds of
legitimate things, and they will have it. To stop urban sprawl, you
must support compact, efficient urban development, including healthy,
timely renewal of older cities, inner suburbs, and neighborhoods.

    History of Pennsylvania</a>, by Phillip S. Klein and Ari Hoogenboom, p. 441</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>More than any other person, Gifford Pinchot dominated Pennsylvania in the
      1920s and early 1930s. Serving as governor from 1923 to 1927 and from 1932
      to 1935, Pinchot gave Pennsylvania a progressive administration during
    the reactionary 1920s. Pinchot was born in Connecticut, but his family came
    from
      Milford, where his grandfather had settled and prospered. His father made
    a fortune as a New York merchant, married the daughter of millionaire New
    Yorker
      Amos R. Eno, and built the family mansion Grey Towers just outside Milford.
      Pinchot was committed to public service. &quot;My own money,&quot; he remarked in
    1914, &quot;came from the unearned increment on land in New York held by my grandfather,
      who willed the money, not the land, to me. Having got my wages in advance
    that
      way, I am now trying to work them out.&quot; ... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeff Smith: <a href="../../docs/Smith_SEP.html">How Sharing Earth Brought Peace</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Early last century, Gifford Pinchot, first head of the US Forest
  Service, said: "The earth belongs of right to all its people and not to a minority,
  insignificant in numbers but tremendous in wealth and power. The people shall
  get their fair share of the benefit which comes from the development of the country
  which belongs to us all with equal opportunity for all and special privileges
  for none." A man in a Republican administration could say that then. We need
  to
  hear it again now. ... <a href="../../docs/Smith_SEP.html">read the whole article </a></p>
