    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended for social
    needs is shown by the final proof. God is indeed a jealous God in the sense
    that nothing but injury and disaster can attend the effort of men to do things
    other than in the way he has intended; in the sense that where the blessings
    he proffers to men are refused or misused they turn to evils that scourge
    us. And just as for the mother to withhold the provision that fills her breast
    with the birth of the child is to endanger physical health, so for society
    to refuse to take for social uses the provision intended for them is to breed
    social disease.</p>
  <p>For refusal to take for public purposes the increasing values that attach
    to land with social growth is to necessitate the getting of public revenues
    by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution and corrupt society.
    It is to leave some to take what justly belongs to all; it is to forego the
    only means by which it is possible in an advanced civilization to combine
    the security of possession that is necessary to improvement with the equality
    of natural opportunity that is the most important of all natural rights.
    It is thus at the basis of all social life to set up an unjust inequality
    between man and man, compelling some to pay others for the privilege of living,
    for the chance of working, for the advantages of civilization, for the gifts
    of their God. But it is even more than this. The very robbery that the masses
    of men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery.
    For the value that with the increase of population and social advance attaches
    to land being suffered to go to individuals who have secured ownership of
    the land, it prompts to a forestalling of and speculation in land wherever
    there is any prospect of advancing population or of coming improvement, thus
    producing an artificial scarcity of the natural elements of life and labor,
    and a strangulation of production that shows itself in recurring spasms of
    industrial depression as disastrous to the world as destructive wars. It
    is this that is driving men from the old countries to the new countries,
    only to bring there the same curses. It is this that causes our material
    advance not merely to fail to improve the condition of the mere worker, but
    to make the condition of large classes positively worse. It is this that
    in our richest Christian countries is giving us a large population whose
    lives are harder, more hopeless, more degraded than those of the veriest
    savages. It is this that leads so many men to think that God is a bungler
    and is constantly bringing more people into his world than he has made provision
    for; or that there is no God, and that belief in him is a superstition which
    the facts of life and the advance of science are dispelling.</p>
  <p>The darkness in light, the weakness in strength, the poverty amid wealth,
    the seething discontent foreboding civil strife, that characterize our civilization
    of today, are the natural, the inevitable results of our rejection of God&#8217;s
    beneficence, of our ignoring of his intent. Were we on the other hand to
    follow his clear, simple rule of right, leaving scrupulously to the individual
    all that individual labor produces, and taking for the community the value
    that attaches to land by the growth of the community itself, not merely could
    evil modes of raising public revenues be dispensed with, but all men would
    be placed on an equal level of opportunity with regard to the bounty of their
    Creator, on an equal level of opportunity to exert their labor and to enjoy
    its fruits. And then, without drastic or restrictive measures the forestalling
    of land would cease. For then the possession of land would mean only security
    for the permanence of its use, and there would be no object for any one to
    get land or to keep land except for use; nor would his possession of better
    land than others had confer any unjust advantage on him, or unjust deprivation
    on them, since the equivalent of the advantage would be taken by the state
    for the benefit of all.</p>
  <p><a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">The Right Reverend Dr. Thomas Nulty</a>, Bishop of Meath, who sees all this
    as clearly as we do, in pointing out to the clergy and laity of his diocese*
    the design of Divine Providence that the rent of land should be taken for
    the community, says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I think, therefore, that I may fairly infer, on the strength of authority
        as well as of reason, that the people are and always must be the real owners
        of the land of their country. This great social fact appears to me to be
        of incalculable importance, and it is fortunate, indeed, that on the strictest
        principles of justice it is not clouded even by a shadow of uncertainty or
        doubt. There is, moreover, a charm and a peculiar beauty in the clearness
        with which it reveals the wisdom and the benevolence of the designs of Providence
        in the admirable provision he has made for the wants and the necessities
        of that state of social existence of which he is author, and in which the
        very instincts of nature tell us we are to spend our lives. A vast public
        property, a great national fund, has been placed under the dominion and at
        the disposal of the nation to supply itself abundantly with resources necessary
        to liquidate the expenses of its government, the administration of its laws
        and the education of its youth, and to enable it to provide for the suitable
        sustentation and support of its criminal and pauper population. One of the
        most interesting peculiarities of this property is that its value is never
        stationary; it is constantly progressive and increasing in a direct ratio
        to the growth of the population, and the very causes thatincrease and multiply
        the demands made on it increase proportionately its ability to meet them.<br>
        * <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Letter</a> addressed to the Clergy and Laity of the Diocese of Meath, Ireland,
        April 2, 1881.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is, indeed, as Bishop Nulty says, a peculiar beauty in the clearness
    with which the wisdom and benevolence of Providence are revealed in this
    great social fact, the provision made for the common needs of society in
    what economists call the law of rent. Of all the evidence that natural religion
    gives, it is this that most clearly shows the existence of a beneficent God,
    and most conclusively silences the doubts that in our days lead so many to
    materialism.</p>
  <p><strong>For in this beautiful provision made by natural law for the social
      needs of civilization we see that God has intended civilization</strong>; that all our discoveries
    and inventions do not and cannot outrun his forethought, and that steam,
    electricity and labor-saving appliances only make the great moral laws clearer
    and more important. In the growth of this great fund, increasing with social
    advance &#8212; a fund that accrues from the growth of the community and
    belongs therefore to the community &#8212; we see not only that there is
    no need for the taxes that lessen wealth, that engender corruption, that
    promote inequality and teach men to deny the gospel; but that to take this
    fund for the purpose for which it was evidently intended would in the highest
    civilization secure to all the equal enjoyment of God&#8217;s bounty, the
    abundant opportunity to satisfy their wants, and would provide amply for
    every legitimate need of the state. We see that God in his dealings with
    men has not been a bungler or a niggard; that he has not brought too many
    men into the world; that he has not neglected abundantly to supply them;
    that he has not intended that bitter competition of the masses for a mere
    animal existence and that monstrous aggregation of wealth which characterize
    our civilization; but that these evils which lead so many to say there is
    no God, or yet more impiously to say that they are of God&#8217;s ordering,
    are due to our denial of his moral law. We see that the law of justice, the
    law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection, but indeed the
    law of social life. We see that if we were only to observe it there would
    be work for all, leisure for all, abundance for all; and that civilization
    would tend to give to the poorest not only necessities, but all comforts
    and reasonable luxuries as well. We see that Christ was not a mere dreamer
    when he told men that if they would seek the kingdom of God and its right-doing
    they might no more worry about material things than do the lilies of the
    field about their raiment; but that he was only declaring what political
    economy in the light of modern discovery shows to be a sober truth.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness, even to see this is deep and lasting joy. For it is to see
    for one&#8217;s self that there is a God who lives and reigns, and that he
    is a God of justice and love &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven. It is
    to open a rift of sunlight through the clouds of our darker questionings,
    and to make the faith that trusts where it cannot see a living thing. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Civilization that is
Possible.</b>
</small><br>
<small>IN the effects upon the distribution of wealth, of making land
private property, we may thus see an explanation of that paradox
presented by modern progress. The perplexing phenomena of deepening
want with increasing wealth, of labor rendered more dependent and
helpless by the very introduction of labor-saving machinery, are the
inevitable result of natural laws as fixed and certain as the law of
gravitation. Private property in land is the primary cause of the
monstrous inequalities which are developing in modern society. It is
this, and not any miscalculation of Nature in bringing into the world
more mouths than she can feed, that gives rise to that tendency of
wages to a minimum &#8211; that "iron law of wages," as the Germans call
it -- that, in spite of all advances in productive power, compels the
laboring-classes to the least return on which they will consent to
live. It is this that produces all those phenomena that are so often
attributed to the conflict of labor and capital. It is this that
condemns Irish peasants to rags and hunger, that produces the
pauperism of England and the tramps of America. It is this that makes
the almshouse and the penitentiary the marks of what we call high
civilization; that in the midst of schools and churches degrades and
brutalizes men, crushes the sweetness out of womanhood and the joy
out of childhood. It is this that makes lives that might be a
blessing a pain and a curse, and every year drives more and more to
seek unbidden refuge in the gates of death. For, a permanent tendency
to inequality once set up, all the forces of progress tend to greater
and greater inequality.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All this is contrary to Nature.
The poverty and misery, the vice
and degradation, that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth,
are not the results of natural law; they spring from our defiance of
natural law. They are the fruits of our refusal to obey the supreme
law of justice. It is because we rob the child of his birthright;
because we make the bounty which the Creator intended for all the
exclusive property of some, that these things come upon us, and,
though advancing and advancing, we chase but the mirage. ... <span

  <p><br>
THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only
  upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon
  them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community,
  for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community.
  It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent
  is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality
  ordained by nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage over any
  other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence; and
  each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor
  get its full reward, and capital its natural return. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

HERE is a provision made by natural law for the increasing needs of social growth;
here is an adaptation of nature by virtue of which the natural progress of society
is a progress toward equality not toward inequality; a centripetal force tending
to unity growing out of and ever balancing a centrifugal force tending to diversity.
Here is a fund belonging to society as a whole, from which without the degradation
of alms, private or public, provision can be made for the weak, the helpless,
the aged; from which provision can be made for the common wants of all as a matter
of common right to each. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp19.html">Social

  <p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land values as
    the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British traditions. A
    land tax of four shillings in the pound of rental value is still nominally
    enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation made in the reign of
    William III, it amounts in reality to not much over a penny in the pound.
    With the abolition of indirect taxation this is the tax to which men would
    naturally turn. The resistance of landholders would bring up the question
    of title, and thus any movement which went so far as to propose the substitution
    of direct for indirect taxation must inevitably end in a demand for the restoration
    to the British people of their birthright. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free

          <br>
  THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the natural
  result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among whom equality and
  individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized, in theory at least, that
  the land belongs to society at large, not to the individual. Rude outcome of
  an age in which might stood for right as nearly as it ever can (for the idea
  of right is ineradicable from the human mind, and must in some shape show itself
  even in the association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted
  in no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was essentially
  a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The sovereign, theoretically
  the representative of the collective power and rights of the whole people,
  was in feudal view the only absolute owner of land. And though land was granted
  to individual possession, yet in its possession were involved duties, by which
  the enjoyer of its revenues was supposed to render back to the commonwealth
  an equivalent for the benefits which from the delegation of the common right
  he received. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book
  VII, Chapter 4, Justice of the Remedy: Private Property in Land Historically
  Considered</a></p>
  <p>THE abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long Parliament,
    ratified after the accession of Charles II, though simply an appropriation
    of public revenues by the feudal landowners, who thus got rid of the consideration
    on which they held the common property of the nation, and saddled it on the
    people at large in the taxation of all consumers, has been long characterized,
    and is still held up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom.
    Yet here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England.
    Had the form of these feudal dues been simply changed into one better adapted
    to the changed times, English wars need never have occasioned the incurring
    of debt to the amount of a single pound, and the labor and capital of England
    need not have been taxed a single farthing for the maintenance of a military
    establishment. All this would have come from rent, which the landholders
    since that time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from the tax which
    land ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital. The landholders
    of England got their land on terms which required them even in the sparse
    population of Norman days to put in the field, upon call, sixty thousand
    perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further condition of various fines
    and incidents which amounted to a considerable part of the rent. It would
    probably be a low estimate to put the pecuniary value of these various services
    and dues at one-half the rental value of the land. Had the landholders been
    kept to this contract and no land been permitted to be inclosed except upon
    similar terms, the income accruing to the nation from English land would
    today be greater by many millions than the entire public revenues of the
    United Kingdom. England today might have enjoyed absolute free trade. There
    need not have been a customs duty, an excise, license or income tax, yet
    all the present expenditures could be met, and a large surplus remain to
    be devoted to any purpose which would conduce to the comfort or well-being
    of the whole people. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><a

  <br>
  <small> Often &#8220;justice&#8221; is interpreted in a very narrow legal sense

  <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span> Any society
  built on a basis of injustice will be burdened down with its own predisposition
  towards self-destruction. Even the most suppressed people will one-day, demand
  justice, rise up and overthrow their oppressors.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> Human survival demands justice. Wherever slavery or dictatorship has
  been installed -- eventually, justice has triumphed and a more democratic and
  fairer system has replaced it. It is safe to predict that wherever slavery
  or dictatorship exists today -- it will be superseded by a fairer and more
  just system.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> Similarly, let's
  consider our distribution of natural resources.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small> By definition, natural resources are not made by human effort. Our
  planet offers every inhabitant a bounty -- an amazing treasure chest of wealth
  that can supply our needs for food, shelter and every aspect for our survival.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> Surely, &#8220;justice&#8221; demands
  that this natural wealth should be equally available to all and that nobody
  should starve, be homeless or suffer poverty simply because they are excluded
  from tapping in to this enormous wealth that nature has provided. ...</span></small><br>

  <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> If our whole economy, with the
  private possession of land and other natural resources, is built upon an injustice
  -- then can any of us really be surprised that we continue to live on a planet
  where wars predominate, intolerance is common, crime is rife and where poverty
  and starvation is the norm for a huge percentage of earth's population.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small> Is this inherited system really the best we can do?</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> There must be a method for fairly utilising the earth's natural resources.</small><br>

  <small> Thus, Tony Blair recognises the difference between political justice
  in the form of a democratic Government and economic justice in the form of
  sharing natural resources.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> We have not heard any dissenting voice from this promise to share Iraq's
  natural oil wealth for all the people of Iraq to enjoy the benefits. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But
  if it is so obviously right and proper for the Iraqi people to share their
  natural wealth &#8211; why is it not the practice to do the same in all nations?</span></small><br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> No landowner can create land
  values. If this were the case, then an entrepreurial landowner in the Scottish
  Highlands would be able to create more value than an indolent landowner in
  the City of London.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> No, land values arise because of natural advantages (eg fertility for
  agricultural land or approximity to ports or harbours for commercial sites)
  or because of the efforts of the whole community -- past and present investment
  by both the public and private sectors, and the activities of individuals all
  give rise to land values. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why do we not advocate the sharing
  of these land values, which are as much a gift of nature and probably in most
  western economies are worth much more than Iraqi oil?</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small> One solution would be to introduce a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Location
  Benefit Levy</span>, where each site is valued, based on its optimum permitted
  use and a levy is applied &#8211; a similar method to Britain's commercial
  rates on buildings but based soley on the land value and ignoring the condition
  of the building.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> The outcome of this policy would be to give all citizens a share in
  the natural wealth of the nation. ...</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> It is an injustice that landowners can speculate on empty sites, denying
  their use for jobs or homes.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> It is an injustice that a factory owner can sack all their workers,
  smash the roof of their building to let in the rain and be rewarded with elimination
  of their rates bill.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> It is an injustice that the poorest residents pay the highest share
  of their incomes in Council Tax.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> It is an injustice that people are denied their share of the earth's
  resources.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> The Location Benefit Levy is a simple way to start addressing the world's
last great injustice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Judge Samuel Seabury: <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">An Address delivered
      upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
      We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
      which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
      men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
      contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed. ...</p>
  <p>The most serious threat to democracy which exists is that the democracies
      themselves have not as yet achieved social justice for their own people. If
      they would achieve it, they would have nothing to fear from the dictatorship
      states. In this country we have approximately eleven million unemployed and
      are now in the tenth year of an acute economic depression. We certainly cannot
      claim to have achieved social justice. True, we offer many advantages over
      what the despotisms offer, but in any country people will submit to regimentation
      and political and social despotism rather than go without food and shelter.
      In such circumstances, ignorant of the value of the liberty they surrender,
      they will sell their birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>
  <p>Instead of addressing ourselves seriously to the task of establishing social
      justice &#8212; the most momentous task which has ever confronted this country
      in all its history &#8212; we have wasted our energies and resources in
      adopting shallow and superficial measures not in harmony with the realities
      of social
      life and which ignore its natural laws; erecting great bureaucracies which
      have attempted to regiment our people, while the mass of regulations which
      they have prescribed have served only to demoralize industry, prevent its
      recovery and obstruct the cooperation between labor, capital and consumer
      which the
      interests of all require. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
  Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics 
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As with all nineteenth century
moral philosophers, Henry George
subscribed to a belief in natural law. The natural order of things as
he saw it required that land be held in usufruct and that rent from
such should be returned to society. The theory was inspired by his
deeply religious roots and grounded in his reading of the prominent
thinkers that predated him. The natural order was also a moral order,
and the failure to comply with the order of nature and society as he
saw it was a perversion of justice. The fruits of the land belonged to
everyone, just as the fruits of one&#8217;s own labor were uniquely one&#8217;s
own. Since one owned one&#8217;s body, one was entitled to keep the product
of one&#8217;s physical efforts. Society had no more right to confiscate the
earnings of one&#8217;s sweat and brow than it ought to leave in the hands of
rich landowners the rent that was everyone&#8217;s inherent birthright to be
shared. There were just and unjust
taxes, and the only just tax was that which grew out of rent, of the
unearned increment that visited certain land sites as windfall gains
because of the efforts and investments by the community. Income and
excise taxes were unjust and confiscatory&#8212; even theft, as especially
were tariffs. Taxing or collecting land rent alone was the means of
ending poverty and restoring progress. Indeed many Georgists reject use
of the word tax entirely, preferring instead to talk instead about rent
collection. There is even a lapel button Georgists use that says
&#8220;Abolish all taxes; collect ground rent instead.&#8221; ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ecological
Economics: Moral Premises<br>
</span>If Georgist economics takes a moral stance primarily focused on
justice, ecological economics makes a much wider sweep. From its
standpoint the very survival of the world is at stake, so that matters
of distributive justice, so central to Georgists, tend to get lost in
debate. Many ecological economists and environmental economists would
claim that theirs is not a moral stance at all; rather it is a simple
empirical reality. One philosopher writing in the journal Environmental
Ethics sets forth a view reflective of many:
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <p><small>I do wish to point out that this &#8216;holistic&#8217; view of the Earth&#8217;s
      ecological systems [i.e., the natural world as an organism] does not itself
      constitute a moral norm. It is a
  factual aspect of biological reality, to be understood as a set of
  causal connections in ordinary empirical terms.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">98</span></small></small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Living within the laws of
nature would seem to be axiomatic in the
development of any ethical system, and it is a mark of degree that our
ethics have so ignored such realities that a corrective is called for.
Only in 1967 Professor Lynn White noted in a now famous article how
much the Judeo-Christian tradition has been used to explain and justify
practices of exploitation and domination of our natural environment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">99</span></small>
Mistaken or not, this view of man&#8217;s place in nature is generally
accepted as conventional wisdom throughout western culture. The ecology
movement constitutes a revolutionary and very unsettling outlook to
this prevailing view, a radical shift in thinking from even mainstream
environmentalism and conservation ethics half a century ago. In this
view other species, both plants and animals, are as much entitled
to life and well being as is homo sapiens. Theodore Roosevelt a century
ago could never have subscribed to the views of contemporary
environmental ethicists, as much of a conservationist as he was. The
earliest clear manifestation of modern thinking at least in western
thought appears to be Aldo Leopold&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Sand
County Almanac</span>, a work only
published in 1949!<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">100</span></small>
Ecological economists
accept this so much as given&#8212; that human beings are of the earth and
its bio-system rather than on the earth to dominate it&#8212; that further
refinement of this basic orientation is almost beside the point. This
was simply prudent care and planning to Leopold; he fully recognized
our total dependence upon nature.... <a
