  Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp; (1887
  speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How do we know that the Almighty
is against poverty? That it is not in accordance with His decree that
poverty exists? We know it because we know this, that the Almighty has
declared: "Thou shalt not steal." And we know for a truth that the
poverty that exists today in the midst of abounding wealth is the
result of a system that legalizes theft.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The women who by the thousands are bending over their needles or
sewing machines, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day; these widows
straining and striving to bring up the little ones deprived of their
natural breadwinner; the children that are growing up in squalor and
wretchedness, underclothed, underfed, undereducated, even in this city,
without any place to play &#8212; growing up under conditions in which only a
miracle can keep them pure &#8212; under conditions which condemn them in
advance to the penitentiary or the brothel &#8212; they suffer, they die,
because we permit them to be robbed, robbed of their birthright, robbed
by a system which disinherits the vast majority of the children that
come into the world.</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is enough and to spare for them. Had they the equal rights
in the estate which their Creator has given them, there would be no
young girls forced to unwomanly toil to eke out a mere existence; no
widows finding it such a bitter, bitter struggle to put bread into the
mouths of their little children; no such misery and squalor as we may
see here in the greatest of American cities; misery and squalor that
are deepest in the largest and richest centers of our civilization
today.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">These things are the results of
legalized theft, the fruit of a denial of that commandment that says:
"Thou shalt not steal." How is this great commandment interpreted
today, even by men who preach the Gospel? "Thou shalt not steal." Well,
according to some of them, it means: "Thou shalt not get into the
penitentiary." Not much more than that with some. You may steal,
provided you steal enough, and you do not get caught. Do not steal a
few dollars &#8212; that may be dangerous, but if you steal millions and get
away with it, you become one of our first citizens.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">"Thou
shalt not steal"; that is the law of God. What does it mean? </span>Well,
it does not merely mean that you shall not pick pockets! It does not
merely mean that you shall not commit burglary or highway robbery! <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">There are other
forms of stealing which it prohibits as well. It certainly means (if it
has any meaning) that <span style="font-style: italic;">we shall not
take that to which we are not entitled, to the detriment of others.</span></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>Now, here is a desert. Here
is a caravan going along over the desert. Here is a gang of robbers.
They say: "Look! There is a rich caravan; let us go and rob it, kill
the men if necessary, take their goods from them, their camels and
horses, and walk off." But one of the robbers says:</small><br>
<br>
<small>"Oh, no; that is dangerous; besides, that would be stealing! Let
us, instead of doing that, go ahead to where there is a spring, the
only spring at which this caravan can get water in this desert. Let us
put a wall around it and call it ours, and when they come up we won&#8217;t
let them have any water until they have given us all the goods they
have." That would be more gentlemanly, more polite, and more
respectable; but would it not be theft all the same? And is it not
theft of the same kind when people go ahead in advance of population
and get land they have no use whatever for, and then, as people come
into the world and population increases, will not let this increasing
population use the land until they pay an exorbitant price?</small><br>
<br>
<small>That is the sort of theft on which our first families are
founded. Do that under the false code of morality which exists here
today and people will praise your forethought and your enterprise, and
will say you have made money because you are a very superior person,
and that all can make money if they will only work and be industrious!
But is it not as clearly a violation of the command: "Thou shalt not
steal," as taking the money out of a person&#8217;s pocket?</small><br>
<br>
<small>"Thou shalt not steal." That means, of course, that we ourselves
must not steal. But does it not also mean that we must not suffer
anybody else to steal if we can help it?</small><br>
<br>
<small>"Thou shalt not steal." Does it not also mean: "Thou shalt not
suffer thyself or anybody else to be stolen from?" If it does, then we,
all of us, rich and poor alike, are responsible for this social crime
that produces poverty. Not merely the people who monopolize the land &#8212;
they are not to blame above anyone else, but we who permit them to
monopolize land are also parties to the theft.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The Christianity that ignores this social responsibility has
really forgotten the teachings of Christ.&nbsp; <span

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As to the use of land, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by
    labor cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession.
    As your
      Holiness says, &#8220;God has not granted the earth to mankind in general in
      the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they please,&#8221; and
      regulations necessary for its best use may be fixed by human laws. But such
      regulations must conform to the moral law &#8212; must secure to all equal
      participation in the advantages of God&#8217;s general bounty. The principle
      is the same as where a human father leaves property equally to a number
      of children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable of common use
      or of
      specific division. Such things may properly be assigned to some of the
      children, but only under condition that the equality of benefit among them
      all be preserved.</p>
  <p>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing, and
      gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of land is
      not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend their labor
      in permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor is thus expended
      is needed to secure the right of property in the products of labor. For who
      would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed to enable him to
      reap? who would attach costly works to the soil without such exclusive possession
      of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</p>
  <p>This right of private possession in things created by God is however very
      different from the right of private ownership in things produced by labor.
      The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases when the dictate of
      self-preservation terminates all other rights. The purpose of the one, the
      exclusive possession of land, is merely to secure the other, the exclusive
      ownership of the products of labor; and it can never rightfully be carried
      so far as to impair or deny this. While any one may hold exclusive possession
      of land so far as it does not interfere with the equal rights of others, he
      can rightfully hold it no further.</p>
  <p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement
    divide the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive
    right
      to his share as against the other. But neither could rightfully continue
    such claim against the next man born. For since no one comes into the world
    without
      God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his equal right to the use
      of God&#8217;s bounty. For them to refuse him any use of the earth which
      they had divided between them would therefore be for them to commit <strong>murder. </strong>And for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for
      them or
      by giving them part of the products of his labor he bought it of them,
      would be for them to commit <strong>theft.</strong> ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

    Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge It</a> (1890)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To show briefly why we urge this
change, let me treat (1) of
<b><i>its expediency, </i></b>and (2) of <b><i>its
justice.</i></b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the Single Tax we may expect

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>Let us turn to the moral
side and consider the question of
<small><small><b>justice</b></small></small>.</small></small> ...</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The right of property does not
rest upon human laws; they have
often ignored and violated it. It rests on natural laws -- that is to
say, the law of God. It is clear and absolute, and every violation of
it, whether committed by a man or a nation, is a violation of the
command, "<font
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"
 color="#ff6600">Thou shalt not steal.</font>"</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The man who catches a fish,
grows an apple, raises a calf,
builds a house, makes a coat, paints a picture, constructs a machine,
has, as to any such thing, an exclusive right of ownership which
carries with it the right to give, to sell or bequeath that
thing</b>.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>But who made the earth that
any man can claim such ownership of
it, or any part of it, or the right to give, sell or bequeath it?</b>
Since the earth was not made by us, but is only a temporary dwelling
place on which one generation of men follow another; since we find
ourselves here, are manifestly here with equal permission of the
Creator, it is manifest that no one can have any exclusive right of
ownership in land, and that the rights of all men to land must be
equal and inalienable.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"
