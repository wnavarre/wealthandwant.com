Global Economic Justice</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>WOULD THERE be enough revenue for
the public sector? To address
this question, one should consider different types of public
activities separately. The type of public activity that can most
readily be financed by charges for exclusive access to natural
opportunities is local public services. When these are desired by
voters and provided efficiently, they tend to raise the rental value
of land by enough to pay for themselves, since a local public service
provides a benefit in a limited region, and people will bid up the
rental value of that land by the value of access to the
service.<font size="-2"><small><i>2 </i></small></font> Thus local
services can be
financed without even beginning to draw on the value of opportunities
provided by nature.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another broad area of public
spending is<span style="font-weight: bold;"> national defense</span>.
While
defense increases the value of land in a dangerous world, one might
reasonably hope that the need for defense spending would be greatly
reduced in a world that had adopted a general norm of acknowledging
the equal rights of all persons to natural opportunities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To the extent that defense costs
are raised when a nation becomes
a more attractive target-- because of increases in its stock of
capital or in the productivity of its citizens--it would be efficient
and not unreasonable to have an annual charge on capital and on
talent (an asset protection fee) to defray these costs. Such a fee
could be collected by a self-assessed tax. For capital, the tax
could be enforced by an obligation to sell the capital at the
self-assessed price. For talent, the tax could be enforced by a rule
that if a person was injured in an accident and wished to sue for
loss of earning power, the self-assessed value of the person's talent
would be the upper limit on the damages that could be claimed. It is
likely that a tax rate of two or three tenths of one percent per year
would suffice to fund the current level of U.S. defense spending. But I
would hope and expect that defense spending would fall
substantially. Between the reduced need for defense spending and an
efficient asset protection fee for the extra defense costs generated
by increases in capital and talent, it should be possible to finance
defense without exhausting the rental value of exclusive access to
natural opportunities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The next major area of government
spending to consider is <span style="font-weight: bold;">social
welfare programs-welfare, social security, unemployment compensation,
health insurance, etc.</span> These would tend to raise the rental
value of
land to some extent, but they would generally not raise land rents by
enough to pay for themselves, because their perceived value to
individuals tends to be highly disparate, so that those who value
access to such programs generally do not need to offer the full value
of such programs in rent premiums in order to get access to them. Thus
one cannot count on financing such programs by increases in
rent. The disparate value of public education to families makes this
public service subject to the same analysis.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Social welfare programs often have
an insurance component,
requiring payments by potential beneficiaries. If a program is so
close to a true insurance program that virtually everyone receives an
expected benefit that is as great as his or her assigned
contribution, then it can be financed by the assigned contributions,
and few will find the program objectionable. But social welfare
programs rarely approximate true insurance programs.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The difficulty with financing
social welfare programs with rent
arises because those who design such programs usually seek to require
some people to pay more than the expected value of their benefits. In a
world that recognizes the equal rights of all persons to natural
opportunities and the right of any person to emigrate, social welfare
programs of this sort will be possible only to the extent that they
reflect shared community values. If such a program draws on shared
feelings of community responsibility, then people will be happy to
contribute part of their shares of the value of natural
opportunities, or even part of their earnings to such programs. If
an attempt is made to implement social insurance that exceeds what
people are prepared to pay for out of a sense of community, people
will tend to emigrate or secede. Thus in a world that operates on
principles of global economic justice, people will not be required to
pay for social insurance that they object to. If people have
potential needs that exceed what their fellow citizens are willing to
provide, they will have to buy their own insurance before the need
arises or rely on friends and family. If those who are never able to
provide for themselves are to be provided for in a just world of
limited generosity, parents will need to buy insurance against having
children with special needs before they conceive those children. But
I believe that feelings of community are sufficiently extensive that
those who need help would receive it. Unlike the present situation,
in a just world every person would have a share of the value of
exclusive access to natural opportunities, which would provide a
guaranteed income that would provide for many contingencies....&nbsp; <a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An even greater share of the
federal budget is used for various
programs that provide help for people with special needs--welfare,
Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, unemployment insurance, disaster
assistance, etc. Some of these programs (social security, Medicare,
and unemployment compensation) are funded in part by payments by
prospective beneficiaries. But all incorporate substantial elements
of deliberate redistribution.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a world that adhered to a
classical liberal understanding of
justice, there would be three sources of funding for people with
special needs:</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1) insurance that those with
special needs had bought for
themselves prior to the onset of their special needs,</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>2) donations from family, friends
and other compassionate persons,
and</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>3) local public expenditures that
would be non-coercively
financed, because anyone who objected to the financing could leave
the locality.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a just would, people would
ensure, prior to conceiving
children, that any expensive special needs that their children might
have would be paid for, either by insurance that the parents would
buy, or by voluntary conventions in their communities that the
community would pay the costs of such needs.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Perhaps you object that some
people would not be able to afford
such insurance for all their children. If this is true, it implies
one of two things. 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Either the parents of such children are behaving
unjustly by conceiving those children, who will either lack what they
ought to have or will be able to receive it only by the imposition of
unjust taxes. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Or else the parents have been treated unjustly by
having started life without enough resources to provide for the
children that they ought to have had the chance to bring into the
world. I would guess that sometimes the first is true, sometimes the
second, and sometimes both.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
possibility that prospective parents might be unable to afford
to provide for the children that they ought to have the chance to
bring into the world highlights the possible need for a one-time
redistribution that would give everyone a fair starting point. </span>This
does not mean equality for ever. It does not necessarily even mean
equality at the starting time. What it means is allocating initial
rights in such a way that we do not mind requiring people to pay the
costs of their choices, including the choice of conceiving children
(unless they belong to communities that agree to pay the costs of
some of their choices).<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whenever a one-time
redistribution is proposed, a reaction of many
economists is, "Yeah, right. Why would anyone one believe that it
would be only one time?" What would make it reasonable to believe
that such a redistribution would be a one-time event is its
rationale: The recognition that some persons have had unfairly
inadequate starting positions in life, and the determination to end
that. If the purpose is achieved, there is no rationale for further
redistribution, unless, at some future time, our society attains a
new moral insight that implies that further redistribution is
required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small><span

<p>Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html">The Political Economy of the
Gospels</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>The message of the Gospels is that our sins are forgivable,
that
death is not to be feared because our true lives are spiritual rather
than physical, and that participation in the kingdom of God -- a new
and better life in this world as well as the next -- is accessible to
all who orient themselves to God.</small></p>
<p><small>Drawing on the Old Testament, Jesus taught that our first
commandment is that we love God with all our heart, and all our soul,
and all our mind, and all our strength, and that our second
commandment is that we love our neighbor as
ourselves.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>1</i></b></small></font> When
asked who our
neighbor is, he replied with the parable of the good Samaritan,
implying that anyone we encounter is our neighbor.
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font> Jesus taught an
ethic in which
there are no bounds on our obligations to others:&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... 
</span></span></small></p>
<p><small>When asked by Peter, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
against
me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" Jesus replied, "I say not
unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."&nbsp; In
other words, we are to
forgive indefinitely.</small></p>
<p><small>This unbounded obligation to others is reconciled with the
need to
survive through the introduction of the idea that it is not through
our own anxious efforts, but through God's provision for us that we
survive:<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<p><small>The message of the Gospels denies the validity of concern for
material scarcity. This is made particularly clear in the accounts of
the feeding of the multitudes with just a few loaves and
fishes.</small></p>
<p><small>comprehending this counterintuitive idea, that material
scarcity
is not to concern us, is brought out by the accounts of how even
Jesus' disciples did not understand the message:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... 
</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p><small>Without a concept of material scarcity it is difficult to
construct an economic theory, as material scarcity is central to
economic theory. And yet, even without a concept of material scarcity
there is an allocation problem to be solved--the allocation of our
efforts.</small></p>
<p><small>In the parable of the talents we are told that we will be
expected
to accomplish something with the resources that are put into our
hands. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>8</i></b></small></font> This
parable is
followed in Matthew by a teaching that may be taken as an indication
of what constitutes accomplishment:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... </i></b></small></font></small><small></small></p>
<p><small>In other words, every person is a manifestation of God, and
anything that we can do to help anyone is to our credit.</small></p>
<small>There is thus an unlimited task for each of us. No one of us
will
ever be able to say, "I have done every last thing that might be
required of me. I have no further obligations." But neither are we to
be concerned that that which we have left undone might be held
against us. For if we refrain from judging others, we ourselves will
not be judged:&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong><br>
</small>
<p><small>With this message of the Gospels in mind, turn now to the
problem
of political economy, the problem of what principles ought to govern
the organization of the production of goods and their
distribution.</small></p>
<p><small>One might first ask whether the requirement that we abandon
concern for scarcity would preclude production. The answer is no, it
is not production that we are cautioned to avoid, but anxiety. There
are any number of reasons why we might allocate some of our time to
production, without being anxious about our own material
requirements. We feel called to undertake a particular kind of work,
so we do it, trusting that any material needs we may have will be
satisfied. If we want to undertake our productive activities in
conjunction with others, that's fine, too. Associating with others
provides us with opportunities to be useful to them.</small></p>
<p><small>Among those who are close to us there is no need for prices
and
markets, because we can see easily enough how we can be of service to
them. But human discernment is limited, and prices and markets help
us to be aware of what is valued by people who are less close to
us.<strong> ... </strong></small><small></small></p>
<p><small>Refraining from the use of force is a recurring theme in the
political economy of the Gospels. We are called to refrain from the
use of force in defense of property. We are called to refrain from
the use of force in financing public activities. We are called to
refrain from the use of force in providing for those who might
otherwise lack. And we show our love for those who do not wish to
participate in our political economy by leaving for them the same per
capita value of land and natural resources that we claim for
ourselves.</small></p>
<p><small>Consider now how this framework bears on some traditional
questions of economic ethics. Take first the problem of the just
price. This simply is not an issue. If two people have the
opportunity to trade--to cooperate--on terms that are mutually
agreeable to the two of them, it is not for us to say that they ought
to be trading on other terms. Between people who love one another,
the problem of settling on the terms of trade is no more difficult
than the problem when friends eat lunch together of deciding who will
pick up the tab, or how it will be split.</small></p>
<small>That those outside a relationship are not called upon to
prescribe
its terms is supported by a passage from
Luke: <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
Relations between employers and employees are a special case of
relations between traders. <strong>... </strong><br>
The problem of worker management is not a problem either. <strong>... </strong><br>
</small>
<p><small>Corporate responsibility may be more of an issue for a
Gospel-based political economy. The corporate form of organization
permits us to participate in the establishment and management of
firms while knowing very little about the other people with whom we
are involved or the actions that are taken on our behalf. If this
leads us to support implicitly actions of managers in their concern
for the bottom line that we could not in good conscience take
ourselves, then there is something troubling about our participation
in corporations. We need to find ways of managing the resources under
our control that do not lead us to endorse implicitly and to profit
from actions that we would not endorse directly or take ourselves.
</small></p>
<p><small>The grand question of economic ethics, the question of
whether
capitalism or socialism is the more appropriate form of political
economy, is another non-question from the perspective of the Gospels.
Everyone who wants to live under socialism should be free to live
under socialism, and everyone who wants to live under capitalism
should be free to live under capitalism. In whichever group we fall,
we will want to insure that those who want to organize their lives by
different principles of political economy have their share of land
and natural resources with which to do so.</small></p>
<p><small>A political economy based on the Gospels is a political
economy
based on love. As the First Epistle of John says, "There is no fear
in love; but perfect love casteth out
fear."<font size="-1"><small><b><i>17</i></b></small></font> To
construct a
political economy of the Gospels we must be free of fear: free of
fear that others may rob us; free of fear that others may not
contribute to the provision of public goods or to provision for those
who might otherwise lack; free of fear that our incomes will be too
low or the prices we face too high; free of fear that if we don't do
something, someone will be exploited. Only when love has replaced all
fear in our hearts will we be able to construct the political economy
of the Gospels.</small> <small><a href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html"><span
