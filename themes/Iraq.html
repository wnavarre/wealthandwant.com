Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_land_for_the_people.html">The
Land for the People</a> (1889 speech)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE Land Question is not merely a
question between farmers and the
owners of agricultural land. It is a question that affects every man,
every woman, and every child. The Land Question is simply another
name for the great labor question, and the people who think of the
Land Question as having importance simply for farmers forget what
land is.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If you would realize what land is,
think of what men would be
without land. If there were no land, where would be the people? Land
is not merely a place to graze cows or sheep upon, to raise corn or
raise cabbage. It is the indispensable element necessary to the life
of every human being. We are all land animals; our very bodies come
from the land, and to the land they return again.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether a man dwells in the city
or in the country, whether he be
a farmer, a laborer, a mechanic, a manufacturer, or a soldier, land
is absolutely necessary to his life. No matter what his occupation
may by, if he is engaged in productive labor, that productive labor,
if you analyze it, is simply the application of human exertion to
land, the changing in place or in form of the matter of the
universe.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>WE speak of productive work.
What is productive work? We make
things. How do we make them? Man does not create them. Man cannot
create something out of nothing. All the things that we call making
are producing; bringing forth, not creating.
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Men produce coal by going down under the ground, hewing
out the
coal, and bringing it to the surface of the earth;</small></li>
  <li><small>they produce fish
by going to the lough, or river, or ocean and pulling the fish out; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>they produce houses by bringing together timber and stones
and
iron
into the shape and form of a house; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>they produce cloth by taking the
wool of a sheep or the fibers of a plant and bringing them together
in a certain connection; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>they produce crops by opening the ground and
putting in seed and leaving it there for the germinating influences
of nature</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>-- <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">always a bringing forth, never a
creation</span>, so that human
exertion -- that is to say labor upon land, is the only way that man
has of bringing forth those things which his needs require and which
are necessary to enable him to sustain life. Land and labor -- these
are the two necessary and indispensable factors to the production of
wealth.</small><br>
<br>
<small>NOW, as to the rights of ownership -- as to that principle which
enables a man to say of any certain thing --"This is mine; it is my
property" -- where does that come from? If you look you will see that
it comes from the right of the producer to the thing which he
produces. What a man makes he can justly claim to be his. Whatever
any individual, by the exercise of his powers, takes from the
reservoirs of nature, molds into shapes fitted to satisfy human
needs, that is his; to that a just and sacred right of property
attaches. That is a right based on the right of the individual to
improvement, the right to the enjoyment of his own powers, to the
possession of the fruits of his exertions. That is a sacred right, to
violate which is to violate the sacred command, "Thou shalt not
steal." There is the right of ownership. Now that right, which gives
by natural and Divine laws, the thing produced to him whose exertion
has produced it, which gives to the man who builds a house the right
to that house, to the man who raises a crop the right to that crop,
to the man who raises a domestic animal a right to that domestic
animal-how can that right attach to the reservoirs of nature? How can
that right attach to the earth itself? </small><br>
<br>
<small><b>WE start out with these two principles, which I think are
clear
and self-evident: </b></small><small><b></b></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>that which a man makes belongs to him and can by
him be given or sold to anyone that he pleases. 
    </b></small></li>
  <li><small><b>But that which existed
before man came upon the earth, that which was not produced by man,
but which was created by God -- that belongs equally to all men.&nbsp;</b></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As
no man made the land, so no man can claim a right of ownership in the
land. As God made the land, and as we know both from natural
perception and from revealed religion, that God the Creator is no
respecter of persons, that in His eyes all men are equal, so also do
we know that He made this earth equally for all the human creatures
that He has called to dwell upon it. We start out with this clear
principle that as all men are here by the equal permission of the
Creator, as they are all here under His laws equally requiring the
use of land, as they are all here with equal right to live, so they
are all here with equal right to the enjoyment of His bounty.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We claim that the land of Ireland,
like the land of every country,
cannot justly belong to any class, whether that class be large or
small; but that the land of Ireland, like the land of every other
country, justly belongs in usufruct to the whole people of that
country equally, and that no man and no class of men can have any
just right in the land that is not equally shared by all others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We say that all the social
difficulties we see here, all the
social difficulties that exist in England or Scotland, all the social
difficulties that are growing up in the United States-- 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the lowness
of wages, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the scarcity of employment, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the fact that though labor is
the producer of wealth, yet everywhere the laboring class is the poor
class</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>--are all due to one great
primary wrong, that wrong which makes
the natural element necessary to all, the natural element that was
made by the Creator for the use of all, the property of some of the
people, that great wrong that in every civilized country disinherited
the mass of men of the bounty of their Creator. What we aim at is not
the increase in the number of a privileged class, not making some
thousands of earth owners into some more thousands. No, no; what we
aim at is to secure the natural and God-given right to the humblest
in the community--to secure to every child born in Ireland, or in any
other country, his natural right to the equal use of his native
land. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><b>THESE are the plain, simple principles for which we contend,
and our practical measure for restoring to all men of any country
their equal rights in the land of that country is simply to abolish
other taxes, to put a tax upon the value of land, irrespective of the
improvements, to carry that tax up as fast as we can, until we absorb
the full value of the land, and we say that that would utterly
destroy the monopoly of land and create a fund for the benefit of the
entire community. </b>How easy a way that is to go from an unjust
situation like the present to an ideally just situation may be seen
among other things in this. Where you propose to take land for the
benefit of the whole people you are at once met by the demands of the
landlords for compensation. Now, if you tax them, no one ever heard
of such an idea as to compensate a people for imposing tax. </small><small><a

<p>Joseph Stiglitz: <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">October, 2002,
    interview</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Q: In <em>Globalization and its Discontents</em>, you write (p. 81): &quot;But land
    reform represents a fundamental change in the structure of society, one that
    those in the elite that populates the finance ministries, those with whom
    the international financial institutions interact, do not necessarily like.&quot;</p>
  <p>JES: Yes. Let me try to approach the question a little more systematically.
    Once you take the perspective I just gave, that means the management should
    be done in such a way that it maximizes the amount of money available to
    the US government from natural resources because they are within its domain
    and control. So, looking at the United States, one of the implications of
    this is that a foundation such as yours [the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation,
    created to promote the ideas of Henry George, as expressed in Progress &amp; Poverty]
    ought to be very much against the policies of the US government of giving
    away our natural resources. Here is a case where we not only are not taxing
    it much, we're actually giving it away.</p>
  <p>Q: I assume you're speaking in particular of oil and mineral rights, but
    would not Broadband Spectrum rights also be included in that category?</p>
  <p>JES: Yes, Broadband Spectrum rights as well. Now, giving away rights such
    as those would be anathema to the spirit of Henry George. And the second
    part is that when you sell them, you want to do so in such a way as to maximize
    the revenues. And whether you decide to sell it or whether you decide to
    rent it, would be the question of what is the way that maximizes the extraction
    of public revenues.</p>
  <p>Q: And those revenues go to the people. Not to private concerns.</p>
  <p>JES: Exactly. So you're trying to say, from the perspective of public management,
    how can we take this inelastic supply of public resources and maximize the
    rents that we can extract from it, consistent with other public objectives?
    That is a very deep philosophical approach, and requires a re-thinking of
    how we manage all aspects of those public resources. However, much of what
    we do is inconsistent with that. Now, the issue of land reform is a little
    bit different. There, it's a two-step analysis. My concern that I expressed
    about land is that in many developing countries, you have most land owned
    by a few rich people, and the land is relatively little taxed. But the land
    is worked in a system of sharecropping in which workers have to pay the landlord
    50% of their output. In a way, you can look at that 50% as a tax. The sharecroppers
    are paying a 50% tax to the landlord. But it's worse than a tax. Because
    it's not a land tax, it's a tax on their labor. And it's a tax that goes
    to the landlord rather than to society. So the notion is that land reform
    could take a variety of different forms. For instance, the government could
    take over the land and rent it to the people. Or give it to the people and
    have a land tax that would not have the distortionary effect of land reform.
    So, in a way, these systems of share-cropping are worse even than anything
    that Henry George was worried about in terms of misuse of land. ... <a href="../docs/Stiglitz_Oct02_interview.htm">read the entire interview</a></p>

<small>VII. Justice and the Demographic Equation</small><br>
<small>VIII. Conclusion</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Humanity is emerging from eons of
development during which
survival has been promoted both by the ability to grab resources from
others and by the ability of groups to cooperate and share natural
resources within communities that occupied territorial homelands. In
recent centuries we have been developing a consensus that taking from
the weak is wrong, and that we ought to have a social order that
prevents all such behavior. But we have not yet worked out how to do
it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some people think of preventing
grabbing in terms of preserving
the status quo. There are two difficulties with this.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, the status quo incorporates extensive holdings that
were acquired by indefensible means. A decision to preserve the status
quo commits us to defending the indefensible.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, there is no magic to any particular date, before
which unjust appropriations are incorporated into the status quo and
after which they are reversed.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A practice of allowing an
appropriation to be treated as just if
it has survived long enough gives aggressors an incentive to see if
they can grab and hold on long enough. The result is actions like
Indonesia's seizure of East Timor and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Only
if we have a standard of justice that is independent of history can
we expect to end such actions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George's theory of economic
justice--that every person has a
right to his or her productive powers, and that all persons have
equal rights to all natural opportunities--provides a simple formula
around which opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can
coalesce.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This may seem hopelessly
optimistic. But no other theory that I
have seen has anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this
theory.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>What to Do When
Some Nations Fail to Fulfill Their Obligations</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE THEORY that has been developed
incorporates all of the ways
that nations impinge upon one another by their appropriations of
natural opportunities-through their claims to land, natural
resources, the frequency spectrum, and geosynchronous orbits, through
their appropriations of fish in the ocean, through their use of
natural resources that are embedded in goods, through their emissions
of pollutants that cross international borders, including the ones
that produce global warming and ozone depletion, through their
decisions to have population growth rates that differ from the world
average, and in any other way that nations appropriate scarce natural
opportunities. The theory describes what nations must do to fulfill
their obligations to other nations. But how will unwilling nations
be compelled to fulfill their obligations if they do not wish to do
so?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The theory is not designed to
coerce recalcitrant nations. The
theory is designed to describe what must be done by those who wish to
fulfill their obligations. But universal acceptance is not needed
for the theory to work. In the first place, under the theory that
has been presented only some nations have obligations. The others
have claims. Until a careful analysis is done, it is not possible to
specify which nations have the obligations and which have the claims.
But only the nations with obligations need to be persuaded to
fulfill their obligations under the theory, and these are likely to
be predominantly rich nations. Because the magnitudes of transfers
to recipient nations depend on what those nations do, they receive
incentives to economize on their appropriations of natural
opportunities, even if they do not agree with the theory.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But suppose that only some of the
nations with net obligations are
willing to honor those obligations. How should these nations respond
to the lack of cooperation by others? </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, they should
compute their obligations as if the resources and populations of the
non-cooperating nations did not exist.</span> All persons have equal
rights to all natural opportunities. If some natural opportunities have
been improperly grabbed by people who refuse to acknowledge their
obligation to share, then those who do recognize their obligation
should understand that they must all claim less.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, the cooperating
nations should do what can reasonably be done to deny acceptability of
excessive claims to natural opportunities. If some nation appropriates
the oil, diamonds or other resources under the ground that it occupies
without regard to the rights of people in other nations, then the
people in the other nations should decline to purchase those resources,
or products made with them. </span>To do so would be to purchase
stolen property. If they have a dire need for the resources, they
should recognize the claims of all persons to the resources by
including the value of the resources in their own calculations of what
they appropriate from everyone's common heritage. In this way, economic
pressure would be put on all resource users to acknowledge the equal
rights of all persons to natural opportunities.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What if a nation refuses to share
the value of natural
opportunities among its citizens? A reasonable test of whether a
nation can properly be treated as the agent of its citizens and the
appropriate recipient of its citizens' shares of the value of natural
opportunities is whether the nation allows its citizens to leave. If
a nation does not allow its citizens to leave, then it is not proper
to treat the nation as the agent of its citizens. The citizens are
effectively imprisoned. We have no way of honoring our obligations
to them. We might put their shares in trust, but if they are not
allowed to leave, then we should not trust their government to use
their shares of the value of natural opportunities as they would
wish. On the other hand, if the citizens could leave and decline to
do so, and if there are some other nations that would accept them,
then we are justified in regarding their continued citizenship as
evidence of their implied consent to the decisions of their
government about how their shares of natural opportunities will be
used. This rule may induce governments that would otherwise keep
their citizens captive within their borders to instead allow them
liberty.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus the proper application of a
principle of equal rights of all
persons to natural opportunities will generate incentives for
increased compliance and increased liberty for all. It is not
necessary to have a world government that has the power to coerce all
nations to abide by a single authority's determination of what they
owe. Every nation can make its own determination of what, if
anything, they owe to others. Within broad limits people can accept
differing interpretations of obligations. If some nation exceeds the
limits of tolerance, other nations can reasonably respond by
declining to regard that nation or its citizens as the true owners of
the things they seek to trade. What is created is a diverse,
tolerant, and responsible international community.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is not necessary to achieve
universal acceptance of this theory
for it to be effective. What is necessary is acceptance by the major
economic powers, plus a willingness to condition economic relations
on an assurance that traded goods are not unjustly appropriated from
nature, and are not made with the labor of persons who are deprived
of their liberty to migrate if they choose.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a

  2006: <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/imprimis/">http://www.hillsdale.edu/imprimis/</a> <font size="-1">The
  following is an edited transcript of a conversation between Hillsdale College
  President Larry Arnn and Milton Friedman, which took place on May 22, 2006,
  at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in San Francisco, California, during a two-day Hillsdale
  College National Leadership Seminar celebrating the 25th anniversary of Milton
  and Rose Friedman's book, <em>Free to Choose: A Personal Statement</em>. </font>excerpt: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><em><strong>LA:</strong> Let me ask you about demographic trends.
      Columnist Mark Steyn writes that in ten years, 40 percent of young men
      in the world are going to be living in oppressed Muslim countries. What
      do you think the effect of that is going to be?</em></p>
  <p><strong>MF:</strong> What happens will depend on whether we succeed in bringing
    some element of greater economic freedom to those Muslim countries. Just
    as India in 1955 had great but unrealized potential, I think the Middle East
    is in a similar situation today. In part this is because of the curse of
    oil. Oil has been a blessing from one point of view, but a curse from another.
    Almost every country in the Middle East that is rich in oil is a despotism.</p>
  <p><em><strong>LA:</strong> Why do you think that is so?</em></p>
  <p><strong>MF:</strong> One reason, and one reason only &#8212; the oil is
    owned by the governments in question. If that oil were privately owned and
    thus someone's private property, the political outcome would be freedom rather
    than tyranny. This is why <strong>I believe the first step following the
    2003 invasion of Iraq should have been the privatization of the oil fields.
    If the government had given every individual over 21 years of age equal shares
    in a corporation that had the right and responsibility to make appropriate
    arrangements with foreign oil companies for the purpose of discovering and
    developing Iraq's oil reserves, the oil income would have flowed in the form
    of dividends to the people &#8212; the shareholders &#8212; rather than into
    government coffers.</strong> This would have provided an income to the whole
    people of Iraq and thereby prevented the current disputes over oil between
    the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, because oil income would have been distributed
    on an individual rather than a group basis.</p>
  <p><em><strong>LA:</strong> Many Middle Eastern societies have a kind of tribal
      or theocratic basis and long-held habits of despotic rule that make it
      difficult to establish a system of contract between strangers. Is it your
      view that the introduction of free markets in such places could overcome
      those obstacles?</em></p>
  <p>MF: Eventually, yes. I think that nothing is so important for freedom as
    recognizing in the law each individual's natural right to property, and giving
    individuals a sense that they own something that they're responsible for,
    that they have control over, and that they can dispose of.</p>

Expectations and Moral Evolution</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>General recognition of the equal
rights of all to the use of land
and other natural opportunities is hard to find. When the powerful
nations of the world got together to eject Iraq from Kuwait, very
little was heard of the bizarreness of supposing that Emir of Kuwait
and his relatives had a right to all the oil that lay under Kuwait.
Some recognition of equal rights to the use of natural opportunities
can be found in the proposed Law of the Sea Treaty, which would have
had all nations benefiting from the granting of franchises to extract
minerals from the sea. From an economic perspective, the treaty was
flawed by the fact that it would have created an artificial scarcity
of seabed mining activities in order to raise revenue, and it was
opposed by the U.S. and not implemented. But it did suggest general
recognition of global equal rights to at least those natural
opportunities that no one has yet begun to use.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One impediment to the recognition
of equal rights to the use of
natural opportunities is that some system of assessment would be
needed to identify the transfers that would compensate for unequal
access to natural opportunities. Another impediment is that a system
of rewards for those who discover new opportunities would be needed.
But if there were a will to address them, these technical
difficulties could be solved adequately, as they are in jurisdictions
such as Alberta, Canada, that claim all mineral rights for the
government. ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html"><span

<p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington and
    the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
    argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity, and
    are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained them
    from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and natural
    resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every one of the
    N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal beds, 1/Nth of
    the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile soil. God wills
    a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own vine and his own
    fig tree.</p>
  <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of
    land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
    of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
    Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the
    use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty
    years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary
    owner.</p>
  <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
    of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
    expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
    owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
    a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here I
    am anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
    in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
  <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
    of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements on it,
    practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not the original
    sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose to hold his &quot;fair
    share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay a land tax about equal to
    his dividend check, and so would break even. By 1/Nth of the land is meant
    land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the value of all the land in the country.</p>
  <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
    as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to hold
    more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would prefer
    to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check representing
    the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
  <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
    at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough to
    feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and 1/Nth
    of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population. A family
    of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend checks will
    enable them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied to that
    land is enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of course, they
    may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably, but the situation
    from which we start is one in which everyone has his own plot of ground from
    which to wrest a living by the strength of his own back, and any deviation
    from this is the result of voluntary exchanges agreed to by the parties directly
    involved, who judge themselves to be better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
  <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is extremely
    conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic ideas about
    land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles or gold
    or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking countries
    uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal property
    (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite
    of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
    means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the people.
    Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
    term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that the
    landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
    for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to property
    other than land, although complications arise when there are buildings on
    the land that is being seized.</p>
  <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
    support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
    Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
    Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
    F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized by
    Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and the
    Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight of the
    Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of the proposals
    of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>,
    1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco Modigliani, 1985;
    James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
    S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
  <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
    cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
    tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is about
    to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value of the land
    and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure you that real estate
    assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice to make the two assessments
    separately, and a parcel of land in the business district of a large city
    very often has a different owner from the building on it.) Many cities have
    moved to a system of taxing land more heavily than improvements, and most
    have been pleased with the results, finding that landholders are more likely
    to use their land productively -- to their own benefit and that of the public
    -- if their taxes do not automatically go up when they improve their land
    by constructing or maintaining buildings on it.</p>
  <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
    proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental and
    reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results of
    a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the difference
    in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other proposals of
    the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me absolute dictator
    of the world so that I can supervise the distribution, and if it doesn't
    work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that absolute dictators seldom
    resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every community, whatever its political name and extent &#8212; village, city,
      state or province or nation &#8212; has its own normal, unfailing income,
      growing with the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary
      governmental
      expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: <strong>Every community has an indefeasible original right to
        the land on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties
        and advantages of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land
        in its natural state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied,
        including its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in
        the community (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal
        right, while all the individuals together have a joint right to the value
        for use which society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</strong></p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p> Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.

  or
  Injustice: The Locational Benefit Levy</a></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Wetzel_Justice.html"></a>
We all have our own personal interpretation of how &#8220;justice&#8221; can be
achieved.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Often &#8220;justice&#8221; is interpreted in a very narrow legal sense and only in
reference to the judicial system, which has been designed to protect
the status quo. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Of course, all citizens (and subjects in the UK) -- need to know
exactly what are the legal boundaries within which society operates.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
But, supposing those original rules are unfair and unjust. Then the
legal framework, being used to perpetuate an injustice -- does not make
that injustice moral and proper even if within the rules of
jurisprudence it is &#8220;legal.&#8221;</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Obvious examples of this dislocation between immoral laws and natural
justice is </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>South Africa's former policy of apartheid; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the USA's former
segregated schools and buses; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>discrimination based on race, religion,
disability or sex; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>slavery; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the oppression of women; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Victorian
Britain's use of child labour and colonialism. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">All these policies were
&#8220;lawful&#8221; according to the legal framework of their day but that veneer
of legality did not make these policies righteous and just.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>
Any society built on a basis of injustice will be burdened down with
its own predisposition towards self-destruction. Even the most
suppressed people will one-day, demand justice, rise up and overthrow
their oppressors.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Human survival demands justice. Wherever slavery or dictatorship has
been installed -- eventually, justice has triumphed and a more
democratic and fairer system has replaced it. It is safe to predict
that wherever slavery or dictatorship exists today -- it will be
superseded by a fairer and more just system.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
Similarly, let's consider our distribution of natural resources.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
By definition, natural resources are not made by human effort. Our
planet offers every inhabitant a bounty -- an amazing treasure chest of
wealth that can supply our needs for food, shelter and every aspect for
our survival.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
Surely, &#8220;justice&#8221; demands that this natural wealth should be equally
available to all and that nobody should starve, be homeless or suffer
poverty simply because they are excluded from tapping in to this
enormous wealth that nature has provided. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
If our whole economy, with the private possession of land and other
natural resources, is built upon an injustice -- then can any of us
really be surprised that we continue to live on a planet where wars
predominate, intolerance is common, crime is rife and where poverty and
starvation is the norm for a huge percentage of earth's population.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Is this inherited system really the best we can do?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
There must be a method for fairly utilising the earth's natural
resources.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Referring to the rebuilding of
Iraq in
his recent speech to the American Congress, Tony Blair stated &#8220;We
promised Iraq democratic Government. We will deliver it. We promised
them the chance to use their oil wealth to build prosperity for all
their citizens, not a corrupt elite. We will do so&#8221;.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Thus, Tony Blair recognises the difference between political justice in
the form of a democratic Government and economic justice in the form of
sharing natural resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
We have not heard any dissenting voice from this promise to share
Iraq's natural oil wealth for all the people of Iraq to enjoy the
benefits. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But if it is so obviously
right and proper for the Iraqi people to share their natural
wealth &#8211; why is it not the practice to do the same in all nations?</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
No landowner can create land values. If this were the case, then an
entrepreurial landowner in the Scottish Highlands would be able to
create more value than an indolent landowner in the City of London.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
No, land values arise because of natural advantages (eg fertility for
agricultural land or approximity to ports or harbours for commercial
sites) or because of the efforts of the whole community -- past and
present investment by both the public and private sectors, and the
activities of individuals all give rise to land values. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why do we not
advocate the sharing of these land values, which are as much a gift of
nature and probably in most western economies are worth much more than
Iraqi oil?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
One solution would be to introduce a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Location
Benefit Levy</span>, where each site is valued, based on its optimum
permitted use and a levy is applied &#8211; a similar method to Britain's
commercial rates on buildings but based soley on the land value and
ignoring the condition of the building.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The outcome of this policy would be to give all citizens a share in the
natural wealth of the nation. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that landowners can speculate on empty sites,
denying their use for jobs or homes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that a factory owner can sack all their workers,
smash the roof of their building to let in the rain and be rewarded
with elimination of their rates bill.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that the poorest residents pay the highest share of
their incomes in Council Tax.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
It is an injustice that people are denied their share of the earth's
resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The Location Benefit Levy is a simple way to start addressing the
world's last great injustice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold;"
