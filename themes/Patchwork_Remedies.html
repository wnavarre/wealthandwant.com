    <p>Walter Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_WAHP.html">What
    Affordable Housing Problem?</a> </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Like all creatures --
      goldfinches, squirrels, butterflies, cicadas --
      we humans are squatters on this planet. We all need a part of earth for
      shelter, nourishment, a work site and a place to raise the next
      generation. Otherwise we perish. ... </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      In the 1980s, Washington, D.C., was concerned about its growing army of
      homeless. At that time I found there were 8,000 boarded-up dwelling
      units in our Nation's Capital -- more than enough to accommodate some
      5,000 street people. I also found there were 11,500 privately owned
      vacant lots in the District of Columbia, mostly zoned for and suitable
      for homes or apartments. Decent housing on these sites held in cold
      storage would have provided an alternative for the many low-income
      families squatting in places that were overcrowded, overpriced, overrun
      with vermin and overloaded with safety hazards.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      These issues spurred my research described in a 1988 report, "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Affordable Housing -- A Missing Link</span>."
      Evidence from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and other
      sources over a 30-year period revealed the following average cost
    increases of items that go into the building and maintenance of housing:</small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>Wages of general building construction workers rose 14
    percent a year.</small></li>
      <li><small>Wages of special trade construction workers rose 11
    percent a year.</small></li>
      <li><small>Construction material costs rose 11.5 percent a year.</small></li>
      <li><small>Combined wage-materials-managerial costs for residential
    building rose 12.5 percent a year.</small></li>
      <li><small>Fuel and utility costs for housing rose 13.8 percent a
    year. All
    of these costs closely tracked the Consumer Price Index which, over
    these same 30 years, rose by 12 percent a year. According to those
    figures, housing prices and housing rents apparently were held in check</small></li>
      </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
      Why do those statistics not seem to jibe with what you have been told,
    seen with your own eyes, and felt in your own pocketbooks?</small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>How to explain that, during the last decade of my research
    period, U.S.
    households with serious housing problems increased from 19 to 24
    millions?</small></li>
      <li><small>What caused the portion of renters paying more than 35
    percent of their
    income for housing doubled from 21 to 41 percent during the last two
    decades of the study period?</small></li>
      <li><small>Why were over 2.4 million renters paying 60 percent or
    more of their income for rent?</small></li>
      </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The
      answers would be obvious except that, so far, I have not mentioned
      what happened to the price of the land that housing sits on. Many of
      those who talk and write about housing conveniently overlook the fact
      that housing does not exist in mid air but is attached to the land, and
      that the price of this land has gone through the stratosphere.</small><br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
      In contrast to those 11- to 14-percent annual increases in
      housing-related costs, residential land values nationwide rose almost
      80 percent a year, or almost 2000 percent over those three
      decades.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>A close friend in
      Bethesda bought a house and lot there 40 years ago
      for $20,000. Two months ago he sold the property for a cool half
      million. That 2400 percent increase was entirely land value. The buyer
      immediately demolished the house to put up a larger one, so he clearly
      paid half a million for the location value -- the land value -- alone.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      Officials, civic leaders and commentators who bemoan the lack of
      affordable housing nevertheless applaud each rise in real estate values
      as a sign of prosperity. Seeing their own assets multiply through no
      effort of their own apparently makes them forget the teachers, firemen,
      police and low-income people who are boxed out of a place to squat in
      their cities and neighborhoods. ...</small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many of our
      Founding Fathers, George Washington included, had amassed huge estates.
      But the property tax induced them to sell off excess lands they were
      not using.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One
      of the many virtues of a tax on land values is that it can be
      introduced gradually. Cities that take this incremental approach report
      that homeowners-voters-taxpayers hardly notice the change. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">What's important in modernizing
      your taxation is not the speed of change but the direction you choose.</span>
      If you keep the present tax system with its disincentives for compact
      and wholesome growth, you will experience the treadmill effect that has
      been so familiar in so-called urban and housing "solutions." <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">You will
      have to keep running faster and faster with patchwork remedies to keep
      from sliding backward.</span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>
      A caution. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Revising taxes as proposed
      here will not end the need for
      housing subsidies, at least not in the short run, but it will do three
    things that should greatly reduce subsidies. </span></small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>One, by deflating land costs it will enable the private
    market to offer homes and sites at lower costs. 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>Two, this will shrink the number of families needing
    subsidies. 
      </small></li>
      <li><small>Three, it will stretch subsidy dollars farther because
    sites for publicly assisted housing can be acquired far more cheaply.</small></li>
      </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
      In Conclusion, I have tried to show that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">America has a housing land
      problem, not an affordable housing problem.</span> This problem can be
      substantially alleviated by freeing the market of anti-enterprise taxes
      and by<span style="font-weight: bold;"> turning the property tax right
      side up -- that is, by dropping
      tax rates on housing and by raising them on publicly-created land
    values. </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"

    <p>Walt Rybeck: <a
 href="../docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html">Have We
Forgotten The Foundation?</a></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, too few have a clue about
        how to deal with land issues, or any notion that archeological digs into
        our history might provide useful answers. Instead, consider what's happening:</small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Habitat volunteers build houses
            for the poor, making recipients and its volunteers feel real good.</span> This
            is a fine example of charity combined with self-help, and it spreads
            awareness of a great social ill. But more housing is being abandoned
            and demolished than Habitat is able to build.</small></li>
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This same treadmill effect
            undermines federal efforts. </span>HUD has spent billions on public
            housing, urban renewal and enterprise zones. Some of these programs
            have retarded urban decline but their strongest advocates would not
            claim they have come close to stopping or reversing it.</small></li>
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cities offer tax abatements
            to revive decaying business districts. </span>Yet after new buildings
            are established, the cities hit owners with the same tax burden that
            helped cause decay in the first place.</small></li>
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some builders turn to what
            I call "designer sprawl." </span>They mimic old towns and are clearly
            less wasteful of land than unplanned sprawl. Yet they often invade
            wheat fields and wood lots far from the job centers, transit lines
            and cultural institutions that comprise real communities -- while
            large quantities of usable sites that are well served by infrastructure
            lie fallow in those real cities and towns. These stumbling efforts
            recall an architectural parallel -- when people first tried rather
            pathetically to restore old neighborhoods with false storefronts,
            tarpaper bricks and Permastone.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urbanologists and the public need
        to be awakened to the central role played by taxation. They need to see
        that loss of our historic land tax has made speculation our top national
        sport -- a treacherous one at that. As Hans Blumenthal wrote in <span style="font-style: italic;">Metropolis...and
        Beyond</span> (edited by fellow panelist on this program, architect Paul
        Spreiregen):</small><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small> There is no doubt that the present
        real property tax...contributes more to depressing the standard of housing
        than all government housing policies combined do to raise it. The current
        property tax may fairly be called the upside-down tax. It taxes land
        values too lightly, buildings much too heavily. It rewards bad land use,
        penalizes good land use. Consider three identical homes and lots: </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 1 adds a rec room,
            new roof, great landscaping.</span> The assessor comes by and says,
            in effect: "As punishment for making a showplace, and for generating
            jobs and profits for local businesses, we're raising your assessment
            by the amount of your investments. Your tax bill will go up, not
            just for a year, but for as long as you keep the house in good condition."</small></li>
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 2 lets his house
            of the same size run down -- loose banisters, torn screens, broken
            gutters, junk-filled yard. </span>The assessor tells him, in effect: "Because
            you created an eyesore for your neighbors and an unsafe dwelling
            for your tenants, we're reducing your assessment and your taxes.
            If your place is more dilapidated next year, we'll reduce them even
            more."</small></li>
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owner No. 3 tears his building
            down; the idle lot neither houses nor employs anybody.</span> The
            friendly assessor tells him, in effect: "For completely wasting your
            property, and for making no use of the infrastructure provided for
            this area, we'll give you the lowest assessment and tax bill of the
            three." </small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>These all-too-familiar examples condemn
        not the assessor but our present tax system. And the same perverse property
        tax incentives apply to commercial properties. Is it any wonder cities
        are torn apart? The wretched tax on buildings is only the half of it.
        The low land tax is the other half. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A speculator sees that the annual increase in his
        or her land value is greater than the tax bill. This signals the owner
        to do nothing, to sit back and collect the values generated by productive
        neighbors and the community.</span></small></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p> <small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Speculation
            feeds on itself. The more land held out of use, the tighter the supply
            of available sites.</span> This raises land prices further, seducing
            more speculators into the land game, hastening the flight of residents
            and businesses from central cities and even small towns. This is
            far from the only cause of sprawl, but one of the most potent. It
            cannot be stressed too much because it is one of the least recognized
            causes.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>If we continue on our present course, overtaxing production and
      undertaxing land, the outlook is dismal. It is heading us toward the very
      conditions seen in extreme forms in Latin America and other continents.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Foundation.html"><span

    <p>H.G. Brown: <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">Significant
        Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
        14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </a>(in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Part
        X: The Law of Human Progress &#8212; Chapter 5: The Central Truth</a>)</p>
    </div>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our
              inquiry is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the
              growth and decay of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated
              recognitions of relation and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions.
              Thus are given to our conclusions the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils
              arising from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are becoming
              more and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents
              of progress, but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they
              will not cure themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause
              is removed, grow greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism
              by the road every previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that
              these evils are not imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from
              social maladjustments which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their
              cause we shall be giving an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance
        pinches and embrutes men, and all the manifold evils which flow from
        it, spring from a denial of
              justice. In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities
        which nature freely offers to all, we have ignored the fundamental law
        of justice &#8212; for,
              so far as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice
        seems to be the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this
        injustice
              and asserting the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we
        shall conform ourselves to the law &#8212; </p>

      <div style="text-align: center;">

              and by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of
              political rights will not compensate for the denial of the equal
              right to the
              bounty of nature. Political liberty, when the equal right to land
              is denied, becomes,
              as population increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty
              to compete for employment at starvation wages. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/14_Liberty_Equality_Opportunity.htm">read the whole
