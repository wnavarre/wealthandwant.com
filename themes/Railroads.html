<blockquote>
  <p>    The invention of the steam engine and the building of the Erie Canal
      and the railroads were both important pieces of infrastructure which made
      land
      in western
      parts
      of
      the US significantly
    more valuable.  Passengers and goods could make the trip in much shorter time and with less expense and danger.<br>
    <br>
    If you've played the board game Monopoly, you have some notion that railroads played
    an important role in 19th and 20th century America &#8212; and that
    transportation is absolutely vital to our economy.&nbsp; But an
    important part of American history &#8212; one we all heard in high school
    history but whose importance we were perhaps too young to understand &#8212; was the scale and effects of the landholdings of the railroads, which few realize continue
    today.&nbsp; Southern Pacific, for example, owns a great deal of land,
    some of it quite valuable, today. <br>

 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">
  </a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>UPON the plains this season
railroad building is progressing with a rapidity never before known.
The two companies, in their struggle for the enormous bounty offered by
the Government, are shortening the distance between the lines of rail
at the rate of from seven to nine miles a day -- almost as fast as the
ox teams which furnished the primitive method of conveyance across the
continent could travel. Possibly by the middle of next spring, and
certainly, we are told, before mid-summer comes again, this "greatest
work of the age" will be completed, and an unbroken track stretch from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the railroad to do for <span
 style="font-style: italic;">us</span>? -- this railroad that we have
looked for, hoped for, prayed for so long?<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>After the first impulse which
settled California had subsided,
there came a time of stagnation, if not of absolute decay. As the
placers one after another were exhausted, the miners moved off; once
populous districts were deserted, there are probably but few of us
who once flourishing mining towns fell into ruin, and it seemed to
superficial observers as though the State had passed the acme of her
prosperity.<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Through this period we have passed. Although
the decay of portions of the mining regions still continues, there
has been going on for some time a steady, rapid development of the
State at large -- felt principally in the agricultural counties and the
metropolis, but which is now beginning to make itself felt from one
end of the State to the other. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To
produce this, several causes have
combined, but prominent among them must be reckoned the new force to
which we principally and primarily look for the development of the
future -- railroads.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...&nbsp; Yet the growth of San
Francisco has hardly commenced -- growing now with greater rapidity
than ever, her greatest growth will date from the completion of the
railroad next year. The San Francisco of the new era will be a city
compared with which the San Francisco of the present is only a little
village.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Look for a moment at the geographical position of this city, and
all doubt as to her future rank will be dispelled. There is in the
whole world no city -- not even Constantinople, New Orleans, or
Panama -- which possesses equal advantages. From San Diego to the
Columbia river, a stretch of over 1000 miles of coast, the bay of San
Francisco is the only possible site for a great city. For the whole
of the vast and rich country behind, this is the only gate to the
sea. Not a settler in all the Pacific States and Territories but must
pay San Francisco tribute; not an ounce of gold dug, a pound of ore
smelted, a field gleaned, or a tree felled in all their thousands of
square miles, but must, in a greater or less degree, add to her
wealth.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Considering these things, is it
too much to say that this city of
ours must become the first city of the continent; and is it too much
to say that the first city of the continent must ultimately be the
first city of the world? And when we remember the irresistible
tendency of modern times to concentration -- remember that New York,
Paris and London are still growing faster than ever -- where shall we
set bounds to the future population and wealth of San Francisco;
where find a parallel for the city which a century hence will
<span style="font-style: italic;">surround </span>this bay?<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For years the high rate of
interest and the high rate of wages
prevailing in California have been special subjects for the
lamentation of a certain school of local political economists, who
could not see that high wages and high interest were indications that
the natural wealth of the country was not yet monopolized, that great
opportunities were open to all -- who did not know that these were
evidences of social health, and that it were as wise to lament them
as for the maiden to wish to exchange the natural bloom on her cheek
for the interesting pallor of the invalid? 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But however this be, it is
certain that the tendency of the new era -- the more dense population
and more thorough development of the wealth of the State -- will be
to a reduction both of the rate of interest and the rate of wages,
particularly the latter. This tendency may not, probably will not, be
shown immediately; but it will be before long, and that powerfully,
unless balanced and counteracted by other influences which we are not
now considering, which do not yet appear, and which it is probable
will not appear for some time yet.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
truth is, that the completion of the railroad and the
consequent great increase of business and population, will not be a
benefit to all of us, but only to a portion.</span> As a general rule
(liable of course to exceptions) those who <span
 style="font-style: italic;">have</span> it will make
wealthier; for those who <span style="font-style: italic;">have not</span>,
it will make it more difficult to
get. Those who have lands, mines, established businesses, special
abilities of certain kinds, will become richer for it and find
increased opportunities; those who have only their own labor will be
come poorer, and find it harder to get ahead -- first, because it will
take more capital to buy land or to get into business; and second,
because as competition reduces the wages of labor, this capital will
be harder for them to obtain.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What, for instance, does the rise
in land mean? Several things,
but certainly and prominently this: that it will be harder in future
for a poor man to get a farm or a homestead lot. In some sections of
the State, land which twelve months ago could have been had for a
dollar an acre, cannot now be had for less than fifteen dollars. In
other words, the settler who last year might have had at once a farm
of his own, must now either go to work on wages for some one else,
pay rent or buy on time; in either case being compelled to give to
the capitalist a large proportion of the earnings which, had he
arrived a year ago, he might have had all for of himself. And as
proprietorship is thus rendered more difficult and less profitable to
the poor, more are forced into the labor market to compete with each
other, and cut down the rate of wages -- that is, to make the division
of their joint production between labor and capital more in favor of
capital and less in favor of labor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And so in San Francisco the rise
in building lots means, that it
will be harder for a poor man to get a house and lot for himself, and
if he has none that he will have to use more of his earnings for
rent; means a crowding of the poorer classes together; signifies
courts, slums, tenement-houses, squalor and vice.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>San Francisco has one great
advantage -- there is probably a larger proportion of her population
owning homesteads and homestead lots than in any other city of the
United States. The product of the rise of real estate will thus be more
evenly distributed, and the great social and political advantages of
this diffused proprietorship cannot be over-estimated. Nor can it be
too much regretted that the princely domain which San Francisco
inherited as the successor of the pueblo was not appropriated to
furnishing free, or almost free, homesteads to actual settlers, instead
of being allowed to pass into the hands of a few, to make more
millionaires. Had the matter been taken up in time and in a proper
spirit, this disposition might easily have been secured, and the great
city of the future would have had a population bound to her by the
strongest ties-a population better, freer, more virtuous, independent
and public spirited than any great city the world has ever had. ...<a

<p>  Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased value
    which they give to land? To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated
    railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. But this great
    public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots. The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads ought not to be
    taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. It is the increased land values which
    they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
  <p>So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
    all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most prosperous
    which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity
    for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax what we
    want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We should tax that which
    results from the general prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is
    the increase of population, the extension of cultivation, the manufacture
    of goods, the building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value of land &#8212; not
    the increase in the value of land that induces the increase of population
    and increase of wealth. It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now
    worth hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers,
    it was only worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people,
    and so much more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and
    the increase of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased.
    Increase of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
    And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
    does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
    it. It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
    lays it.</p>
  <p>Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion. The
    tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It does
    not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost ease
    and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p> <span class="style1">[08] </span>But to the changes  produced by growth are, with us, added the changes brought about by  improved industrial methods. The tendency of steam and of machinery is  to the division of labor, to the concentration of wealth and power.  Workmen are becoming massed by hundreds and thousands in the employ of  single individuals and firms; small storekeepers and merchants are  becoming the clerks and salesmen of great business houses; we have  already corporations whose revenues and pay-rolls belittle those of the  greatest States. And with this concentration grows the facility of  combination among these great business interests. How readily the  railroad companies, the coal operators, the steel producers, even the  match manufacturers, combine, either to regulate prices or to use the  powers of government! The tendency in all branches of industry is to  the formation of rings against which the individual is helpless, and  which exert their power upon government whenever their interests may  thus be served. </p>
  <p><font size="-2">[15]</font> We are steadily differentiating a governing class, or rather a class
  of Pretorians, who make a business of gaining political power and then selling
  it. The type of the rising party leader is not the orator or statesman of an
  earlier day, but the shrewd manager, who knows how to handle the workers, how
  to combine pecuniary interests, how to obtain money and to spend it, how to
  gather to himself followers and to secure their allegiance. One party machine
  is becoming complementary to the other party machine, the politicians, like
  the railroad managers, having discovered that combination pays better than
  competition. So rings are made impregnable and great pecuniary interests secure
  their ends no matter how elections go. There are sovereign States so completely
  in the hands of rings and corporations that it seems as if nothing short of
  a revolutionary uprising of the people could dispossess them. Indeed, whether
  the General Government has not already passed beyond popular control may be
  doubted. Certain it is that possession of the General Government has for some
  time past secured possession. And for one term, at least, the Presidential
  chair has been occupied by a man not elected to it. This, of course, was largely
  due to the crookedness of the man who was elected, and to the lack of principle
  in his supporters. Nevertheless, it occurred.</p>
  <p><font size="-2">[16]</font> As for the great railroad managers, they may well say, &quot;The people
    be d--d!&quot; When they want the power of the people they buy the people's
    masters. The map of the United States is colored to show States and Territories.
    A map of real political powers would ignore State lines. Here would be a big
    patch representing the domains of Vanderbilt; there Jay Gould's dominions would
    be brightly marked. In another place would be set off the empire of Stanford
    and Huntington; in another the newer empire of Henry Villard. The States and
    parts of States that own the sway of the Pennsylvania Central would be distinguished
    from those ruled by the Baltimore and Ohio; and so on. In our National Senate,
    sovereign members of the Union are supposed to be represented; but what are
    more truly represented are railroad kings and great moneyed interests, though
    occasionally a jobber from Nevada or Colorado, not inimical to the ruling
    powers, is suffered to buy himself a seat for glory. And the Bench as well
    as the Senate is being filled with corporation henchmen. A railroad king makes
    his attorney a judge of last resort, as the great lord used to make his chaplain
    a bishop. <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[01] </font>THE trees, as I write, have not yet begun to leaf,
  nor even the blossoms to appear; yet, passing down the lower part of Broadway
  these early days of
  spring, one breasts a steady current of uncouthly dressed men and women, carrying
  bundles and boxes and all manner of baggage. As the season advances, the human
  current will increase; even in winter it will not wholly cease its flow. It
  is the great gulf-stream of humanity which sets from Europe upon America &#8212; 
  the greatest migration of peoples since the world began. Other minor branches
  has the stream. Into Boston and Philadelphia, into Portland, Quebec and Montreal,
  into New Orleans, Galveston, San Francisco and Victoria, come offshoots of
  the same current; and as it flows it draws increasing volume from wider sources.
  Emigration to America has, since 1848, reduced the population of Ireland by
  more than a third; but as Irish ability to feed the stream declines, English
  emigration increases; the German outpour becomes so vast as to assume the first
  proportions, and the millions of Italy, pressed by want as severe as that of
  Ireland, begin to turn to the emigrant ship as did the Irish. In Castle Garden
  one may see the garb and hear the speech of all European peoples. From the
  fiords of Norway, from the plains of Russia and Hungary, from the mountains
  of Wallachia, and from Mediterranean shores and islands, once the center of
  classic civilization, the great current is fed. Every year increases the facility
  of its flow. Year by year improvements in steam navigation are practically
  reducing the distance between the two continents; <strong>year by year European railroads
  are making it easier for interior populations to reach the seaboard</strong>, and the
  telegraph, the newspaper, the schoolmaster and the cheap post are lessening
  those objections of ignorance and sentiment to removal that are so strong with
  people long rooted in one place. Yet, in spite of this great exodus, the population
  of Europe, as a whole, is steadily increasing.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Sources of Great
Wealth</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> An acquaintance of mine died in
San Francisco recently,
leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in
England. I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more
temperate than he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This
man did not get his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He
no more produced it than did those lucky relations in England who may
now do nothing for the rest of their lives. He became rich by getting
hold of a piece of land in the early days, which, as San Francisco
grew, became very valuable. His wealth represented not what he had
earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of the earth's surface
enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the
other day, leaving $3,000,000.
He may or may not have been particularly industrious, skilful and
economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that he got
so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby
through a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against
the pauper labor of Europe," gave him the advantage of a
sixty-per-cent, tariff. To the day of his death he was a stanch
protectionist, and said free trade would ruin our "infant
industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to lay by
from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by
the tariff that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's
earnings.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Beneath all political
problems lies the social problem of
the distribution of wealth."</small></center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element of monopoly, of
appropriation and spoliation
will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account for
all great fortunes....</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt
fortune. The first Vanderbilt was a
boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it. But it was not
working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money
enough he used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He
ran off opposition lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel.
Then he went into railroads, pursuing the same tactics. The
Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working and saving than did the
fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune.
Mr. Gould might have got his
first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial. But
it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions.
It was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures,
getting up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock
values and transportation rates. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great
fortunes which the Pacific
railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations
of Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by
monopolizing and gouging. And so of fortunes made by such
combinations as the Standard Oil Company, the Bessemer Steel Ring,
the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and the various rings
for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper labor of
Europe." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of
successful patents. Like that
element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased value of
land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I am
not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make
fortunes out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and,
in fact, through nearly all
acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes, these
elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me
recently, "It is not on our ordinary business that we make our money;
it is where we can get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally
true.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>The Evils of
Monopolists</b></small>
<br>
<small> Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the
increase of land values has had, and is having, in the United States.
This is, of course, monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in
value it does not mean that its owner has added to the general
wealth. The owner may never have seen the land or done aught to
improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant city or in
another country. Increase of land values simply means that the
owners, by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed
before man was, have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth
produced by other people's labor. Consider how much the monopolies
created and the advantages given to the unscrupulous by the tariff
and by our system of internal taxation -- how much the railroad (a
business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water and other
similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and
stock-gambling, the destructive use of wealth in driving off or
buying off opposition which the public must finally pay for, and many
other things which these will suggest, have operated to build up
large fortunes, and it will at least appear that the unequal
distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many
who work little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the
earnings of the one class are, in one way or another, filched away
from them to swell the incomes of the other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly
making their way from the
ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the ranks of those
who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state of things
right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that
piracy was right and that no effort should be made to suppress
it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I am not denouncing the rich, nor
seeking, by speaking of
these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get a clear
understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that it
is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which
we give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by
law and by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so
enormously rich while others remain so miserably poor. If we look
around us and note the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation
which go to the building up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see
on the one hand now disingenuous are those who preach to us that
there is nothing wrong in social relations and that the inequalities
in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities of human
nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk as
though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
restricting the acquisition of wealth. <strong>Capital is a good; the
capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely
let any one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in
doing so.</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There are deep wrongs in the
present constitution of society,
but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in
those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are
the laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from
bad
adjustments which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social
state is not that in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but
in which each gets in proportion to his contribution to the general
stock. And in such a social state there would not be less incentive
to exertion than now; there would be far more incentive. Men will be
more industrious and more moral, better workmen and better citizens,
if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his family, than
where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them until
some have far more than they could have earned, and others have
little or nothing.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Corruption of
Economics</b>
</small><br>
<small>As I explained, classical economics emerged from a school of
thinkers known as the Scottish moralists in the latter part of the
18th century. There ultimately evolved three major schools of
economic thought a century later, one the continuing tradition of
Adam Smith through J.S. Mill, a second being the aggressive and
emerging school of Marxism, and the third a proposal for two-factor
economics being pressed largely by interests in America. Marxism was
never a major force in United States; the primary challenge to the
classical tradition came from what has since come to be known as
neo-classical economics.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><a href="../auth/Gaffney.html">Professor
      Gaffney</a> has for the
first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly-established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged.<span style="font-weight: bold;">
What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. </span>This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The classical tradition of
economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age:<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Henry George</span>. All
but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the assiduous
disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book, <b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></i></b>, sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
traveled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and traveled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In classical economics, the
definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather than being
returned to society in rent. The failure of society to recapture the
appropriate level of land rent from titleholders led also to
depression of labor wages at the margin, creating poverty and
artificial scarcity of labor where otherwise it could be relieved.
Hence the title of George's book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.
George recognized that the value of any land parcel arose out of its
social activity, not from anything which a titleholder might have
done to it. He recognized that many, perhaps most, titleholders in
land were speculators, reaping the benefit of others' investments,
and selling out at last when their price was met. Hence it made sense
that society had a right to a return on what it had brought about, as
well as from the fact that those titles could never be other than
leaseholds. That land rent, shortly confused by use of the words
"single tax," was, to George, the rightful return to society.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
railroad barons of the 19th century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names.</span> Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson
White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors, to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885. The actual
intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got appointed and
promoted, who was funded in research, which were given endowed
chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation with
defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount preoccupation
of all of these figures. The central figures were:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President
of MIT
and Director of the Census Bureau.</small></li>
  <li><small>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of
economics
at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
own Institute with railroad money.</small></li>
  <li><small>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia
University,
and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
then Smith College.</small></li>
  <li><small>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at
Columbia
University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These figures are even today the
honored founders of an esteemed
profession. So great was their victory over rival schools of thought
that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear thinking and
virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten. The
lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, Friedman,
Harberger and now thousands of Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed,
when Henry George ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against
the wealthy patrician Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who
had recently recruited Clark to come to Columbia. To really
understand the academic tension of the period, one must look at the
published papers, the speeches and debates, the newspaper articles,
and the citations at the end of those articles. These, even more than
the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments, explain how
much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. <b>Was it for the
falsity of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then
have managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather,
it was the threat George represented to powerful interests that
required him to be defeated</b>, and in doing so they succeeded but
only in the short run, as they were within decades victims of their
very successes. Today we see that the railroads have failed in this
country for lack of traffic. It will soon be evident why.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a
progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base. </small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those economists who today still
persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a
small minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they
are, they are among its most esteemed members.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Two-factor economics, however, had
advantages to influential
individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit. This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. In
three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner. When a railroad magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. All across America, land speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Costs of Poor
Taxes</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Society pays a price for not
adopting taxes which follow the
principles developed over the centuries. Here I want only to show how
the resulting distortions that arose in the use of land ultimately
caused the railroads to fail in being able to serve society. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">While in
the short term the railroads certainly saved themselves from having
to pay taxes on their vast land holdings, the most valuable of which
were right around their own investment in tracks and stations, they
ultimately lost the frequency of traffic which that tax structure
would have induced. </span>This is because the population and
improvement
densities needed to make public transit traffic economically viable
did not come about. Taking the long view of society, George Kennen
notes in one of his books that:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>The railway. . . was
capable of accepting and disgorging
its loads, whether of passengers or freight, only at fixed points. This
being the case, it tended to gather together, and to concentrate around
its urban terminus and railhead, all activity that was in any way
related to movements of freight or passengers into or out of the city.
It was in this quality that it had made major and in some ways decisive
contributions to the development not only of the great railway
metropolises of the Victorian age particularly of such inland cities as
Moscow, Berlin, Paris, and Chicago but even certain of the great
maritime turnover ports, such as London and New York.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
automobile, on the other hand, had precisely the opposite
qualities.</span> Incapable, in view of its own cumbersomeness and
requirements for space, of accepting or releasing large loads at any
concentrated points anywhere, but peculiarly capable of accepting and
releasing them at multitudes of unconcentrated points anywhere else,
the automobile tended to disintegrate and to explode all that the
railway had brought together. It was, in fact, the enemy of the
concentrated city. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus it was
destined to destroy the great densely
populated urban centers of the nineteenth century, with all the
glories of economic and cultural life that had flowed from their very
unity and compactness.</span>... <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span

<br>
Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition, George
differentiated sharply between land itself and
the products -- or wealth, as he termed them -- which labor made from
the land. "In producing wealth, labor, with the aid of natural
forces, but works up, into the forms desired, pre-existing matter,
and, to produce wealth, must, therefore, have access to this matter
and to these forces -- that is to say, to land. The land is the
source of all wealth. It is the mine from which must be drawn the ore
that labor fashions. It is the substance to which labor gives the
form."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> George saw, as between land and
products, certain elementary
differences. "In every essential, land differs from those things
which... [are] the product of human labor. ...It is the
creation of God; they are produced by man. It is fixed in quantity;
they may be increased illimitably. It exists, though generations come
and go; they in a little while decay and pass again into the
elements." </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Having noted these differences,
George proceeded to use them as
the basis for his examination of related areas of economics, such as
speculation. When asked how speculation worked, George responded that
a distinction must be made between speculation in land and
speculation in products. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Writing of industrial depressions,
he said, "When, with the desire
to consume more, there coexist the ability and willingness to produce
more, industrial and commercial paralysis cannot be charged either to
overproduction or to overconsumption. Manifestly, the trouble is that
production and consumption cannot meet and satisfy each other . </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"How does this inability arise? It
is evidently and by common
consent the result of speculation. But of speculation in what? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Certainly not of speculation in
things which are the products of
labor ...for the effect of speculation in such things, as is well
shown in current treatises that spare me the necessity of
illustration, is simply to equalize supply and demand, and to steady
the interplay of production and consumption by an action analogous to
that of a fly-wheel in a machine."&nbsp; In other
words, the tendency of speculation in products is to increase the
demand for products and therefore to increase the price of products.
This increased price will induce more production, which, increasing
the supply, will tend to lower the price. Throughout this cycle,
there has been a stimulating effect on production in general. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He continued, "Therefore, if
speculation be the cause of these
industrial depressions, it must be speculation in things not the
production of labor, but yet necessary to the exertion of labor in
the production of wealth -- of things of fixed quantity; that is to
say, it must be speculation in land."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How can this be? How can
speculation in land cause industrial
depression? George explains, "...that there is a connection between
the rapid construction of railroads and industrial depression, anyone
who understands what increased land values mean, and who has noticed
the effect which the construction of railroads has upon land
speculation, can easily see. Wherever a railroad was built or
projected, lands sprang up in value under the influence of
speculation, and thousands of millions of dollars were added to the
nominal values which capital and labor were asked to pay outright, or
to pay in installments, as the price of being allowed to go to work
and produce wealth. The inevitable result was to check production.
.."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The tendency of speculation in
land is similar to that of
speculation in products; it increases the demand for land and thereby
increases the price of land. However, here the similarity ends. The
supply of land is fixed; as successive units of land become priced
beyond the level at which labor and capital can profitably engage in
production, an increasing (though artificial) scarcity of land
develops. "The inevitable result was to check production."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So, according to George, another
difference between land and
products is that speculation in products tends to stimulate
production, whereas speculation in land tends to check production.&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"> <span

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And yet, the urban price influence
of Los Angeles extends over 89
miles east-south-east clear to Temecula and Murrieta and beyond, at
which point, however, it meets demand pushing north from San Diego.
Urban valuation fever thus affects much more land than can ever
actually be developed for urban use. Regardless, most owners come to
imagine they might cash in at a high price, with high zoning, at
their own convenience, with public services supplied by "the public,"
meaning other taxpayers. This is the meaning of "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">floating value</span>."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If their land is downzoned for
farming, open space, or habitat,
they regard it as a "taking," and plead the 14th Amendment. Once we
buy into the Sanctity (Holiness, Sacredness) of private property, we
owe them. If we think of the public's buying large quantities of it
to preserve habitat or open space, the price is already high above
its aggregate value, and the new demand will push the price higher
yet.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a case showing how this
works. The Los Angeles
Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) needed the old Union Station,
northeast of downtown in a run-down neighborhood, as the centerpiece
of its new, integrated mass transit system. With the decline of
interurban passenger rail traffic, the old station was unused. The
owners, mainly Southern Pacific, asked more than MTA offered, so MTA
invoked its power of <span style="font-weight: bold;">eminent domain</span>
and condemned the land. The case
went to judgement, and in 1984 the court awarded SP an amount about
twice the going price for land in the area. <i>The court's reason was
that the coming of mass transit would raise values around the new
central station, and SP should be paid as much as neighboring
landowners would be able to get after the station was built.</i></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus, land originally <i>granted</i>
to SP to help subsidize
mass transit was used instead to obstruct and penalize mass transit.
Private property had become an end in itself, Holy and Sacred, a
welfare entitlement, rather than a means to an end. MTA (the
taxpayers) had to pay a price for land based on the unearned
increment that its own construction and operation was expected to
create in the future.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Later, MTA was to stint on subway
construction, resulting in
subsidence on Hollywood Boulevard, but there was no stinting on
paying off SP for doing nothing: the award came to $84.7 millions.
<b>This is how the 14th Amendment works in practice, making private
property an end, sanctified for its own sake, rather than a means to
a higher end. It makes landowners the spoiled children of the
national family, inflating the cost of every program that entails
acquiring land. It means there is no chance that the public, whether
through government or the Nature Conservancy, can preserve more than
token areas of habitat by buying it: it would bankrupt us.</b>... <a

Fe-Southern Pacific (SFSP)</span>,
headquartered in Chicago in its own building, was a near-merger of two
of California's largest landholders. SP alone was already the largest
before the attempted merger, and had been, from the age of railroad
"robber barons" (Stanford, Crocker, Huntington and Flood),
beneficiaries of vast federal land grants in California. The U.S.
Government even acquired a key right-of-way, the Mesilla Valley route,
from Mexico to give the SP (the "Gadsden Purchase," 1853). In 1988 SP,
(or some part of it, along with the name) was sold to Philip Anschutz,
Denver oil man, who is liquidating some lands.</small><br>
<br>
<small>SFSP holdings now include: </small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rights-of-way</span>,
including
the right to
preempt intersections on demand. These are key assets that might be
used for mass transit, but have long been withheld from such use. (In
January, 1991, SP did agree to sell 85 miles, including the Peninsula
commuter line, to Santa Clara, San Francisco and San Mateo Counties,
for $290 millions. Sante Fe, on the other hand, is holding out for over
$1 billion for some mileage in L.A. and Riverside Counties.) The
rights-of-way give their owners preferential access to our great ports,
built and improved at public expense. Growing Pacific Basin trade, and
evolving container-shipping techniques, keep the tracks busy night and
day.&nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Railyards</span>.
Wherever there
are stations there are railyards,
usually just off the central business district. Riverside yards are
small; Bloomington and San Bernardino yards cover hundreds of acres.
Union Station in Los Angeles., with yards, covers about 70 acres east
of Sunset/Olvera, and is about to be redeveloped, and made the focus of
mass transit in Los Angeles. (LAT, 5/88) Just northeast of downtown,
this land has the potential of rising to downtown value levels. (See
Appendix 1, The Union Station Condemnation.) The L.A. Produce Market
Mission Bay Development, San Francisco, is 208 acres of old yards just
south of San Francisco's central business district, where land sells
for over $1,000 per square foot. 158,000 acres of farmland, west side
of San Joaquin Valley, watered by California Water Project under heavy

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the improved urban lands,

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some of the lands of SPSF are <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">oil-bearing</span>,
in several states. (TPE,
9/87; LAT 11/87)</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The value of SF &amp; SP lands
is hard
for Wall St. to know because so
much of it is undeveloped or underdeveloped. Estimates range from $2
billion to $9 billion.</span> Tax assessments understate values for
several
reasons. Traditionally, SF &amp; SP devoted major legal effort to
holding down assessed values below market. Assessors tend anyway to
undervalue vacant acreage, perhaps because of such pressure. In 1988
SFSP was in courts all over California opposing reassessments which
county assessors claimed were triggered by the attempted merger of 1983.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Local real estate people know local values, but Wall St. looks
more at
current earnings -- except when corporate raiders go to work on "asset
plays." SP has long been noted for having latent values yielding no
current earnings. They have now bid up the stock to 30 times earnings.
For perhaps the first time in its history SFSP is now a "motivated
seller," to fend off the raid. In 1987 the "Henley Group" was a threat.
So was Olympia and York, a large developer specializing in urban real
estate, and in 1987 considered a major threat.</small><br>
<br>
<small>SPSF recently sold off much of its Corona holdings. It took the
indirect route of a stock market raid to pry loose these surplus lands
-- an indication of market failure. It remains to be seen if the new
owners will put the land to good use, or continue to hold it simply as
an idle "store of value."</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overall, SFSP lands are
estimated to
be 2.4 million acres in California, or 4.8% of the privately held land
area. Nationwide holdings are 5.2 million acres . 28,500 acres of this
are developed C&amp;I land. </span>(Riverside Press-Enterprise, 9/87;
