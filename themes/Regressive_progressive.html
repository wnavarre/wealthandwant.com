  <p><strong>Abstract<br>
    </strong>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented
    by the large proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on
    wages and on interest by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income;
    it is income that arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation;
    it comes about as a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is
    ample moral warrant for society to lay claim to that which it has created,
    as well as to that which no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly
    makes clear that economic rent in all its forms is far larger than official
    government figures indicate; in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant
    all current taxes on labor and capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged
    to have so many negative effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations
    by taxing its various bases actually can foster economic performance and
    yield other benefits that make it the natural source of revenue for governments.
    Such a tax is essentially painless. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Tax Principles</strong></p>
  <p>The starting points should be the lessons that have been learned over the
    course of the past three hundred and more years about what is a good tax.
    Most basic textbooks in public finance enumerate them in very clear form,
    and they constitute benchmarks against which to measure the soundness of
    any particular tax. They are listed as few as three or as many as eight such
    principles but little disagreement exists as to their substance, regardless
    of ideology or government. Most commonly enumerated are neutrality, efficiency,
    equity, administrability, simplicity, stability, sufficiency.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> Tax
    theorists typically measure revenue structures according to any or all of
    these criteria: ... </p>
  <p>The principle of <strong>equity</strong> is central to any discussion of
    tax design. Tax design requires concern with both what is fair and the extent
    to which it must sometimes be compromised to satisfy the other principal
    criteria. Fairness can be evaluated according to what is termed &quot;horizontal
    equity&quot; -- the extent to which those in similar circumstances will pay
    similar tax burdens, and &quot;vertical equity&quot; -- how well those in
    different classes bear different burdens in the tax structure. It is this
    latter perspective that leads to the use of terms like &quot;proportional,&quot; &quot;progressive,&quot; and &quot;regressive&quot; in
    referring to tax structures. A tax is progressive with respect to income
    if the ratio of tax revenue to income rises when moving up the income scale,
    proportional if the ratio is constant, and regressive if the ratio declines.
    There is an ancillary question of whether taxing to reach greater equity
    should employ measures of income or of wealth, difficult as this is to measure.
    Such questions of equity are a matter particularly central when discussing
    the property tax. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_Painless.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The principle of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">equity
    </span>is central to any discussion of tax design.&nbsp; Tax design
    requires concern with both what is fair and the extent to which it must
    sometimes be compromised to satisfy the other principal criteria.
    Fairness can be evaluated according to what is termed "horizontal
    equity" &#8212; the extent to which those in similar circumstances will
    pay similar tax burdens, and "vertical equity" &#8212;  how well those in
    different classes bear different burdens in the tax structure. It is
    this latter perspective that leads to the use of terms like
"proportional," "progressive," and "regressive" in referring to tax
    structures. A tax is progressive with respect to income if the ratio of
    tax revenue to income rises when moving up the income scale,
    proportional if the ratio is constant, and regressive if the ratio
    declines. There is an ancillary question of whether taxing to reach
    greater equity should employ measures of income or of wealth, difficult
    as this is to measure. Such questions of equity are a matter
    particularly central when discussing the property tax.&nbsp; This will
    be discussed further below.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The one criticism often levied against the
    conventional property tax is its <span style="font-weight: bold;">regressivity</span>.&nbsp;
  This is somewhat belied by the facts.&nbsp; Only two empirical studies
    have ever been done on the subject, but both concluded that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the real property tax is mildly progressive</span>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>&nbsp;
  When the two elements of the property tax are taken separately, it
    becomes even clearer why this is so: the tax on the land component of
    real property, being inelastic, cannot be shifted to tenants, and is
    borne solely by the titleholder to the property.&nbsp; Only the
    improvement part of the real property tax is in any way now shifted to
    tenants, and its elimination means the most oppressive component is
    gone.&nbsp; When it comes to incidence of payment, the roughly 35
    percent of all American households who rent and do not own (largely
    poor people) bear none of that tax burden whatsoever.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Even among the homeowning element of the
    American population, studies have shown that a shift of the tax to land
    values typically lowers the burden on about two thirds of all
    households.&nbsp;</span> This is because <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">tax districts where homes are
    situated are typically not in highest land value neighborhoods, and it
    is business and commercial sites -- particularly the underused land
    parcels in those neighborhoods -- that typically bear a larger burden.<small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></small></small></span>
  So
    in fact a tax on land values is really a profound shift in the
  direction of progressivity. ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
    common argument for sales and income taxes over property taxes is
    their "broad base," discouraging the poor from voting for public
    extravagance. "Broad-based" seems quite like </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"regressive." ...</span><br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>The Property
    Tax is not Primarily Shifted Forward</b>
  <br>
  With a base so concentrated, it requires some creative methods to
    find the property tax regressive. One is to assume general forward
    shifting. Then the property owner is exempt, except as a homeowner.
    Tenants do not escape. No one does. The property tax becomes a
    general consumption tax, and therefore regressive. I submit several
    reasons why the property tax is not shifted forward. <strong>...</strong><br>
  <br>
  All cartels are characterized by excess
    capacity -- that is of the essence. When you consider that half the
    wells in Texas are surplus -- need I go on? In a cartelized society
    like ours the forward shifting thesis is not just shaky but
    ludicrous. Untaxing property, as by revenue sharing, would
    strengthen the hand of every cartel now locking up excess capacity. It
    is not the property tax but the lack of one that would be shifted
forward in higher prices.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most studies of property tax
regressivity stumble squarely into
the pratfall of regression fallacy. The problem in brief is this.
Income and property are positively related but the scatter of points
is loose, with great individual residuals from any fitted curve, and
a high error of estimate. We want to know which rises faster as they
rise together. The answer depends on which we arbitrarily select as
the ranking variable. Let us say we rank by income on the abscissa
and find the top 10% have 30% of the income and 25% of the property
(a hypothetical number). It looks as though the property tax is
regressive. But now rank them by property on the ordinate. The top
10% are now a different group -we have taken a stratum of points at
right angles to the original column. Some of the humble have been
exalted, and the mighty laid low. This top 10% has say 50% of the
property and 25% of the income, and the property tax looks
progressive (in terms of
income).<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(31)</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the <i>Census of Housing</i>

payments do not keep up with

doubles.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(33)</i></b></small></font> That

difference a technical detail or two can make.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So which top 10% do we mean? Most
studies have uncritically
chosen income as the proper ranking variable, by assumption, thus
practically preordaining the conclusion - and largely invalidating
it. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>On Defining
Income and Wealth</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Dick Netzer, like others, uses AGI
as the reference standard
against which to match the property tax and find it
regressive.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(40)</i></b></small></font> A
certain
citizen in 1970 reported no AGI, but heavy property taxes, which
might make the property tax quite regressive were it not Ronald
Reagan. Yet he is not alone, and it seems harsh to select a measure
that makes the property tax regressive because it is the only tax
many rich men pay. General Oppenheimer has written a fine set of
manuals on how to reach Zero AGI by losing money
farming,<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(41)</i></b></small></font> and
they work so
well that taxable farm income is down to about $3 billions while the
USDA estimates farm income at $14
billions.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(42)</i></b></small></font> I do
not think
that AGI will do.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is not just farming. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Property is the paramount tax shelter</span>.
How does it cover thee? Let me count the ways. There is </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>expensing of intangibles and soil and water conservation, </small></li>
  <li><small>percentage depletion, </small></li>
  <li><small>capital gains rates, </small></li>
  <li><small>deferred realization, </small></li>
  <li><small>non-distribution of profits, </small></li>

  <li><small>multiple depreciation, </small></li>
  <li><small>de facto expensing of capital improvements, </small></li>
  <li><small>deduction of interest, </small></li>
  <li><small>covert write-off of undepreciated land value, </small></li>
  <li><small>deferral of tax beyond date of sale, and many others.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the same time, property is a
large source of income that is not
counted in AGI. Unrealized accruals and imputed income are the most
obvious, and each is a huge item.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus the ownership of property
tends on a large scale to reduce
AGI and increase real income. When we rank by AGI, property owners
move into lower brackets than they belong; non-owners move into
higher brackets.</b> Property tax payments move into the lower
brackets, pre-ordaining a finding of regressivity which is totally
illusory.</small></p>

<small><b>A. Rich and Poor</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are rich jurisdictions and
poor. Professor Tideman's paper
in this conference alludes to this matter in passing. Let us support
his point with some numbers.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In California, you might think
that farm counties like Tulare have
a lot more taxable value per capita than cities, but au contraire.
Tulare
County reports assessed values per capita of $38,100; the whole State
averages $60,000 per capita. Suburban Marin County weighs in with
$95,400;
urban Los Angeles County has $59,000; Orange County has $74,000.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You might also think that
Tulare, being rural, has a lot higher
fraction of land value in its mix, but again, not so. The<b><i> Land
Share of Real Estate Value (LSREV)</i></b> in Tulare County is 28
percent, compared to a statewide mean of 40 percent, and 47 percent
in Orange County. (This datum, and others of like kind, refute the
conventional belief that farm counties are heavy on land in the mix.
On this last point, I must respectfully take issue with my good old
friend Gene Wunderlich, whose paper at this conference suggests that
farm counties have higher land fractions. I wonder if he has perhaps
conflated building values with pure land values? My data, from
California State Board of Equalization, show lower land fractions in
real estate in the purely rural counties of the San Joaquin Valley.)
Grazing and mining counties like Inyo have high values of LSREV, but
they are a small share of the farm economy. (lnyo County, lightly
peopled but heavily cattled, has $136,000 per capita, with very few
human capita (and its cattle are exempt from the California property
tax). Major farm counties with intensive farms, like those of San
Joaquin Valley, have low values of LSREV.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Within counties, disparities among
cities and school districts are
much greater. In Tulare County, one pathetic little povertyville, the
City of Parlier, has just $10,000 of assessed value per capita. Here
are some assessed values per capita from different California cities
in the County of Los Angeles: Lynwood, $21,500; Beverly Hills,
$294,000 (14 times Lynwood); City of Industry, $5,533,000 (257 times
Lynwood).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
is why some critics call the property tax "regressive." It
has given some plausibility to the otherwise bizarre claim that
switching to a sales tax is less regressive than sticking with the
property tax. </span>Within each city a property tax is progressive,
but
<span style="font-weight: bold;">when your data meld cities like poor
little Parlier and Lynwood with
Beverly Hills, you sometimes find poor people paying more of their
income in property taxes than rich people, and getting less for it.
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Switching just the
local property tax to land ex buildings will do
little or nothing to correct such disparities, and therefore make
little progress toward overall social justice, and the wide support
that will evoke. </span>There is, in fact, a natural cap on local
property
tax rates imposed by local particularism: the City Council of Beverly
Hills will not raise taxes in Beverly Hills for the benefit of voters
in Parlier.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To
avoid such regressivity we must work out some formula for power
equalization. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The most
straightforward formula is simply a statewide
land tax.</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>On
this I must again applaud Dick Noyes in NH - not for
what he says, but what he does. What he says is that the genius of NH
is its local control of revenues; what he does is initiate bills for
a statewide land tax.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are many other tax enclaves
and exemptions by which much
property stays off the tax rolls. I have a long list, with about 35
items. Here I'll just focus on two: timber and oil. <a

Tax?&nbsp; The Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax Crusade</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
A University of Alabama School of Law Professor has asked God's
forgiveness for the years she lived in the sin of ignorance about tax
injustice. Susan Pace Hamill, a tax expert, business consultant, and
dedicated United Methodist church goer, thought there was a misprint
when she first read that personal incomes as low as $4,600 for a family
of four were being taxed by the state, while timber owners holding 71%
of the land of Alabama were paying less than $1 per acre in property
taxes. Two hours later she found out there had been no mistake and that
Alabama has the most regressive tax code in the country. Her righteous
rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated onto the national
scene.</small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"As somebody who knows a lot
about taxes, I could not have imagined a
design of a tax structure this bad," she said in a Tuscaloosa News
story last February. "The state's tax code is really horribly unjust
and has no moral, ethical leg to stand on. Period."</small><br>
<br>
<small>Alabamians with incomes under $13,000 pay 10.9 percent of their
incomes
in state and local taxes while those who make over $229,000 pay just
4.1 percent. Commercial property owners pay more than 50 percent of
property taxes, with homes approaching one-third. Alabama's sales taxes
are among the highest in the nation, up to 10 percent in some areas,
and do not exempt even the most basic necessities such as food. The
state's 1901 constitution was written primarily by large landholders to
secure their economic interests, consequently property taxes are
extremely light on their holdings.</small>&nbsp;

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment on Parts of
    the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who Pays New
    York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Except in the implicit recognition involved in their analysis of shifting,
      the distinction between land and improvements was opaque. This is a remarkable
      oversight, because improvements typically depreciate at the rate of 0.5
      to 1.5 percent annually; only land values appreciate.9 And in view of the
      fact that assessments in New York localities have historically been very
      infrequent, one can understand how the land values are in reality a far
      higher proportion of parcel value than assessments would suggest.10 This
      means that in a period of seven years, for example, a property parcel could
      easily increase in price by 50 percent, far more if recent real estate
      market history is to be illustrative. Moreover real estate prices varied
      greatly in their rates of change during this time span; upstate New York
      was largely stable, but downstate localities experienced huge booms and
      busts.</p>
  <p>Recognition of this would tend to favor what is known as the &#8220;new
    view&#8221; of property tax incidence, an acceptance of the idea that &#8221;the
    burden of the tax on improvements remains with the owners of capital in the
    form of a lower net return instead of being shifted to users of property
    in the form of higher rents or prices.&#8221;11<strong> Proponents point
    out that &#8220;the
    tax on improvements is essentially a nationwide tax on capital . . . [and
    therefore] its incidence will depend on the characteristics of supply and
    demand for capital nationally rather than on a single market.&#8221;12 The
    effect of this is to make the tax &quot;highly progressive.&#8221;</strong>13
    Nonetheless, in a small footnote, Messrs. Pomp and Phares elected to go with
    the &#8220;old
    view&#8221; in stating that, &#8220;it seems most appropriate to assume that
    the new view does not apply to the analysis of tax burdens within one specific
    state (underlining in original). Thus, the old or traditional view was adhered
    to in the analysis. . ; that is, the excise effect of the tax was considered
    dominant.&#8221;14 The ubiquity of New York's property tax, and that it has
    over 1,300 local assessment and tax districts, may well have escaped their
    notice.</p>
  <p>This point is significant because the authors took great pains on several
    occasions to emphasize that the New York real property tax was the &#8220;most
    regressive element in the State's tax structure.&#8221;15 In the Executive
    Summary, two of the thirteen bullets stressed that &#8221;the dominant influence
    in the tax system is the local real property tax,&#8221; and that &#8221;the
    local property tax is highly regressive, particularly the owner-occupied
    component.&#8221;16</p>
  <p>This was portrayed graphically, along with an accompanying table, using
    fourteen separate tax brackets showing effective tax rates ranging in a U,
    or a &#8220;reverse J curve,&#8221; from a high of 20.51 percent of income
    for the lowest group, to 3.37 percent for the second to highest group.17
    Nowhere in the Report is there an indication of what income measure was employed &#8211; Federal
    Adjusted Gross Income or Taxable Income, most likely. But it may also have
    been household income. If so, this could well have excluded significant income
    sources, particularly from those households receiving social security income
    and/or retirement income for New York State or local pensioners which is
    not taxable for state purposes. Whatever, this was recognized implicitly
    in the observation that &#8221;many persons are only temporarily in the lowest
    class ($0 - $4,199 for 1980) because of retirement, short-term unemployment,
    and so forth. If their income were measured over a longer period of time,
    rather than on the basis of only one year, they would not fall in the lowest
    class. Thus, the [drastically high effective tax rate] figure for this class
    . . . overstates the true burden on this group.&#8221;18 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>

  <p>Differences among city tax bases are actually, however, extreme. One desperate
      little farm town in Fresno County, Parlier, has just $10,000 of assessed
    value per head. Here are some assessed values per head from different California
      cities in The County of Los Angeles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lynwood, $21,500; </li>
    <li>Beverly Hills, $294,000 (13 times Lynwood); </li>
    <li>City of Industry, $5,533,000 (257 times Lynwood, and 553 times Parlier)
          . </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Destitute Slab City (Unincorp.) in Riverside County has no land values at
    all. (It is an abandoned military base between a bombing range and the fragrant
    southern end of the Salton Sea, with rotting algae and dying fish.) One would
    not expect much support in The City of Industry for a proposal to share land
    as common property with the transients who park in Slab City, which has no
    public services except a species of public schooling, nor would we expect
    the transients to stay in or return to Slab City if they could park on the
    streets
    of Beverly Hills, camp in its parks, attend its schools, and beg or "work for
    food" on Rodeo Drive.</p>
  <p>This is why some critics have called the property tax "regressive." Balkanization
    of the property tax gives some plausibility to the otherwise bizarre claim
    that switching to a sales tax is less regressive than sticking with a property
    tax. Within each city the property tax is progressive, but when your data
    meld cities like poor little Parlier and Lynwood with Beverly Hills you sometimes
    find poor people paying more of their income in property taxes than rich
    people,
    and getting less for it. ... <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_Cannan.html">read
