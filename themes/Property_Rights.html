Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We propose to abolish poverty,
to tear it up by the roots, to open free and abundant employment for
every person. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We propose to disturb
no just right of property. We are defenders and upholders of the sacred
right of property &#8212; that right of property which justly attaches to
everything that is produced by labor; that right which gives to all
people a just right of property in what they have produced</span> &#8212;
that makes it theirs to give, to sell, to bequeath, to do whatever they
please with, as long as in using it they do not injure any one else.
That right of property we insist upon; that, we would uphold against
all the world.</small><br>
<br>
<small>To a house, a coat, a book &#8212; anything produced by labor &#8212; there
is a clear individual title, which goes back to the person who made it.
That is the foundation of the just, the sacred right of property. It
rests on the right of people to the use of their own powers, on their
right to profit by the exertion of their own labor; but who can carry
the right of property in land that far?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Who can claim a title of absolute ownership in land? Until one
who claims the exclusive ownership of a piece of this planet can show a
title originating with the Maker of this planet; until that one can
produce a decree from the Creator declaring that this city lot, or that
great tract of agricultural or coal land, or that gas well, was made
for that one person alone &#8212; until then we have a right to hold that the
land was intended for all of us.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Natural religion and revealed religion alike tell us that God is
no respecter of persons; that He did not make this planet for a few
individuals; that He did not give it to one generation in preference to
other generations, but that He made it for the use during their lives
of all the people that His providence brings into the world. If this be
true, the child that is born tonight in the humblest tenement in the
most squalid quarter of New York, comes into life seized with as good a
title to the land of this city as any Astor or Rhinelander.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>People do not
have a natural right to
demand employment of
another, but they have a natural right, an inalienable right, a right
given by their Creator, to demand opportunity to employ themselves.
And whenever that right is acknowledged, whenever the people who want
to go to work can find natural opportunities to work upon, then there
will be as much competition among employers who are anxious to get
people to work for them, as there will be among people who are
anxious to get work.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wages will rise in every vocation
to the true rate of wages &#8212;
the full, honest earnings of labor. That done, with this ever
increasing social fund to draw upon, poverty will be abolished, and
in a little while will come to be looked upon &#8212; as we are now
beginning to look upon slavery &#8212; as the relic of a darker and
more ignorant age.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I remember &#8212; this man here
remembers (turning to Mr. Redpath,
who was on the platform) even better than I, for he was one of the
men who brought the atrocities of human slavery home to the heart and
conscience of the north &#8212; I<span style="font-weight: bold;"> well
remember, as he well knows, and
all the older men and women in this audience will remember, how
property in human flesh and blood was defended just as private
property in land is now defended; how the same charges were hurled
upon the men and women who protested against human slavery as are now
made against the men and women who are intending to abolish
industrial slavery.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We remember how some dignitaries
and rich members of the churches
branded as a disturber, almost as a reviler of religion, any priest
or any minister who dared to get up and assert God&#8217;s truth
&#8212; that there never was and there never could be rightful
property in human flesh and blood.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So, it is now said that people who
protest against this system,
which is simply another form of slavery, are people who propose
robbery. Thus the commandment, "Thou shalt not steal," they have made
"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thou shalt not object to
stealing</span>." When we propose to resume our
own again, when we propose to secure its natural right to every child
that comes into being, such people talk of us as advocating
confiscation &#8212; charge us with being deniers of the rights of
property. The real truth is that we wish to assert the just rights of
property, that we wish to prevent theft.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chattel slavery was incarnate
theft of the worst kind. That system
which made property of human beings, which allowed one person to sell
another, which allowed one person to take away the proceeds of
another&#8217;s toil, which permitted the tearing of the child from
the mother, and which permitted the so-called owner to hunt with
bloodhounds the person who escaped from the owner&#8217;s tyranny
&#8212; that form of slavery is abolished. To that extent, the
command, "Thou shalt not steal," has been vindicated; but there is
another form of slavery.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;<a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As to the right of ownership, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>Being created individuals, with individual wants and powers, men are individually
    entitled (subject of course to the moral obligations that arise from such
    relations as that of the family) to the use of their own powers and the enjoyment
    of the results. There thus arises, anterior to human law, and deriving its
    validity from the law of God, a right of private ownership in things produced
    by labor &#8212; a right that the possessor may transfer, but of which to
    deprive him without his will is theft.</p>
  <p>This right of property, originating in the right of the individual to himself,
    is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches to things produced
    by labor, but cannot attach to things created by God.</p>
  <p>Thus, if a man take a fish from the ocean he acquires a right of property
    in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by sale or gift. But
    he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean, so that he may
    sell it or give it or forbid others to use it.</p>
  <p>Or, if he set up a windmill he acquires a right of property in the things
    such use of wind enables him to produce. But he cannot claim a right of property
    in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or forbid others to use it.</p>
  <p>Or, if he cultivate grain he acquires a right of property in the grain his
    labor brings forth. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the
    sun which ripened it or the soil on which it grew. For these things are of
    the continuing gifts of God to all generations of men, which all may use,
    but none may claim as his alone.</p>
  <p>To attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership that
    justly attaches to things produced by labor is to impair and deny the true
    rights of property. For a man who out of the proceeds of his labor is obliged
    to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil, all of
    which are to men involved in the single term land, is in this deprived of
    his rightful property and thus robbed.</p>
  <p>As to the use of land, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by
    labor cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession.
    As your Holiness says, &#8220;God has not granted the earth to mankind in
    general in the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they
    please,&#8221; and regulations necessary for its best use may be fixed by
    human laws. But such regulations must conform to the moral law &#8212; must
    secure to all equal participation in the advantages of God&#8217;s general
    bounty. The principle is the same as where a human father leaves property
    equally to a number of children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable
    of common use or of specific division. Such things may properly be assigned
    to some of the children, but only under condition that the equality of benefit
    among them all be preserved.</p>
  <p>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing,
    and gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of
    land is not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend
    their labor in permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor
    is thus expended is needed to secure the right of property in the products
    of labor. For who would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed
    to enable him to reap? who would attach costly works to the soil without
    such exclusive possession of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</p>
  <p>This right of private possession in things created by God is however very
    different from the right of private ownership in things produced by labor.
    The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases when the dictate of
    self-preservation terminates all other rights. The purpose of the one, the
    exclusive possession of land, is merely to secure the other, the exclusive
    ownership of the products of labor; and it can never rightfully be carried
    so far as to impair or deny this. While any one may hold exclusive possession
    of land so far as it does not interfere with the equal rights of others,
    he can rightfully hold it no further.</p>
  <p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement
    divide the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive
    right to his share as against the other. But neither could rightfully continue
    such claim against the next man born. For since no one comes into the world
    without God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his equal right to the
    use of God&#8217;s bounty. For them to refuse him any use of the earth which
    they had divided between them would therefore be for them to commit murder.
    And for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them
    or by giving them part of the products of his labor he bought it of them,
    would be for them to commit theft. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>    To your proposition that &#8220;Our first and most fundamental principle
    when we undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses must be the inviolability
    of private property&#8221; we would joyfully agree if we could only understand
    you to have in mind the moral element, and to mean rightful private property,
    as when you speak of marriage as ordained by God&#8217;s authority we may
    understand an implied exclusion of improper marriages. Unfortunately, however,
    other expressions show that you mean private property in general and have
    expressly in mind private property in land. This confusion of thought, this
    non-distribution of terms, runs through your whole argument, leading you
    to conclusions so unwarranted by your premises as to be utterly repugnant
    to them, as when from the moral sanction of private property in the things
    produced by labor you infer something entirely different and utterly opposed,
    a similar right of property in the land created by God.</p>
  <p>Private property is not of one species, and moral sanction can no more be
    asserted universally of it than of marriage. That proper marriage conforms
    to the law of God does not justify the polygamic or polyandric or incestuous
    marriages that are in some countries permitted by the civil law. And as there
    may be immoral marriage so may there be immoral private property. Private
    property is that which may be held in ownership by an individual, or that
    which may be held in ownership by an individual with the sanction of the
    state. The mere lawyer, the mere servant of the state, may rest here, refusing
    to distinguish between what the state holds equally lawful. Your Holiness,
    however, is not a servant of the state, but a servant of God, a guardian
    of morals. You know, as said by St. Thomas of Aquin, that &#8212;</p>
  <p>Human law is law only in virtue of its accordance with right reason and
    it is thus manifest that it flows from the eternal law. And in so far as
    it deviates from right reason it is called an unjust law. In such case it
    is not law at all, but rather a species of violence.</p>
  <p>Thus, that any species of property is permitted by the state does not of
    itself give it moral sanction. The state has often made things property that
    are not justly property, but involve violence and robbery. For instance,
    the things of religion, the dignity and authority of offices of the church,
    the power of administering her sacraments and controlling her temporalities,
    have often by profligate princes been given as salable property to courtiers
    and concubines. At this very day in England an atheist or a heathen may buy
    in open market, and hold as legal property, to be sold, given or bequeathed
    as he pleases, the power of appointing to the cure of souls, and the value
    of these legal rights of presentation is said to be no less than &pound;17,000,000.</p>
  <p>Or again: Slaves were universally treated as property by the customs and
    laws of the classical nations, and were so acknowledged in Europe long after
    the acceptance of Christianity. At the beginning of this century there was
    no Christian nation that did not, in her colonies at least, recognize property
    in slaves, and slaveships crossed the seas under Christian flags. In the
    United States, little more than thirty years ago, to buy a man gave the same
    legal ownership as to buy a horse, and in Mohammedan countries law and custom
    yet make the slave the property of his captor or purchaser.</p>
  <p>Yet your Holiness, one of the glories of whose pontificate is the attempt
    to break up slavery in its last strongholds, will not contend that the moral
    sanction that attaches to property in things produced by labor can, or ever
    could, apply to property in slaves.</p>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
        paragraph 5) ...<br>
        2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
        (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
        3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
        paragraph 8.) ...<br>
        4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
        paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
        5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of

        and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>

        from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the

    tax on the possessors of wealth, no matter how rich they might be. Not only

    by virtue of beautiful adaptations in the economic laws of the Creator, it
    is impossible for any one honestly to acquire wealth, without at the same

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>NOW, as to the rights of
ownership -- as to that principle which
enables a man to say of any certain thing --"This is mine; it is my
property" -- where does that come from? If you look you will see that
it comes from the right of the producer to the thing which he produces.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What a man makes he can justly claim
to be his.</span> Whatever any individual, by the exercise of his
powers, takes from the reservoirs of nature, molds into shapes fitted
to satisfy human needs, that is his; to that a just and sacred right of
property attaches. That is a right based on the right of the individual
to improvement, the right to the enjoyment of his own powers, to the
possession of the fruits of his exertions. That is a sacred right, to
violate which is to violate the sacred command, "Thou shalt not steal."
There is the right of ownership. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Now
that right, which gives by natural and Divine laws, the thing produced
to him whose exertion has produced it</span>, which gives to the man
who builds a house the right to that house, to the man who raises a
crop the right to that crop, to the man who raises a domestic animal a
right to that domestic animal -- <span

can by him be given or

    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>But that which existed before man came
upon the earth, that which
was not produced by man, but which was created by God -- that belongs
equally to all men. As no man made the land, so no man can claim a
right of ownership in the land. As God made the land, and as we know
both from natural perception and from revealed religion, that God the
Creator is no respecter of persons, that in His eyes all men are equal,
so also do we know that He made this earth equally for all the human
creatures that He has called to dwell upon it.

  (Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a> (1881)&nbsp;<br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...<b>Human Slavery Once
    Generally Accepted.</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>Slavery is found to have existed, as a social institution, in
    almost all nations, civilised as well as barbarous, and in every age
    of the world, up almost to our own times. We hardly ever find it in
    the state of a merely passing phenomenon, or as a purely temporary
    result of conquest or of war, but always as a settled, established
    and recognised state of social existence, in which generation
    followed generation in unbroken succession, and in which thousands
    upon thousands of human beings lived and died. Hardly anyone had the
    public spirit to question its character or to denounce its excesses;
    it had no struggle to make for its existence, and the degradation in
    which it held its unhappy victims was universally regarded as nothing
    worse than a mere sentimental grievance.</small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the other hand, the justice of
    the right of property which a
    master claimed in his slaves was universally accepted in the light of
    a first principle of morality. His slaves were either born on his
    estate, and he had to submit to the labour and the cost of rearing
    and maintaining them to manhood, or he acquired them by inheritance
    or by free gift, or, failing these, he acquired them by the right of
    purchase -- having paid in exchange for them what, according to the
    usages of society and the common estimation of his countrymen, was
    regarded as their full pecuniary value. Property, therefore, in
    slaves was regarded as sacred, and as inviolable as any other species
    of property.</small></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Even Christians Recognised
    Slavery.</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>So deeply rooted and so universally received was this conviction
    that the Christian religion itself, though it recognised no
    distinction between Jew and Gentile, between slave or freeman,
    cautiously abstained from denouncing slavery itself as an injustice
    or a wrong. It prudently tolerated this crying evil, because in the
    state of public feeling then existing, and at the low standard of
    enlightenment and intelligence then prevailing, it was simply
    impossible to remedy it.</small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus then had slavery come down
    almost to our own time as an
    established social institution, carrying with it the practical
    sanction and approval of ages and nations, and surrounded with a
    prestige of standing and general acceptance well calculated to
    recommend it to men's feelings and sympathies. And yet it was the
    embodiment of the most odious and cruel injustice that ever afflicted
    humanity. To claim a right of property in man was to lower a rational
    creature to the level of the beast of the field; it was a revolting
    and an unnatural degradation of the nobility of human nature
    itself.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That thousands upon thousands of
    human beings who had committed no
    crime, who had violated no law, and who had done no wrong to anyone,
    should be wantonly robbed of their liberty and freedom; should be
    deprived of the sacred and inalienable moral rights, which they could
    not voluntarily abdicate themselves; should be bought and sold, like
    cattle in the markets; and should be worked to death, or allowed to
    live on at the whim or caprice of their owner, was the last and most
    galling injustice which human nature could be called on to
    endure.</small></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The World's Approval Cannot
    Justify Injustice.</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>To arrest public attention, and fix its gaze effectively on the
    intrinsic character and constitution of slavery, was to seal its
    doom; and its death knell was sounded in the indignant cry of the
    great statesman who "denied that man could hold property in man."
    Twenty millions of British money were paid over to the slave owners
    as compensation for the loss of property to which they had no just
    title, and slavery was abolished forever.</small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The practical approval, therefore,
    which the world has bestowed on
    a social institution that has lasted for centuries is no proof that
    it ought to be allowed to live on longer, if, on close examination,
    it be found to be intrinsically unjust and cruel, and mischievous and
    injurious besides to the general good of mankind. No amount of
    sanction or approval that the world can give to a social institution
    can alter its intrinsic constitution and nature; and the fact of the
    world's having thus approved of an institution which was essentially
    unjust, cruel and degrading to human nature, only proves that the
    world was wrong: it furnishes no arguments or justification for
    allowing it to live on a moment longer. <strong>... 
  </strong></small></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Justice, Not Vested Right,
    Should Prevail</b>.
    </small><br>
    <small>Some wise and thoughtful men can see no longer objections to the
    abolition of Landlordism now than were alleged not so long ago
    against the abolition of slavery. If the public good demanded the
    summary dismissal of landlords from an important position of trust,
    which as a class, they have so grievously abused, and, on the other
    hand, that they had been compensated for the real or fictitious
    property which it is assumed they possess in their lands, the justice
    of such a course could not for a moment be questioned. Yet I am
    afraid that few prudent, practical and experienced men could be found
    who would advocate the policy of a measure of so sweeping and radical
    a character. Undoubtedly a universal or a general peasant
    proprietary; not, however, the result of a sudden, hasty and
    unnatural change, but the gradual and natural growth of years -- may
    probably be found to be the final settlement of the question of the
    land.</small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Hence the great majority of those
    who have thought the question
    out thoroughly regard the measure known as the "three F's,"
    accompanied with largely increased facilities, and largely increased
    pecuniary encouragement, for the gradual establishment of a peasant
    proprietary, as the fullest measure of justice which the nation can
    just now expect from an Act of Parliament. But on whatever line the
"new departure" may start, it is essential that the eternal and
    immutable principles of justice which determine the character of
    property in land shall in no instance be departed from by the people.
    Ours is a struggle for justice and for right, and we must not furnish
    our enemies even with a pretext to reproach us with dishonest or
    unfair dealing.</small></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Justice of Private Property
    in the Results of Labour.</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>The following are the acknowledged principles of justice that
    have
    a practical bearing on the question: -- </small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Every man (and woman, too) has a
    natural right to the free
    exercise of his mental and corporal faculties; and whatever useful
    thing anyone has produced by his toil and his labour, of that he is
    the rightful owner -- in that he has in strict justice a right of
    property. Any useful thing that satisfies any of our necessities,
    relieves any of our wants, ministers to our comforts or enjoyments,
    or increases our material happiness or contentment, may be an object
    of property, and the person whose toil and labour has produced that
    thing possesses in it a strict right of property.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The two essential characteristics
    of property therefore are:
    
</small></p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>First, the thing itself must be useful for some purpose;
    and,</small></li>
      <li><small>secondly, it must be the product or the result of our
    labour.</small></li>
  </ul>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, the effort or exertion
    demanded by labour is irksome,
    distasteful and repulsive to the indolence and self-indulgence that
    is natural to us and, therefore, no one will voluntarily subject
    himself to the painful inconvenience of labour who is not stimulated
    by the prospect of the remuneration and enjoyment which the fruit of
    his labour will return him.</small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whoever, then, has voluntarily
    subjected himself to the painful
    operations of labour has, in strict justice, a right of property in
    the product or result of that labour; that is to say, he, and he
    alone, has a right to all the advantages, enjoyments, pleasures and
    comforts that are derivable from the results of his labour. Others
    cannot complain of having been excluded from the enjoyment of a thing
    whose production cost them nothing; which be was not bound to produce
    for their use, and which, were it not for his efforts, would not have
    existed at all.
  </small></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Producer's Right of Disposal.</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>Use and exclusion are, therefore, the two essential
    peculiarities
    of the enjoyment of a right of property. The power to dispose of
    legitimate property is almost absolute. Property may be devoted by
    its owner to any purpose he pleases that is not inconsistent with the
    public good and does not interfere with the rights of others. He may
    keep it for his own use and enjoyment if he wishes, or he may
    exchange it by barter or sale for an equivalent in value of the
    property of others; he may alienate it by free gift when living, or
    bequeath it to anyone he pleases, as a voluntary legacy, when dying.
    He might even destroy it and do no wrong to anyone. ... </small><br>
    <small><b>The Land of Every Country the Common Property of Its
    People.</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but,
    having created us, He bound Himself by that act to provide us with
    the means necessary for our subsistence. The land is the only means
    of this kind now known to us.</small></div>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The land, therefore, of every
    country is the Common Property of
    the people of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who
    made it, has transferred it as a voluntary gift to them. "<span

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Q32. Is not ownership of land necessary to induce its improvement?
        Does not history show that private ownership is a step in advance of
        common ownership?</em><br>
A. No. Private use was doubtless a step in advance of common use. And because
private use seems to us to have been brought about under the institution of private
ownership, private ownership appears to the superficial to have been the real
advance. But a little observation and reflection will remove that impression.
Private ownership of land is not necessary to its private use. And so far from
inducing improvement, private ownership retards it. When a man owns land he may
accumulate wealth by doing nothing with the land, simply allowing the community
to increase its value while he pays a merely nominal tax, upon the plea that
he gets no income from the property. But when the possessor has to pay the value
of his land every year, as he would have to under the single tax, and as ground
renters do now, he must improve his holding in order to profit by it. Private
possession of land, without profit except from use, promotes improvement; private
ownership, with profit regardless of use, retards improvement. Every city in
the world, in its vacant lots, offers proof of the statement. It is the lots
that are owned, and not those that are held upon ground-lease, that remain vacant.

      of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Q3. What is meant by economic rent?</em><br>
A. Gross ground rent -- the annual site value of land -- what land, including
  any quality or content of the land itself, is worth annually for use -- what
  the land does or would command for use per annum if offered in open market
  -- the annual value of the exclusive use in control of a given area of land,
  involving the enjoyment of those &quot;rights and privileges thereto pertaining&quot; which
  are stipulated in every title deed, and which, enumerated specifically, are
  as follows: right and ease of access to</p>
    <p> * water, and<br>
  * health inspection,<br>
  * sewerage,<br>
  * fire protection,<br>
  * police,<br>
  * schools,<br>
  * libraries,<br>
  * museums,<br>
  * parks,<br>
  * playgrounds,<br>
  * steam and electric railway service,<br>
  * gas and electric lighting,<br>
  * telegraph and telephone service,<br>
  * subways,<br>
  * ferries,<br>
  * churches,<br>
  * public schools,<br>
  * private schools,<br>
  * colleges,<br>
  * universities,<br>
  * public buildings --</p>
    <p>utilities which depend for their efficiency and economy on the character
      of the government; which collectively constitute the economic and social
      advantages of the land which are due to the presence and activity of population,
      and are inseparable therefrom, including the benefit of proximity to, and
      command of, facilities for commerce and communication with the world --
      an artificial value created primarily through public expenditure of taxes.
      For the sake of brevity, the substance of this definition may be conveniently
      expressed as the value of &quot;proximity.&quot; It is ordinarily measured
      by interest on investment plus taxes.</p>
    <p><em>Q13. What is meant by the right of property?</em><br>
A. As to the grain a man raises, or the house that he builds, it means ownership
  full and complete. As to land, it means legal title, tenure, &quot;estate in
  land,&quot; perpetual right of exclusive possession, a right not absolute,
  but superior to that of any other man.</p>
    <p><em>Q46. Would it not be confiscation so to increase the tax on land?</em><br>
A. What would be confiscated? No land would be taken, no right of occupancy,
  or use, or improvement, or sale, or devise; nothing would be taken that is
  conveyed or guaranteed by the title deed.</p>
    <p><em>Q47. What is the distinction between taxation and confiscation?</em><br>
  A. The sovereign state may appropriate private property of its citizens in
    two ways: (1) by confiscation; (2) by taxation. When one particular man by
    treason or otherwise has forfeited his rights as a citizen, the land and
    houses and personalty of this one man may all be &quot;forfeit to the crown,&quot; while
    the validity and sanctity of 9,999 other men's rights are in no way infringed.
    This is confiscation. On the other hand, when the state, in order to obtain
    the revenue to meet the expenses of government, levies tribute upon its 10,000
    citizens impartially, this is taxation.</p>
    <p><em>Q48. But would it not be an injustice to the landowner?</em><br>
  A. If it be an injustice to tax hard-earned incomes (wages) to maintain an
    unearned income (net economic rent) that bears no tax burden, how can it
    be an injustice to stop doing so? There can be no injustice in taking for
    the benefit of the community the value that is created by the community.</p>

        <small>While land is the gift of nature, certain legal, political and
        social constraints have been imposed in most societies throughout the
        years. Every nation imposes certain public limitations on land
        ownership and use for the common good of all citizens. Four forms of
        governmental control include:
    </small></div>
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1.<b> Taxation</b> --

        which are provided by the government; <br>

        common public uses and benefits; <br>
        3.<b> Police Power</b> -- Right to regulate land use for the
        welfare of the public, in the areas of safety, health, morals, general
        welfare, zoning, building codes, traffic regulations and sanitary
        regulations; <br>
        4.<b> Escheat</b> -- Right to have land revert to the public's
        agent, the government, when taxes are not paid or when there are no
        legal heirs.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><small>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What are the factors that cause
        land to have market value and to
        whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
        market value for three reasons: </small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
        productivity of the soil and natural resources,

        services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
        value of land and 
          </small></li>
          <li><small>the growth of communities and peoples' competitive
        demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that
        people and businesses are willing to
        pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
        period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
        location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
        travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
        businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
        day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.
    </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
        be used as revenue, by the
        community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
        individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
        site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
        have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
        for the period of time. ... <a

    Sermon</a> (1886)<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No man should be allowed to own
        any land that he does not use.
        Everybody knows that -- I do not care whether he has thousands or
        millions. I have owned a great deal of land, but I know just as well as
        I know I am living that I should not be allowed to have it unless I use
        it. And why? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't you know that if

        I am
        not blaming anybody. I am just telling how it is. Now, the land belongs
        to the children of Nature. Nature invites into this world every babe
        that is born. And what would you think of me, for instance, tonight, if
        I had invited you here -- nobody had charged you anything, but you had
        been invited -- and when you got here you had found one man pretending
        to occupy a hundred seats, another fifty, and another seventy-five, and
        thereupon you were compelled to stand up -- what would you think of the
        invitation? It seems to me that every child of Nature is entitled to
        his share of the land, and that he should not be compelled to beg the
        privilege to work the soil, of a babe that happened to be born before
        him. And why do I say this? Because it is not to our interest to have a

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Times have caught up with
        Ingersoll. Ronald Coase, prominent
        Chicago economist, says polluters (whom he calls emitters, to avoid
        bias) have as much right to emit as victims (he says receptors) have
        to breathe clean air. It doesn&#8217;t matter, says Coase, how we
        assign property rights originally: as long as property is firm, the
        market will sort it all out. However, since emitters have invested in
        costly facilities, and property is sacred... you see whither this
        unbiased science is tending.</small></p>

        idea found its way into practice, and today The South Coast Air
        Quality Management District awards "offset rights" to those with
        worthy track records of emitting. New emitters must buy "property
        rights" from old ones.&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Gaffney_BTA.html"> <span

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And yet, the urban price influence
        of Los Angeles extends over 89
        miles east-south-east clear to Temecula and Murrieta and beyond, at
        which point, however, it meets demand pushing north from San Diego.
        Urban valuation fever thus affects much more land than can ever
        actually be developed for urban use. Regardless, most owners come to
        imagine they might cash in at a high price, with high zoning, at
        their own convenience, with public services supplied by "the public,"
        meaning other taxpayers. This is the meaning of "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">floating value</span>."</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If their land is downzoned for
        farming, open space, or habitat,
        they regard it as a "taking," and plead the 14th Amendment. Once we
        buy into the Sanctity (Holiness, Sacredness) of private property, we
        owe them. If we think of the public's buying large quantities of it
        to preserve habitat or open space, the price is already high above
        its aggregate value, and the new demand will push the price higher
        yet.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a case showing how this
        works. The Los Angeles
        Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) needed the old Union Station,
        northeast of downtown in a run-down neighborhood, as the centerpiece
        of its new, integrated mass transit system. With the decline of
        interurban passenger rail traffic, the old station was unused. The
        owners, mainly Southern Pacific, asked more than MTA offered, so MTA
        invoked its power of eminent domain
        and condemned the land. The case
        went to judgement, and in 1984 the court awarded SP an amount about
        twice the going price for land in the area. <i>The court's reason was
        that the coming of mass transit would raise values around the new
        central station, and SP should be paid as much as neighboring
        landowners would be able to get after the station was built.</i></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, land originally <i>granted</i>
        to SP to help subsidize
        mass transit was used instead to obstruct and penalize mass transit.
        Private property had become an end in itself, Holy and Sacred, a
        welfare entitlement, rather than a means to an end. MTA (the
        taxpayers) had to pay a price for land based on the unearned
        increment that its own construction and operation was expected to
        create in the future.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Later, MTA was to stint on subway
        construction, resulting in
        subsidence on Hollywood Boulevard, but there was no stinting on
        paying off SP for doing nothing: the award came to $84.7 millions.
        <b>This is how the 14th Amendment works in practice, making private
        property an end, sanctified for its own sake, rather than a means to
        a higher end. It makes landowners the spoiled children of the
        national family, inflating the cost of every program that entails
        acquiring land. It means there is no chance that the public, whether
        through government or the Nature Conservancy, can preserve more than
        token areas of habitat by buying it: it would bankrupt us.</b>... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Constitutions must be amendable,
to allow for the possibility of incorporating new moral insights into
them. This impinges on the protection of expectations, including those
regarded as property. Protection of property rights is achieved by
constitutional restrictions on the ability of voters and legislators to
reduce the value of property by regulation, taxation or expropriation.
But such restrictions also prevent voters and legislatures from
reflecting new moral insights in legislation, if those insights would
reduce the value of property. There have been times in the past when
moral development has compelled societies to change laws in ways that
reduced the value of property (e.g., elimination of slavery). We cannot
guarantee that there will be no future advances in our moral evolution
that would require similar changes in laws, reducing or eliminating the
value of what we now consider property. Looking forward to the
possibility of such moral advances, we should design constitutions that
permit amendments to reflect new moral insights, while prohibiting
legislators (or voters in referenda) from passing laws that
redistribute in ways not explicitly sanctioned by the constitution.</small></div>

<p>Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>The vanguard group for tax shifters, the
broad environmental movement, conflicts with two American values:
<span style="font-weight: bold;">private property (altho' why absentee
owners need privacy is unclear)
and land speculation. </span>The land tax in particular directly
confronts
these two values left over from the days of westward expansion. As the
PTS wins adherents and looms as a threat to speculators, mortgagors, et
al, the potential losers become vocal.<br>
<br>
While the PTS may seem to pit land sellers versus land buyers, it need
not. Coupled with an untaxing of homes, sales, and income, and with a
Housing Voucher, the PTS could benefit both sellers and buyers.
Sellers, usually of higher income, would benefit more from untaxing
capital. Buyers, usually of lower income, would benefit more from a tax
upon never-produced land, which would lower the price. ... <br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that

earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society</a><br>

stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">How Our Towns Got That
Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Just over a week from now, right
here in Albany, the <b>Property
Rights Foundation of America</b> will hold its second annual
conference. These are the people who are the core of the so-called
"wise use" movement, that is those who believe that the rights of
ownership of real property stand above just about all other values in
political negotiation, and that rights to private property are
gravely threatened by a government that today seeks to encroach on
the foundations of our forefathers' vision of society. In the
American west it is better known as the "sagebrush rebellion." I
won't talk much about whether or not these rights are soundly framed
or well grounded. I will talk, however, about some changes that took
place about a century ago that have had profound consequences for the
directions of American society in the interim. Had those changes not
taken place, it is doubtful whether the groundswell of anger over the
place of private landownership would be as intense as it is
today.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One must start by looking at how
the meaning of the word property
has changed over the course of centuries. In most societies of the
world, as was true in classic western thought, property typically
meant personal property - clothing, household goods, bodily
adornments and armor, and similar such items. Land was typically
owned by society in common, or perhaps belonged to God or nature.
Roman law made some effort to allot land titles to private
individuals and families, but it was honored more in theory than in
fact. Indeed, it was not until the now well-documented "<b>enclosure
movement</b>" in early Tudor England that land titles began their
long transformation from what has been termed "<b>leasehold</b>" to
"<b>freehold</b>." Against the will of the King and his Council,
noblemen seized the land for themselves, marking it into defined
units, fenced off in their names only, even when they had no use for
it. Karl Polanyi noted that:</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Enclosures have appropriately
been called a revolution of the rich
against the poor.<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rutgers Professor of Urban
Planning Donald Krueckeberg more
recently explained how real property became for the first time a
"commodity," much as the market gives personal property exchange
value. Native Americans tied the concept of property not to ownership
but to use. "One used it, one moved on, and use was shared with
others." But the colonists took their notion of real property from
evolving British legal tradition, defined largely in terms of what
its owners could subdue and control against challengers. John Locke's
conception of property was, in one sense, more akin to the Indian
notion in as much as one owned it only to the extent that one "mixed
one's labor" with it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Indeed the most widespread notion
of property ownership,
especially in realms where Roman law had left no legacy, was title in
<b>usufruct</b>, meaning title to use. But that meaning has gradually
given way to the prevailing conception of title in fee simple, even
though legal constraints have grown to curtail abuses of such
ownership and are even seen sometimes as assaults on it. Krueckeberg
notes that as many as nine kinds of property rights have been
distinguished: </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>possession, </small></li>
  <li><small>use, </small></li>
  <li><small>alienation (the power to give away), </small></li>
  <li><small>consumption, </small></li>
  <li><small>modification, </small></li>
  <li><small>destruction, </small></li>
  <li><small>management, </small></li>
  <li><small>exchange, and</small></li>
  <li><small>profit taking.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the first application of
the land law of the New England
settlers there has been a gradual extension of private control over
land titles first to simple use, then the right to benefit, and
ultimately "to the idea of gain made by selling. Land speculation,
which was to spread across the continent, radically transformed New
England's democratic town pattern." Concurrent with this spreading
application of titles in fee simple has come changes in the meaning
of the word property, a term which, although employed in the Fourth
and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, was amplified only
during the second half of the 19th century. The notion of land as a
commodity has had pernicious effects on the course of our whole
civilization. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html"><span

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>Georgists' assumptions
about property ownership rest upon premises
profoundly different from their conventional use in western society &#8212;
indeed increasingly in world society. In the discourse of legal
philosophy, the notion of property and ownership are better understood
as a collection of legal rights and responsibilities among people; for
example, the right to possess, to use, to capitalize, to manage, and to
retain the income from such.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">18</span></small> If
one disaggregates these rights, one has a far clearer understanding of
the potential array of socio-economic arrangements that are possible.
The primary distinction to Georgists is that between ownership for use
and ownership for gain. More will be said about the merit of this
division at a later point, but it should be noted even here that the
distinction is ancient,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19</span></small> and
has had expression at various times in human history long before the
appearance of Henry George. Two sets of contrasting terms are often
employed to distinguish the separate notions of ownership: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>leasehold versus freehold, or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>usufruct title versus fee-simple title.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
In fact compensation for land held in usufruct was far more often in
kind than it was in money. Typically, in Middle Eastern as well as in
Asian societies, a percentage of a crop or of other products gained
from the land were accepted as just payment for its use, paid usually
to a king or nobleman in exchange for services which they in turn were
expected to provide. This usually meant the protection against ravaging
bands, arbitration of disputes, provision of sustenance in times of
emergency, and so on. The pattern of leasehold ownership with either
in-kind services, goods, or later fees paid to lords and kings is the
hallmark feature of feudalism, widely known not only in the European
past but throughout Asia and prehistoric Central American
civilizations. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the Georgist context a
titleholder
has the right to ownership of land in usufruct, but not in fee simple.
As long as an owner uses land and other elements of nature in accord
with the rules and laws of society, one retains a possessory interest. </span>That
interest extends to the privilege to use land for all purposes
consistent with its proper maintenance and care. It extends even in
some cases to the right to preclude others from any trespass at all. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But what it typically does not include is
the right to any speculative gain that would follow from title in
freehold, or the right to use land beyond what it is capable of
sustaining.</span> Use implies that its quality is not diminished for
the future availability of others, and that there is an obligation for
the user to pay to society a just price in exchange for such use. One
had no right, for example, to strip a forest of its trees. Enough is
known now about the arrangements of land ownership and use in
comparative perspective to assert with confidence that the historical
practice of title in fee simple or freehold has been far more the
exception than rule.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small>
Taking the long view of history, title in usufruct has been by far the
more common pattern of ownership of natural resources, except where
Roman jurisprudence and its offspring have spread throughout the world
and come to dominate. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>The authors would further impose the full costs, in the form of
taxes,
on the depletion of natural capital resources. This in turn would both
discourage the improvident use of such materials and encourage their
re-use and recycling beyond what economic arrangements now provide for.
They also argue strongly for tariffs and trade barriers that would
foster linkages between existing local community enterprises, since
they view economic globalization as a &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221; with respect
to the exploitation of both resources (land) and labor. These tariffs
would apply not only to protect the viability of certain social and
political units but to ecological systems generally, so that their
protection would be better guaranteed against the ravages of market
exploitation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>With respect to arrangement of property rights, their
classifications
follow more conventional thinking, distinguishing ownership according
the degree of access and by the extent of public protection warranted.
Here they fall back more on legal and regulatory approaches than upon
pricing. They see a continuum that runs from individual property rights
to common ownership, ignoring the fact that any title to property
constitutes a &#8220;bundle of rights&#8221; which can in principle be
disaggregated and charged for in various ways.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The theme of economic justice runs throughout Daly&#8217;s work,
evident of
course in the title <span style="font-style: italic;">For the Common
Good</span>.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">122</span></small>
But
the formulations of justice are not explicit. One looks in vain for a
statement of what if any entitlements people should possess by virtue
of being human, or what nature or posterity is due in turn. Absent is
anything that Harvard Law professor Mary Ann Glendon calls &#8220;rights
talk.&#8221; <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">123

struggling mightily with these questions.... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>... Reconciles
common rights to land with private tenure</b>
</small><br>
<small>Georgist policy harmonizes collectivism and individalism;
government and the market; common rights and private tenure. It has
been called "commons without tragedy," because it lets common-access
resources like fisheries and open ranges be closed off, without
destroying common rights. The principle is simple and basic. Common
lands, with open access, become overcrowded. Optimal management
calls for restricting entry and usage. Entry is limited by issuing
licenses (or leases, permits, concessions, possessory interests,
etc.). However, instead of giving these away gratis, as is the
current practice, they are leased out annually to the highest bidder.
Thus, those excluded are compensated, while those included get only
what they pay for.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to land already in private
tenure, taxation asserts common
rights to the income of that land, without impairing private tenure
rights. Indeed, private tenure is strengthened when the owner can
truly say "This is my land, I pay the taxes on it." Squatters,
trespassers, and vandals may be evicted with a clear conscience:
their common rights have been protected otherwise, through the tax
system. Thus, the policy reconciles common rights and heavy taxation
with the free market and strong private tenure rights. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In addition, taking tax revenues
from land lets capital and labor
go untaxed. Private property in labor - the basic right of a person
to himself, as posited by John Locke - and private property in
capital, the right of a person to the full value of what he saves,
are strengthened. <span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>2. "Real Property
is Sacred and Untouchable"</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wrong! Suppose this layman writer
and the Oregon Chief Justice
were in error, and water permits were real property. That is out of
the frying pan, into the fire. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>What does 'real' mean, applied
to property or estate? It is not
the opposite of 'imaginary.' No, 'real' is an elided English form of
the French 'regal' taken into English when English kings spoke their
native French. <i>Real property is The King's. </i></b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We threw out kings in 1783, but
not the royal powers. Rather, we
transferred those powers to our State governments. By succession,
real property means government property! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Every landowner is a tenant of the
king or his successors in
interest. <b>The very word 'own' comes from 'owe.' An owner is one
who owes. What he owed historically was fealty to his sovereign.
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That used to mean bending the
knee, kissing the royal foot,
swearing allegiance, and showing up on demand to smite the enemy.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>It has evolved into servitudes
like eminent domain, police
power, the public trust doctrine, and something else that our lawyers
may have glided over, but economists underline: the tax power.
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These concepts are basic to common
law which has been brought into
every U.S. state constitution (save Louisiana's). Moses was not just
whistling Dixie when he quoted The Lord as saying "The land shall not
be sold forever; for the land is mine, and ye are strangers and
sojourners with me." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chief Seattle would have approved.
So would Brigham Young, who
founded the once-independent nation of Deseret on that principle.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Moses was also speaking just as
William the Norman spoke after
conquered England, except that Moses was also a theocrat. "You hold
title to this land from me; observe my rules." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That's the law we have inherited;
that's how the system works. In
one form or another it is found around the world, except in the minds
abstract economic theorists like those of the Chicago School.<strong> ...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>4. "If property
falls, America falls"</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wrong, at least in my opinion.
Property is not an end in itself;
it is a means of getting resources put to their best use for the
general good. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To secure that end, property
rights are instituted among men,
deriving their just standing from the consent of the unpropertied.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whenever any form of property
becomes destructive of that end, it
is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to
institute new principles most likely to effect their safety and
happiness. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consent of the unpropertied?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That means property must work for
the benefit of all, not just
those who own property. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But abolish property!? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That is a red flag indeed, but
note I said alter or abolish, and
it is our own Declaration of Independence I am paraphrasing. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Like Jefferson, I generally prefer
alter to abolish: 'abolishing'
something is nihilistic until we know what we want to replace it
with. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The point is, we have many degrees
of freedom as citizens; we are
not bound body and soul by decisions made, or allegedly made, in the
past.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>6. "You
can't stop
a landowner from pumping on his own land"</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wrong! You can even control his
hunting and fishing there, and
apply police power. As to pumping, it depends on whether he owns what
is under his land. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is oil, we all know mineral
rights are routinely severed
from surface rights by sale, reservation or lease. Water can be
subject to constraints, too. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Limits on pumping water are not as
common or severe as Huey
Johnson and I think they should be, but they do exist. In coastal
areas, pumping is limited and/or taxed to stop salt water intrusion.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Further inland, pumping can be
stopped to control movement of
toxic plumes that destroy valuable aquifers: this is done in the
Bunker Hill aquifer under the Santa Ana River, threatened with
fouling by toxins from Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Pumping is routinely stopped to
prevent 'export' of water from
lands overlying an aquifer: California calls that the 'correlative
rights' doctrine. It is not always well observed, and not often
well-advised, but very well established. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If that does not suffice to stop
overdraft, pumping is controlled
to prorate water among surface owners, and shorten pump lifts. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Also, pumping wells near streams
can be stopped to prevent the
indirect diversion of surface water. This happens on the alluvial
fans that are so common in the west. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A simple solution to half our
tractable water problems would be
a severance tax on water withdrawals. If you can regulate it you can
tax it. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A tax can be viewed as nothing
more than an economic price
charged by the owner of water (the state) for using its property.
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If Chicago-School (and Rand
Corporation) economists were more
consistent in their ardor for the price system, and less consistent
in their anarchistic mistrust of legislatures, they would seize upon
this obvious application of the price system and boost it with all
the considerable influence they wield. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether one chooses taxation
regulation, we must control pumping
in some manner if any system of surface control is to work. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While California rations and
conserves surface water, landowners
in the arid San Joaquin Valley just punch more and more wells into
the aquifers and pump up free water the State keeps recharging at
high cost. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus they play out their destined
role in The Great Water
Treadmill: subsidized water supply followed by overdraft followed by
State rescue projects followed by new overdrafts, etc. ad bankruptcy.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This treadmill got well started in
1913 when Los Angeles tapped
the Owens Valley waters to supply free water in the San Fernando
Valley. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The lands there were timely
pre-purchased by insiders, giving a
clue to the forces behind the premature seizures and diversion of
water. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The episode was dramatized in the
film Chinatown, so the scenario
is often now labelled 'the Chinatown syndrome' although the key names

<p>Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_Megabucks.html">Megabucks
for Negabucks: Solving the Water
Crisis</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The California Constitution and
Water Code, like those of most
states, are explicit that &#8220;The waters of California belong to
the people of California.&#8221; Water is not private property,
evidenced by its not being taxed as such (except indirectly, as it
adds to the value of fee simple land). Water is not, therefore,
subject to the limits that Prop. 13 (and cognate laws in other
states) impose on property tax rates. The State, as owner, can
presumably charge whatever the legislature decides, without its being
considered a tax at all. Water claimants would of course resist
strenuously, with all the lawyers and pawns and media that money can
buy, and social pressure sway, but the public has a strong case.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It&#8217;s not just water <i>per se</i>,
but also the lands under
what were originally <b>shallow waters</b>. Most coastal cities have
increased their areas greatly by filling in shallow waters. The
surface of San Francisco Bay is about half of what it was before
filling began. Boston has doubled its area by filling. Just who
owns the original seabed is a complex legal tangle, but in many areas
the public has basic ownership rights for which it usually fails to
claim market rents. The &#8220;<b>Public Trust Doctrine</b>&#8221;
applies to some shallow waters. In 1983 the California Supreme Court
resurrected it from the dead letter office (Mono Lake Case), and many
cities, with a little positive thinking, could enhance their
shriveled revenues greatly by moving aggressively on these rents.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are four major ways that
individuals and corporations
acquire the use of waters. <b> One is by riparian rights</b>. To own
the bank of a lake or stream is to have a right to the water,
theoretically &#8220;undiminished and unpolluted,&#8221; that nature
put there - subject to the equal rights of other riparians, but not
of anyone else. When waters must be prorated it is in proportion to
the area of backlying land in the smallest undivided parcel that has
ever existed - a penalty for selling off any land. Some riparians
have succeeded in dominating large areas by virtue of owning the
banks of streams. The Miller and Lux empire on the lower San Joaquin
River was a classic case of the 19th and early 20th Centuries.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>Consiglieri</i> for riparians
encourage us to believe that
these rights are &#8220;part and parcel&#8221; of the land title, hence
untouchable, but in fact voters have breached and limited them
severely when they became too obnoxious. In 1928 Californians
amended their Constitution to limit riparians to &#8220;reasonable
use&#8221; (now article 2 of section 10). Oh, yes, it was a big
monopoly power company, Southern Cal Edison, that financed the
amendment, to abet its own heist of a power drop, but still the legal
point was made. When thieves fall out, the public has an
entr&eacute;e.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A second way to claim water is
by owning land overlying ground
water, and the aquifers that store it. </b> For generations,
overlying landowners could pump at will (usually with subsidized
power). Most of them still may, and do, heedless of overdrafts and
falling water tables. When pumping costs rise, the common answer has
been to photograph a wilted field or dying grove for publicity, and
get state or federal governments to pay for &#8220;rescue
projects,&#8221; importing water to recharge the aquifers, as in the
Coachella Valley and the southern San Joaquin Valley. These in turn
lead to more pumping and another rescue project: a &#8220;treadmill
effect&#8221; of long standing. It worked in the San Fernando Valley
in 1913, and it keeps working. The Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California (MWDSC), its Board dominated by land speculators,
is now a big agent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a leading case of 1949
(Pasadena v. Alhambra) the California
Supreme Court did limit pumping from the Raymond Basin. It based
allocations on histories of past use. This led to a statewide
&#8220;race to the pump house&#8221; to establish histories of waste as
bases for future prorationing. It is hard to devise anything so
counterproductive, but that&#8217;s what the judges did (and then some
people blame overpopulation and natural scarcity). <i>The point is,
though, that the State can manage aquifers, and what the State can
manage it can tax.</i></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With the current movement toward
water marketing, landowners may
now &#8220;export&#8221; water from lands overlying the basin being
pumped. This has moved some giant speculators to buy up vast areas
with a view to exporting the groundwater and renting out space in the
aquifers. Some publicized examples are PG&amp;E Properties in
northern California, Peter Hensen and John Huston near Denver, BCE
(Bell Canada), Cadiz Land in Riverside County, Tenneco in Kern
County, a few major oil firms, and the Maurice Strong consortium in
New Mexico. Where natural resources are on the auction block, and
taxes are zero, big money rushes in.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A third way to claim water is
by &#8220;prior
appropriation.&#8221; </b> The key rules are &#8220;first in time,
first in right&#8221;; &#8220;due diligence&#8221;; &#8220;beneficial
use&#8221;; and &#8220;history of use.&#8221; The precondition for
putting water to &#8220;beneficial use&#8221; is owning land on which
to spread it. The &#8220;beneficial&#8221; part is a joke. &#8220;Use&#8221; is what counts,
and &#8220;use&#8221; in practice means
&#8220;taking&#8221; (by withdrawing or diverting). The State charges
nothing for taking its water, and often subsidizes the appropriators.
So the scarce and priceless waters of the west have been allocated
mainly in proportion to prior ownership of land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Part of appropriating water is
securing sites for dams and
reservoirs and rights of way, either from public domain or from
private owners by use of eminent domain. A major case is San
Francisco&#8217;s seizure of the site of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
inside Yosemite National Park. This scenic site on the Tuolumne
River once rivaled Yosemite Valley itself, on the neighboring Merced
River.<i> Rent has been $30,000 a year, fixed since the 1920s. The
Administration is now proposing $8 million a year. However this case
goes, the charge is for the site alone, not for the water or the
power drop. </i> <b><i>San Francisco seized so much more than its own
needs that it sells 2/3 of what it takes to other cities, for a fat
profit that helps keep land values in San Francisco nearly the
highest in the U.S.A., and its housing the least
affordable.</i></b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A fourth way to claim water is
by getting
&#8220;sweetheart&#8221; contracts from large supply systems: Federal
water from the Bureau of Reclamation; State water from the State
Department of Water Resources; and mixed-source waters from the giant
MWDSC.</b> No sooner are these contracts inked than learned
counselors go to work to convert them into perpetual obligations of
the taxpayers and other ratepayers. The original 40-year contracts
that the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation executed on the 1950s at giveaway
prices came up for renegotiation in the 1990s, and only a few old
timers even remembered their origins. <b>Meantime the once-surplus
water had multiplied many times in value, and the contractors were
busy securing rights to resell water that they buy for some $10 per
acre-foot to coastal cities for $200-$500 per acre foot. </b> A
rather shocking decision by Senior Judge John Wiese, December 31,
2003, requires the Feds to compensate the Tulare Lake Basin Water
Storage District for withholding some of &#8220;their&#8221; water to
comply with the Endangered Species Act to save fish downstream. Said
District is a front for the J.G. Boswell Company, owner of 200,000
(sic) acres in the Basin.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What&#8217;s the moral? We can turn
&#8220;Negabucks into
Megabucks&#8221; for state and Federal treasuries by charging water
takers a market price for what they get, instead of subsidizing them
to get it, as now. The stakes are huge; the barriers are
surmountable. Besides raising revenues we would institute a regime
of &#8220;demand management,&#8221; promoting water conservation in the
most economical way. We would solve our factitious &#8220;water
crisis&#8221; and &#8220;revenue crisis&#8221; in one stroke.&nbsp; ... <a

Ethical Land Tenure</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I want to tell you the story of
Charles Avilla. A while back I came
across a book called <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ownership, Early
Christian Teachings</span>. Avilla was a divinity student in the
Phillipines. One of his professors had a great concern about poverty
conditions in the Phillipines, and was taking students out to prisons
where the cooks were the land rights revolutionaries in the
Phillipines. Because they kept pushing for land reform for the people,
they had ended up in jail. So they were political prisoners who were
reading the Bible and were asking the question, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">who did God give this earth to? Who does it
belong to?</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It isn't
in the Bible that so few should have so much and so many have so little.</span>
In the theological world in this upscale seminary he was trying to put
this together about poverty and what the biblical teachings were. He
had a thesis to write and he was thinking he would do something about
economic justice. One of his professors thought there would be a wealth
of information from the church's early history, the first 300 years
after Jesus. So he actually went back to read the Latin and Greek about
land ownership and found a wealth of information about the prophetic
railings of the people in that early time on the rights of the land. ...</small><small>
The Talmudic rabinical discussion is of interest to Georgists because
they tried to allocate the land according to the richness of the soil
for agriculture. For better soil, richer for agriculture, maybe an acre
of that would be allocated. On the poorer soil, these tribes could get
five acres.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The other thing was some lands were closer to the market. Some
land was
closer to Jerusalem. That is an advantage over those who would have to
travel a longer distance to get to the market. How do you have an equal
rights distribution of land allocation with reference to the market
problem? For those more advantageously situated, the adjustment was to
be made by money. Those holding land nearer the city should pay in to
the common treasury the estimated excess of value attaining to it by
reason of superior situation. While those holding land of less value by
reason of distance from the city would receive from the treasury a
money compensation. On the more valuable holdings would be imposed a
tax or a lease fee, the measure of which was the excess of their
respective values over a given standard, and the fund thus created was
to be paid out in due proportion to those whose holdings were in less
favorable locations.</small><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><small>
In this, then, we see affirmed the doctrine that natural advantages are
common property and may not be diverted to private gain. Throughout the
ages when wisdom is applied to land problems, we see this emerge.</small>

<blockquote>
  <p>To illustrate simply, let us suppose a state which has never parted with its
      natural income but is supported by its own economic rent. A farmer wishes to
      take up a tract or [sic] government land in this state and offers an economic
      rent of fifty cents per year per acre in its raw condition. The government
      (i.e., the community) accepts this rent, subject to re-adjustment every five
      years. The farmer then gets his deed without other cost than that of drawing
      and recording the instrument,<br>
      or a nominal price of, say, one dollar an acre.</p>
  <p>He works his new property vigorously, clears, fences, drains and plants it,
      and puts up his buildings and stocks them. He has no taxes to pay, and at the
      end of his first five-year period he is making $10 per acre per year. Will
      his economic rent for the next five-year period be raised because he has prospered
      or because he has invested money in buildings and improvements? Not a penny.
      All the results of his own capital and labor belong to him and not to the community.
      If the neighborhood has not grown much, and fifty cents an acre is still all
      that is bid as economic rent for the same kind of raw ground as our farmer
      originally took, then his rent for the second five years will be the same as
      the first.</p>
  <p>      But suppose that during the second five years something of a boom has set in,
        and a community is growing up. Land is in demand, and for the lessening area
        in the hands of the government two dollars per acre is freely offered as
        economic rent. Now our typical farmer must come up to the market price and
        pay two dollars an acre for his third five years, irrespective of whether
        he is making more or less out of his place.</p>
  <p>In his third five years the boom continues, and the community grows so fast
      that before the close of that period one corner of our friend's farm finds
      itself near the middle of a flourishing town. Five acres of it are needed for
      a public park, and five acres adjoining are wanted to cut up into building
      lots. As building lots, this part of the land will command a voluntary offer
      of a hundred dollars per year per acre of economic rent; and this fact establishes
      the land-value of the adjoining five acres needed for park purposes.</p>
  <p>In this situation what shall our farmer do?</p>
  <p>He has two courses open to him. If he doesn't want to relinquish his land,
      and can afford to withhold it from further improvement, he can pay the hundred
      dollars per acre per year of economic rent which these ten acres will now command,
      and keep his farm intact. If this appears to him too costly a luxury, he can
      signify his willingness to sell to the town the five acres wanted for the park,
      and the other five to individual builders.</p>
  <p>Now, what price should he get for it? He did not pay the government much for
      his title deed, but he has worked on this land for fifteen years, and deserves
      some compensation when he transfers it. By his labor and also, in part, by
      reason of his clearing, draining and fencing, he has been able to make twelve
      dollars an acre from his ground, while his economic rent had not until now
      gone above five dollars an acre. Furthermore, he has built on these parcels
      a barn and two storehouses.</p>
  <p>The method of computing the proper selling price under such circumstances
      would have to be the result of experience, but that price would certainly include
      the present value of the improvements and probably some lump sum besides, as
      compensation for loss of farming opportunity. But just as certainly it would
      not include, (as it would do under our present conditions), the increased location
      value which the town itself has created by its own growth and public works,
      and which in all justice belongs to the town or community and not to the individual.</p>
  <p>      This principle of economic rent applies to all the users of land, including
        mining, use of waterpower, and rights of way over or under its surface. Had
        this principle always been recognized, and the economic rent always been
        retained by the community, taxation would never have been heard of. When
        the economic rent is reclaimed by the community, the need of taxation will
        disappear.</p>
  <p>Let us roughly restate the proposition: All members of the community having
      a joint right to the income which the social advantages of the land will command,
      they are all partners in this income.</p>
  <p>Therefore, when one of their number wishes to take for his private use a parcel
      of this land, he should buy out his partners, i.e., the rest of the community,
      by paying regularly into the common treasury the economic rent of that parcel,
      instead of paying, as at present, the purchase price, i.e., the right to collect
      the economic rent, in a lump, to some other individual who has no more original
      right to it than himself.</p>
  <p>But before this time the reader, unless he has given previous attention
    to the subject, is full of objections to the above doctrine: &quot;How about the
      law?&quot; he is asking. &quot;Hasn't a man the right to buy a piece of land
      as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and hold on to it till
      he gets ready to sell?&quot; The answer is that at present he certainly
      has this statutory right, which has been so long and so universally recognized
      that most people suppose it to be not only a legal, but a real or equitable
      right. A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth of population in
      a
      city, for example, can buy a well-located block at a moderate figure from
      some less far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against
      all
      comers and give it no further attention except to pay the very small tax
      usually imposed upon vacant land.</p>
  <p>Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
      stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police and
      fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently that
      the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times what
      it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the very
      community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its taxes created
      practically the whole value of the land in question!</p>
  <p>It was said above that an individual has a statutory right to pursue this
      very common course. That was an error. The statement should have been that
      he has a statutory wrong; for no disinterested person can follow the course
      of land speculation as almost universally practiced, without feeling its rank
      injustice. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>

          knows no distinction between master and slave, king and subject, saint

          the use and enjoyment of nature; to apply to her by their exertions,
          and to receive and possess her reward. Hence, as nature gives only
          to labor, the exertion of labor in production is the only title to
          exclusive possession. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  rights of property. For a man, who out of the proceeds of his labor is obliged
  to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil, all of
  which are to men involved in the single term land, is in this deprived of his

<p><small>  Weld Carter: <a
 href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html">An
  Introduction to Henry George</a></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Ethics of Taxation </b><br>
  It was but a short step from the ethics of property to the ethics of taxation.
      George's position here was that as labor and capital rightfully and unconditionally
      own what they produce, no one can rightfully appropriate any of their earnings;
      nor can the State. On the other hand, land value is always a socially created
      value, never the result of action by the owner of the land. Therefore this
      is a value that must be taken by society; otherwise, those who comprise
      the social whole are deprived of what is rightfully theirs. Furthermore,
      to charge the owner for this value, in the form of taxation, is only to
      collect from him the precise value of the benefit he receives from society. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to the justice of taxes on products,
    George spoke of "...all taxes now levied on the products and processes of
    industry -- which taxes, since they take from the earnings of labor, we hold
    to be infringements of the right of property."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Of the
      justice of taxes on land values, he said, "Adam Smith speaks of incomes
      as 'enjoyed under the protection of the state'; and this is the ground
      upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly insisted
      upon -- that it is equally protected by the state. The basis of this idea
      is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible by the state
      -- that there is a value created and maintained by the community, which
      is justly called upon to meet community expenses. Now of what values is
      this true? Only of the value of land. This is a value that does not arise
      until a community is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with
      the growth of the community. It exists only as the community exists. Scatter
      again the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would have no value
      at all. With every increase of population the value of land rises; with
      every decrease it falls. ...</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The tax upon land values is, therefore,
    the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only upon those who receive
    from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion
    to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community, for the use
    of the community, that value which is the creation of the community. It is
    the application the common property to common uses."&nbsp; ...<a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"><span

  <p>About ten thousand years ago, human agriculture and permanent settlements

<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    Common Property Is Property Too</p>
  <p>In Dr. Seuss&#8217;s The Lorax, the eponymous character speaks for the trees,
    while his antagonist, the Once-ler, speaks for industry, jobs, and growth.
    Though both characters use clever language, it&#8217;s not an even match.
    The Once-ler has property rights, while the Lorax has only words. By the
    end of the story, the Once-ler has cut down all the truffula trees; the Lorax&#8217;s
    protests are eloquent but futile. The obvious moral is: trees need property
    rights too.</p>
  <p>And why not? Property rights are useful human inventions. They&#8217;re
    legally enforceable agreements through which society grants specific privileges
    to owners. Among these are rights to use, exclude, sell, rent, lend, trade,
    or bequeath a particular asset. These assorted privileges can be bundled
    or unbundled almost any which way.</p>
  <p>It&#8217;s largely through property rights that economies are shaped. Feudal
    economies were based on estates passed from lords to their eldest sons, alongside
    commons that sustained the commoners. Commoners were required, in one way
    or another, to labor for the lords, while the lords lived off that labor
    and the bounty of the land. The whole edifice was anchored by the so-called
    divine right of kings.</p>
  <p>Similarly, capitalism is shaped by the property rights we create and honor
    today. Its greatest invention has been the web of property rights we call
    the joint stock corporation. This fictitious entity enjoys perpetual life,
    limited liability, and &#8212; like the feudal estate of yesteryear &#8212; almost
    total sovereignty. Its beneficial ownership has been fractionalized into
    tradeable shares, which themselves are a species of property.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s nothing about property rights, however, that requires them
    to be concentrated in profit-maximizing hands. You could, for example, set
    up a trust to own a forest, or certain forest rights, on behalf of future
    generations. These property rights would talk as loudly as shares of Pacific
    Lumber stock, but their purpose would be very different: to preserve the
    forest rather than to exploit it. If the Lorax had owned some of these rights,
    Dr. Seuss&#8217;s tale (and Pacific Lumber&#8217;s) would have ended more
    happily.</p>
  <p>Imagine a whole set of property rights like this. Let&#8217;s call them,
    generically, common property rights. If such property rights didn&#8217;t
    exist, there&#8217;d be a strong case for inventing them. Fortunately, they
    do exist in a variety of forms &#8212; for example, land or easements held
    in perpetual trust, as by the Nature Conservancy, and corporate assets managed
    on behalf of a broad community, as by the Alaska Permanent Fund.</p>
  <p>Some forms of common property include individual shares &#8212; again, the
    Alaska Permanent Fund is an example. These individual shares, however, differ
    from shares in private corporations. They&#8217;re not securities you can
    trade in a market; rather, they depend on your membership in the community.
    If you emigrate or die, you lose your share. Conversely, when you&#8217;re
    born into the community, your share is a birthright.</p>
  <p>I recognize that, for some, turning common wealth into any kind of property
    is a sacrilege. As Chief Seattle of the Suquamish tribe put it, &#8220;How
    can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land?&#8221; I empathize deeply
    with this sentiment. However, I&#8217;ve come to believe that it&#8217;s
    more disrespectful of the sky to pollute it without limit or payment than
    to turn it into common property held in trust for future generations. Hence,
    I favor propertization, but not privatization. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">ONE PERSON, ONE SHARE</font></strong></p>
  <p>Modern democratic government is grounded on the principle of one person,
    one vote. In the same way, the modern commons sector would be grounded on
    the principle of one person, one share. In the case of scarce natural assets,
    it will be necessary to distinguish between usage rights and income rights.
    It&#8217;s impossible for everyone to use a limited commons equally, but
    everyone should receive equal shares of the income derived from selling limited
    usage rights.</p>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">INCLUDE SOME LIQUIDITY</font></strong><br>
    Currently, private property owners enjoy a near-monopoly on the privilege
      of receiving property income. But as the Alaska Permanent Fund shows, it&#8217;s
      possible for common property co-owners to receive income too.</p>
  <p>Income sharing would end private property&#8217;s monopoly not only on liquidity,
    but also on attention. People would notice common property if they got income
    from it. They&#8217;d care about it, think about it, and talk about it. Concern
    for invisible commons would soar.</p>
  <p>Common property liquidity has to be designed carefully, though. Since common
    property rights are birthrights, they shouldn&#8217;t be tradeable the way
    corporate shares are. This means commons owners wouldn&#8217;t reap capital
    gains. Instead, they&#8217;d retain their shared income stakes throughout
    their lives, and through such stakes, share in rent, royalties, interest,
    and dividends. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

  <p>The poor&#8217;s claim on commons rent is, of course, no different from
    the claim of middle-income households or the rich: commons rent rightfully
    belongs to everyone. But commons rent, if fully paid, would boost living
    standards for the poor much more than for anyone else. And unlike other forms
    of help for the poor, commons rent can&#8217;t be derided as welfare. It
    is, technically, unearned income, but no more so than dividends received
    by inheritors of private wealth. It&#8217;s property income, and should be
    a universal property right. That, I believe, is a winnable political strategy,
    as well as sound economic policy. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>    We come at last to the inescapable question: What can each of us do to help
      build Capitalism 3.0? ...</p>
  <p>Second, we should demand more birthrights and property rights than we have
    now. Rights that belong to everyone. Rights built into our operating system.
    Rights that protect future generations as well as our own. The reason I stress
    property rights is that, in America, property rights are sacred. They&#8217;re
    guaranteed by the Constitution. Once you have them, they can&#8217;t be taken
    without fair compensation. These protections have greatly benefited those
    who own private property. They should also benefit those who share common
    wealth. ... </p>
  <p><font size="-1">LAWYERS</font></p>
  <p>You are the architects and defenders of property rights. You&#8217;re well
    compensated by private property owners for your labors. Now is the time to
    lend more of your talents to the commons.</p>
  <p>Your job is to design and defend inclusive forms of property that spread
    benefits to as many, rather than as few, as possible. To do this, you must
    play both defense and offense. On defense, be on high alert for &#8220;takings&#8221; from
    the commons &#8212; they happen all the time. I&#8217;m not talking about
    takings by government, but about takings by corporations, which occur far
    more frequently yet are much less noticed.</p>
  <p>Pollution is a taking, noise is a taking, capturing nature&#8217;s scarcity
    rent is a taking. Your first job is to defend the commons against such enclosures.</p>
  <p>Your second job &#8212; the offensive part &#8212; is to forge new property
    rights for the commons. These can be blends, like conservation easements.
    Be creative. Private and common property can often mesh together to the benefit
    of both. Making that happen is your gift. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
