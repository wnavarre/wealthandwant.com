  <p>WHAT is the office of religion if not to point out the principles that ought
    to govern the conduct of men towards each other; to furnish a clear, decisive
    rule of right which shall guide men in all the relations of life &#8212; in
    the workshop, in the mart, in the forum and in the senate, as well as in
    the church; to supply, as it were, a compass by which, amid the blasts of
    passion, the aberrations of greed and the delusions of a short-sighted expediency
    men may safely steer? What is the use of a religion that stands palsied and
    paltering in the face of the most momentous problems? What is the use of
    a religion that whatever it may promise for the next world can do nothing
    to prevent injustice in this? Early Christianity was not such a religion,
    else it would never have encountered the Roman persecutions; else it would
    never have swept the Roman world. The skeptical masters of Rome, tolerant
    of all gods, careless of what they deemed vulgar superstitions, were keenly
    sensitive to a doctrine based on equal rights; they feared instinctively
    a religion that inspired slave and proletarian with a new hope; that took
    for its central figure a crucified carpenter; that taught the equal fatherhood
    of God and the equal brotherhood of men; that looked for the speedy reign
    of justice, and that prayed, "Thy Kingdom come on Earth! " &#8212; <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

  </blockquote>
Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy
Kingdom Come</a> (1889 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Early Christianity did not
mean, in its prayer for the coming of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, a kingdom in heaven, but a kingdom on earth.
If Christ had simply preached of the other world, the high priests
and the Pharisees would not have persecuted Him, the Roman soldiery
would not have nailed His hands to the cross. Why was Christianity
persecuted? Why were its first professors thrown to wild beasts,
burned to light a tyrant&#8217;s gardens, hounded, tortured, put to
death by all the cruel devices that a devilish ingenuity could
suggest? Not that it was a new religion, referring only to the
future. Rome was tolerant of all religions. It was the boast of Rome
that all gods were sheltered in her Pantheon; it was the boast of
Rome that she made no interference with the religions of peoples she
conquered. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> What was persecuted was a great
movement for social reform
&#8212; the gospel of justice &#8212; heard by common fishermen with
gladness, carried by labourers and slaves into the imperial city of
Rome. The Christian revelation was the doctrine of human equality, of
the fatherhood of God, of the brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity.
It struck at the very basis of that monstrous tyranny that then
oppressed the civilised world; it struck at the fetters of the
captive, and at the bonds of the slave, at that monstrous injustice
which allowed a class to revel on the proceeds of labour, while those
who did the labour fared scantily. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That is the reason why early
Christianity was persecuted. And
when they could no longer hold it down, then the privileged classes
adopted and perverted the new faith, and it became, in its very
triumph, not the pure Christianity of the early days, but a
Christianity that, to a very great extent, was the servitor of the
privileged classes. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> And, instead of preaching the
essential Fatherhood of God, the
essential brotherhood and sisterhood of humankind, its high priests
grafted onto the pure truths of the gospel the blasphemous doctrine
that the All-Father is a respecter of persons, and that by His will
and on His mandate is founded that monstrous injustice which condemns
the great mass of humanity to unrequited hard toil. There has been no
failure of Christianity. The failure has been in the sort of
Christianity that has been preached. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Nothing is clearer than that if
we are all children of the
universal Father, we are all entitled to the use of His bounty. No
one dare deny that proposition. But the people who set their faces
against its carrying out say, virtually: &#8220;Oh, yes! that is true;
but it is impracticable to carry it into effect!&#8221; Just think of
what this means. This is God&#8217;s world, and yet such people say
that it is a world in which God&#8217;s justice, God&#8217;s will,
cannot be carried into effect. What a monstrous absurdity, what a
monstrous blasphemy! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If the loving God does reign, if
His laws are the laws not
merely of the physical, but of the moral universe, there must be a
way of carrying His will into effect, there must be a way of doing
equal justice to all of His creatures. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There is. The people who deny
that there is any practical way of
carrying into effect the perception that all human beings are equally
children of the Creator shut their eyes to the plain and obvious way.
It is, of course, impossible in a civilisation like this of ours to
divide land up into equal pieces. Such a system might have done in a
primitive state of society. We have progressed in civilisation beyond
such rude devices, but we have not, nor can we, progress beyond
God&#8217;s providence. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There is a way of securing the
equal rights of all, not by
dividing land up into equal pieces, but by taking for the use of all
that value which attaches to land, not as the result of individual
labour upon it, but as the result of the increase in population, and
the improvement of society. In that way everyone would be equally
interested in the land of one&#8217;s native country. Here is the
simple way. It is a way that impresses the person who really sees its
beauty with a more vivid idea of the beneficence of the providence of
the All-Father than, it seems to me, does anything else. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> One cannot look, it seems to me,
through nature &#8212; whether
one looks at the stars through a telescope, or have the microscope
reveal to one those worlds that we find in drops of water. Whether
one considers the human frame, the adjustments of the animal kingdom,
or any department of physical nature, one must see that there has
been a contriver and adjuster, that there has been an intent. So
strong is that feeling, so natural is it to our minds, that even
people who deny the Creative Intelligence are forced, in spite of
themselves, to talk of intent; the claws on one animal were intended,
we say, to climb with, the fins of another to propel it through the
water. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Yet, while in looking through the
laws of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical </span>nature, we
find intelligence we do not so clearly find beneficence. But in the
great <span style="font-style: italic;">social </span>fact that as
population increases, and improvements are
made, and men progress in civilisation, the one thing that rises
everywhere in value is land, and in this we may see a proof of the
beneficence of the Creator. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider what it means! It
means that the social laws are
adapted to progressive humanity! In a rude state of society where
there is no need for common expenditure, there is no value attaching
to land. The only value which attaches there is to things produced by
labour. But as civilisation goes on, as a division of labour takes
place, as people come into centres, so do the common wants increase,
and so does the necessity for public revenue arise. And so in that
value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the
individual does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a
provision intended &#8212; we may safely say intended &#8212; to meet
that social want. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Just as society grows, so do the
common needs grow, and so grows
this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided fund from which they
can be supplied. Here is a value that may be taken, without impairing
the right of property, without taking anything from the producer,
without lessening the natural rewards of industry and thrift. Nay,
here is a value that <span style="font-style: italic;">must </span>be
taken if we would prevent the most
monstrous of all monopolies. What does all this mean? It means that
in the creative plan, the natural advance in civilisation is an
advance to a greater and greater equality instead of to a more and
more monstrous inequality. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; It may be
that we shall never see
it. But to those people who realise that it may come, to those who
realise that it is given to them to work for the coming of God&#8217;s
kingdom on earth, there is for them, though they never see that
kingdom here, an exceedingly great reward &#8212; the reward of
feeling that they, little and insignificant though they may be, are
doing something to help the coming of that kingdom, doing something
on the side of that Good Power that shows all through the universe,
doing something to tear this world from the devil&#8217;s grasp and
make it the kingdom of righteousness. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Aye, and though it should never
come, yet those who struggle for
it know in the depths of their hearts that it must exist somewhere
&#8212; they know that, somewhere, sometime, those who strive their
best for the coming of the kingdom will be welcomed into the kingdom,
and that to them, even to them, sometime, somewhere, the King shall
say: &#8220;Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into
the joy of thy Lord.</small><small> &nbsp; <a
