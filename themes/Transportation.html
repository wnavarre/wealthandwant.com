        Land Values</a>    </p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE SOURCE OF PUBLIC
REVENUE </b></small><br>
<small>What are the factors that cause land to have market value and to
whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
market value for three reasons: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
productivity of the soil and natural resources, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the publicly provided
services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
value of land and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the growth of communities and peoples' competitive
demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that
people and businesses are willing to
pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent should
be used as revenue, by the
community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
for the period of time. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>ENVIRONMENTAL
PRESERVATION </b></small><br>
<small>It is the responsibility of the local communities to insure that
the market rent of land is collected for public purposes. When a
major part of land rent is not collected, which is the case in most
of the world today, land title holders obtain rights to sell the
value of the public improvements which were made by the whole
community. The community added to the market value of land by making
improvements which increases demand and rent for the land. The longer
the possessors hold the land out of use the greater will be the bonus
they obtain.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>By prohibiting people from using
good land, the possessors force
the premature use of other less desirable land, which is more distant
from the city. This raises the cost of community improvements and the
rental value of the unused, but better located, land. This
precipitates the degradation of the rural environment by using city
land inefficiently -- and creates huge unnecessary pressures on the
natural environment.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A problem that we face is that
cities throughout the world are
spreading out and using land prematurely which is not needed and
should not be used. That is because failure to collect land rent
subsidizes the waste of natural resources and clutters the
environment. Cities that collect the full rental value of land are
more compact and provide greater and less costly amenities for their
citizens.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Any moves to enact good government
principles without collecting
the full market rent of the land may result in a failure. People are
guided by the profit motive. When people can make a larger profit by
doing nothing, but keeping the land they possess out of use for a
long period of time, they will do so. When the community collects the
full market rent of land, they eliminate the motive for keeping land
out of efficient use, because the unearned profit has been collected
as public revenue.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Efficient land use appeals to all
people because it surpasses the
political constraints of most people. Everybody understands that the
earth belongs equally to all people. They want a clean environment on
earth and to leave a healthy inheritance to the future generations,
regardless of their political viewpoints.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The major function of a competent
city government is to provide
good community services by collecting the land rent created within
the community to ensure the efficient use of land and equal
opportunities for all of its citizens. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Transportation
is an important
function of government which would facilitate the creation of a
compact city, where people can easily find the facilities they desire
for education, commerce, religion and recreation. Good
land use, with the freedom of individuals to achieve the highest and
best use of land, would ensure a desirable community. A compact city
would reduce the need to invade the wilderness and devastate the
environment.&nbsp; </span>... <a

      pay a preliminary fine in land values to the man who is putting it to an

      land value, and its owner for the time being is able to levy his toll upon
      all other forms of wealth and upon every form of industry. A portion, in

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<br>
<small>A simple model will serve to illustrate. Presently, rail/metro
infrastructure is almost prohibitively expensive because the windfall
benefits are effectively handed over to landowners. To partially recoup
the outlay, authorities are forced to set fares so high as to act as a
disincentive to potential low-impact commuters.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Enter LVT. Land values enhanced by the infrastructure are
"recycled" by
LVT back into the public purse. This enables fares to be reduced, which
makes the adjacent land more valuable because it now has access to
cheaper public transport. These resulting enhanced land values are
again recycled back to the community coffers, which again allows low
fares which allow more recycled enhanced land values, which allow lower
fares which allow..... While illustrating the process, in practice such
iterations would be bypassed as authorities would cut to the chase and
set the most economically and environmentally desirable fare structure,
which equals the marginal cost of traveling, and not have to dig into
scarce public funds to finance such projects. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But LVT has much more to
contribute to the question of low-impact urban
function, in the form of affordable and efficient public transport and
other desirable infrastructure. </span>The principle reason why public
transport options are presently so limited is because the
taxpayer-funded investment in this and other forms of infrastructure
effectively disappears, in an almost unseen manner, into the "Black
Hole" of landowners' pockets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>That is, not only is the resulting
compact cityscape more amenable to the provision of public transport
(not to mention walking and riding), but LVT makes the investment in
such infrastructure affordable because the resulting enhanced land
values are "recycled" back into public coffers. The extension of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">London's Jubilee line</span>
underground network, which opened in 1999, provides a good case in
point of how desirable infrastructure can be self-funding if land
values are recaptured. An independent study was performed which
assessed the increase in land values extending to 800 yards from each
of the 10 stations. The accumulated gain (to private landowners) was
estimated to be around &pound;13 billion, courtesy of the &pound;3.5
billion of
taxpayers funds it took to build the line! <strong>...</strong></small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><small>Under the current
system, public expenditure enriches private
landowners courtesy of unwitting taxpayers. For example, if a
government invests $millions in a new railway line, the value of land
near the railway line is enormously enhanced. Because the value of this
public investment has effectively disappeared into the "Black Hole" of
private land values, prohibitive rail fares must be charged. But
imagine this: what if we collected some of the boosted land values
through Land Value Taxation (LVT) - couldn't we could lower the fares?
And if we lowered the fares, this would enhance the land values now
that the accessible train service is cheaper to use. Enhanced land
values means more LVT to collect which could lead to lower fares and so
on and so on.</small><br>
<br>
<small>While these iterations wouldn't need to be done in practice, the
above
scenario illustrates how enhanced land values (created by the
community) are recaptured or recycled back to the community. Whether we
build a bridge, a park, a bike track, a community centre or
rehabilitate creekside vegetation - all these sort of life-enhancing
investments also enhance land values, which can be fully recouped for
further projects. This is just one aspect of Geonomics and one more
piece of the unemployment puzzle, but let's now take a peek at how this
tax shift can improve our neighbourhood and lifestyle. ...&nbsp; <a

    Reduce Sprawl </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Public Finance by
    Self-Financing</b></p>
  <p>In the public sector, capital investment in infrastructure projects would
      no longer be a debt burden, because the projects would become self-financing.
      User charges for the public services, when combined with the rental income
      created by these projects, would cover the cost of creating and running a public
      service.</p>
  <p>It was estimated that the BART transportation system in San Francisco produced
      two times more land value than it cost to build. The public recaptured only
      a small part of the cost from benefits provided by land taxes and user fees.
      Most of the cost came from external sources, unrelated sales and income taxes.
      Most of the profits went into only a few pockets.</p>
  <p>Thus, the claim that a community is short of capital is misleading. In fact,
      a community could become self-sufficient in the supply of capital from internal
      sources. But a precondition for this is the reduction of taxes on productive
      capital and labor. Examine, for example, what would happen as a result of the
      elimination of taxation of buildings. This decision, not to penalize people
      who invest their savings in new buildings, leads to the stimulation of a higher
      level of national income, higher saving, and the creation of new capital. According
      to the study made by Tideman and Plassmann (1998, The Losses of Nations, Fred
      Harrison, editor, Orthila Press), shifting taxes off buildings, production
      and distribution, and onto land and natural resources, could increase the gross
      national product by 25%, or one <span style="font-style: italic;">trillion </span>1998
      dollars ($1,000,000,000,000).</p>
  <p>The Land Value Tax Shift from labor and capital is not only a key to reversing
      suburban sprawl and protecting rural environments -- it is a key to realizing
      the dream and fulfilling promises of a truly free market -- with liberty,
    prosperity, and justice for all. ... <a href="docs/Gwartney_Sprawl.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
  Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>The segment of the economy wasting the most
resources is probably
<span style="font-weight: bold;">transportation</span>. Sprawl
exacerbates the need for mobility while
infilling reduces it. Presently, cars claim 50% of urban surface. Land
dues would motivate owners to put their asphalt devoted to cars to
higher and better uses, ones that serve humans. A higher human density
provides mass transit with more riders so that the system could expand
and automobile dependency contract, letting both city and suburb
blossom. ... <br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>Owners paying higher land dues
feel pressured
to develop their land in order to pay their dues, and development is
already blighting many suburbs and farmland. Won't the PTS force
premature or excessive development, losing open space and ecologically
sensitive areas? Environmentalists should understand that development
is actually needed to spare land. Using some land more intensely means
using other land not at all. The PTS stimulates construction in the
most intensely-used locations; compact urban form leaves more
surrounding countryside pristine. Since about one-fifth of urban areas
are vacant or underused land, and half is devoted to cars, there's
plenty of room in cities for growth. While suburban commercial centers
compete with downtown for redevelopment, each new building, whether for
business or residents, must find tenants.<br>
<br>
Higher density is the expected result of the PTS, yet many people
oppose higher density. However, the noxious component is not a higher
density of population but of automobiles, creating congestion, noise,
noxious smells, and danger. The PTS, by clearing out the infestation of
vehicles, makes human habitats more livable and the added people
unnoticeable.<br>
<br>
Without coercion or remote planning, the PTS improves our settlement
patterns. Regulations and zoning, some assume, might be vitiated or
obviated, become obsolete. Instead, the PTS makes it easier for
regulations and zoning to do their job. Since the land tax lowers land
price, buying land for parks and reserves is more easily afforded. The
loss in revenue from removing the newly public lands from the tax rolls
would be offset somewhat by the corresponding rise in value of sites
near the protected open space. Creating green spaces raises the density
of already developed land, and thus its value. Furthermore, land dues
reduce the profit from land development, making it a less attractive
investment, and land use decisions of less economic consequence. After
a while, people with deep pockets would turn to investments that,
post-shift, would be untaxed. Reserving land for recreational or
natural uses becomes less contentious; people could more easily
determine an optimum proportion of green space to developed space.<br>
<br>
Redirecting land rent from owner to government might merely pass the
motive to exploit from owner to state, possibly the next implacable
force against conservation. However, while an individual must use their
own land most intensely to maximize profit, a government must optimize
land use to maximize its land tax base. That is, land value thruout the
jurisdiction is lower when there is border-to-border development;
overall values are higher when some space is kept open. From the
government's point of view, there's more rent to be collected when
highest and best use includes nonuse. ... <br>
</small></font><br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and
automobile. <strong>... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the
public, governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy. <strong>...</strong></small><br>

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html">The Nexus of
Transportation, Economic Rent, and Land Use<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><small><small>Today,
on the other hand, the unearned surplus which classical
economists called rent attaches to monopoly titles -- largely the
scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(2)</span></small> The
surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
rightful entitlement.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of
cities
where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
personal or market exchanges. The land value in New York City is higher
than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
only a minute fraction of the area.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The failure to collect
site rent leads to a distortion in land use
configurations. If patterns unfolded along the lines of both social
preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites would tend to
have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend to be
vacant or have very modest buildings. Consistent with this, urban
centers sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded
by lower-value residential land uses, and still further out would be
farms and forests. The ratio of building to land value, land to total
value (or for that matter any other ratio between buildings, land, and
total values) would be relatively constant throughout a region.
Instead, the ratio of land value to total value consistently tends to
reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient settlement
of land sites is what we know as sprawl.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Rent is Capitalized
Transportation Cost</span></small><br>
<small>There is another dimension to the distortion of land use in
contemporary life. That is the heavy subsidy granted to motor vehicle
transportation services. Estimates are that the typical driver pays
only about a tenth of the true cost of his travel; society picks up the
rest. This profuse subsidy paid to private automobile and truck
transportation further encourages people to locate on sites at far
greater distances from where they would choose than if they had to pay
the full burden of that travel.</small><br>
<br>
<small>From the standpoint of an economic geographer, and for some land
economists, land rent is simply capitalized transportation cost. Land
rent is the surplus generated by social activity on or in the vicinity
of locational sites which accrues to titleholders of those parcels.
Whether or not it is recaptured by public policy, rent is a natural
factor deriving from the intensive use of natural capital. More
intensive use of high value landsites leads to site configurations that
are less dependent upon transportation services. People can access them
easily even by walking. One must remember that transportation is not an
end in itself but rather a means. This is something often forgotten
even by urban planners, the distinction between accessibility and
mobility.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Rent and Transportation
Costs
Linked</span></small><br>
<small>Higher density development has all the economies of scale,
savings in
cost, reduction in externalities, dividends in community and political
enhancement, and benefits to urban areas that we all say that we want.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The greater the proximity to points of
desirable accessibility, the
lower are typically the transportation costs. Conversely, sites remote
from the urban centers of greatest locational value will have higher
transportation costs.&nbsp; ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>This relationship has
been demonstrated more empirically in a recent
study by the Urban Land Institute. The author concluded that, for
Portland Oregon,</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <p><small>each additional mile [traveled]
  translated into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in
  locations command a premium, those farther out save money. A ten-mile
  difference, all other things being equal, would amount to about $56,000
  in new home value.</small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>For a household in which one
worker
drives downtown (or at least to a more central location) to work, that
ten-mile difference may amount to 4,600 miles annually, assuming 230
days of commuting and a round-trip of 20 miles each day. Moreover, if
non-work trips to the central area and elsewhere doubled that amount,
the tradeoff would be about 9,000 miles annually, which could mean a
higher/lower driving cost of $3,000 annually, not counting the time
saved/spent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(7)
</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><strong><em>That's the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten
miles</em></strong>.
If the urban resident has to rely upon a car nonetheless, subtracting
some $3,000 annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again
that much, and likely more, to own a car. Seven years ago James
Kunstler put the true costs along with other experts at about $6,100
annually.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(<small>8</small>)</span>
The American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000
miles in 2001 cost 51&cent; per mile or $7,650.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(9)</span></small> Even
that figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not those passed
on to society. One study calculated that the total costs of motor
vehicle transportation to our society equal approximately one-fourth of
our Gross Domestic Product (GDP)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.(10)</span></small> In
1991 road user fees totaled only about $33 billion whereas the true
costs to society were ten times that;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(11)</span></small> put
another way, drivers paid only 10% of the true costs of their motor
vehicle use.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(12)</span></small>
<strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Public opinion polls are practically unanimous in their
demonstration
of the kind of environment most Americans say they would like to live
in.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(16)</span></small>
Sociological studies have documented graphically how alienating the
car-dependent environment really is. There is an inverse correlation
between the ability of a street to move and to park cars and trucks,
and the amount of social interaction between neighbors on that street.
One study two decades ago compared three similar residential streets in
San Francisco, with different levels of traffic volumes. Residents on
the different streets were asked to indicate on the base maps of their
streets where friends and acquaintances lived. Those living on streets
with the least traffic volume had three times as many friends and twice
as many acquaintances as those living on the streets with heavy traffic
volumes<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.(17)</span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(18)</span></small>
More recently Harvard Professor Robert Putnam has made similar findings
in his book Bowling Alone, and concluded that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">every ten minutes of
additional commuting time means ten percent less time devoted to
communal activity. Driving is no longer regarded as fun, not on today's
typically congested highways. </span>There was a time when most people
drove
cars for pleasure; today people resent their having to drive so much
and often see driving as a burden.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(19)</span></small> It
is also no accident also that on measures of livability, those
locations regarded as most attractive are also the ones that are most
bicycle-friendly.<small><span

are only a few such examples.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(21)</span></small> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But
despite their vague discomfort people typically lack the perspicacity
to incorporate these non-pecuniary costs into their decisions about
locational choice. ...</span></small><br>

<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting Distortions by Pricing:
Increasing the Collection of Land Rent</span></small><br>
<small>Recovering the economic rent from urban parcels helps people to
appreciate the true costs of the transportation versus location
trade-off. It brings the carrying costs of site choices back to the
present time and makes them comparable with travel choices. The payment
of site rent becomes an operating cost. The other corrective policy
needed is to raise transportation costs to a level commensurate with
their full value as private goods. Transportation user fees, in the
form of motor fuel taxes, green taxes, congestion fees, and
administrative costs (for the administration of drivers' licenses and
registration fees) could easily provide the needed price corrections to
bring into balance marginal transportation costs and land rent
collection. Doing so would equilibrate choices between people living
and working in high rent urban centers and those in peripheral low rent
(but higher travel cost) locales.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Figure 2 shows how a tax on land value (or alternatively the tax
on
land rent) coupled with the proper design of transportation fees can
equilibrate the competitive advantage of markets in urban areas
relative to suburbs, thereby reducing, and perhaps even reversing, the
centrifugal forces of sprawl development. The land tax cannot alone
redress the problem, especially so long as such inordinate social
subsidies are granted to private motor vehicle transportation services.
Nor can transportation fees, raised to a level fully commensurate with
the social and private costs they incur, alone ensure that the price of
locations will be matched. But to the extent that both are assessed,
they reach far toward correcting this disequilibrium. One could even
argue that all site rent should be recaptured by society and that all
transportation costs that are identifiable as consumption of private
goods should be priced accordingly. Some advocates even suggest that
doing so will not only foster economic efficient behavior but also
provide sufficient revenue for a citizen's dividend consistent with
economic justice. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting Distortions by
Pricing:
Increasing the Recovery of Transportation Service Costs</span></small><br>
<small>With respect to charges upon transportation services and
externalities,
there are several components to a proper pricing design.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(25)</span></small> The
first step to proper pricing is to identify the proportion of
transportation services that ought rightly to be seen as private goods
as opposed to public goods.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(26)</span></small>
Although this is a daunting task, the frequent figure used is 80
percent - 20 percent proportion. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The public good proportion of road use
reflects the amount of reliance by services provided by the government
and associated agencies like mail service, national defense, public
safety (ambulance, police and fire departments), and so on. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The private
use of the roads constitutes the overwhelming amount of its use. This
means that as a rule 80 percent of the highway use charges should be
paid by individual drivers, directly or indirectly. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is easy to
distinguish five elements of transportation service cost: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>capital
investment, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>maintenance costs, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>regulation costs, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>environmental
externalities and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>congestion costs. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Each of these calls for a
different
treatment with respect to revenue design.</small><br>
<br>
<small> <strong>...</strong> capital
investments affect the market value of
locational sites by conveying rent to those in any way benefitting from
the service. That rent accruing to proximate sites and can easily
recaptured to pay off the debt service of project construction.
Typically rent collection is ignored, however, left instead in the
hands of titleholders whose sites are serviced by the infrastructure
investment. This drives speculation in land, with all the negative
effects it brings both economically and politically. In fact the rent
created by capital investment in transportation can be enormous. </small><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One nine-mile
stretch
of interstate highway in Albany, New York, costing $125 million to
construct has yielded $3.8 billion in increased land values within just
two miles of its corridor in the 40 years of its existence.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(27)</span>
This is a thirty-fold return in a timespan typically used for bond
repayment! </small>    </small></li>
  <li><small>The Washington Metro created increments in land value
along much
of the 101-mile system under of construction in 1980 that easily
exceeded $3.5 billion, compared with the $2.7 billion of federal funds
invested in Metro up until that time.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(28)</span> No
doubt the return is far greater today. </small>    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The component of transportation
costs constituting capital expenditure
can and should be recaptured through the collection of land rent since
it accounts for the creation of that value particular to proximate
locational sites.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Maintenance costs on the other hand are best paid for from user
fees,
and can range from excise taxes on motor fuel, tires, heavy truck
charges and others still.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Separate from maintenance operations are the costs involved in
the
regulation and supervision of drivers and motor vehicles themselves.
License and registration fees should ideally be designed only to
recover the costs involved in their administration.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small>Charging for pollution
externalities of motor vehicle travel invites
more complex issues. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small>The last dimension of
motor vehicle transportation charges can be designed to reflect the
costs of congestion. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>These pricing approaches taken together offer the prospect of
both
recovering costs in their varied forms as well as fostering efficient
transportation services. There are grave misconception in how much
fiscal policies distort social and economic behavior. And the fiscal
policies that foster the greatest distortions of all are those
involving road costs and the failure to collect economic rent. Rather
than resort to traditional command-and-control approaches which are
frequently just as cumbersome and distorting as current unthinking
fiscal measures, now is an opportune time to consider models which will
help us to get things right. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to understand how closely linked transportation costs and
      land costs are. There are fixed costs involved in locating a home or a business
      in either place: the costs of building a home, office, or factory and the costs
      of purchasing a car or a truck. Leaving those costs aside for the moment, consider
      the relationship between the variable operating costs due to locating in an
      urban center versus those in locating at the periphery ... </p>
  <p>Figure 10.1 shows that a household or business is likely to incur costs by
      locating at either site, whether at a city's center or at the city's edge.
      At a center site, the costs will take the form of higher land rent; at the
      city's edge, the costs will be transportation related. If this is not readily
      apparent, it is because society provides subsidies to titleholders and travelers
      beyond what are directly experienced or understood.</p>
  <p><strong>Transportation Costs</strong></p>
  <p> Consider first the costs of transportation in remote areas; such costs
    are necessarily higher. The way in which geographers and some land economists
    understand
      transportation is by using the terms &quot;<strong>accessibility</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>mobility</strong>.&quot; ...</p>
  <p>... We do an awful lot of driving just to do what we need to do. This is because
      transportation engineers and land use planners have confused two fundamental
      concepts: access and mobility.</p>
  <p>By confusing these two principles, we spend an inordinate amount of money
      on transportation services, most of it on roads and highways. One 1993 study
      calculated that the total costs of motor vehicle transportation to our society
      equal approximately a fourth of our gross domestic product (GDP).<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> The
      study concluded that &quot;when the full range of costs of transportation
      are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the American public
      a total
      of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. Just the costs of automobile crashes
      represents a figure equal to 8 percent of the American GDP.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4]</em></strong></font> Japan,
      by way of comparison, spends an estimated 10.4 percent to satisfy all its transportation
      requirements, although the figure might be a bit low because not all externalities
      are included in the calculation.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5] </em></strong></font>Road
      user fees in 1991 totaled only about $33 billion, whereas the true costs to
      society were ten times that;<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> put
      another way, drivers pay only 10 percent of the true costs of their motor vehicle
      use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[7] </em></strong></font>The balance is paid
      by society, effectively subsidizing highway use by paying for all but the marginal
      out-of-pocket operating costs.</p>
  <p>The relationship between transportation costs and land values can be made
      even clearer by empirical study of how land values increase as one moves toward
      the center of the city. In an investigation for the Urban Land Institute, the
      author concluded that, for Portland, Oregon, each additional mile [traveled]
      translated into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in locations
      command a premium, those farther out save money. A ten-mile difference, all
      other things being equal, would amount to about $56,000 in new home value.</p>
  <p> For a household in which one worker drives downtown (or at least to a more
      central location) to work, that ten-mile difference may amount to 4,600 miles
      annually, assuming 230 days of commuting and a round-trip of 20 miles each
      day. Moreover, if non-work trips to the central area and elsewhere doubled
      that amount, the tradeoff would be about 9,000 miles annually, which could
      mean a higher/lower driving cost of $3,000 annually, not counting the time
      saved/spent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8]</em></strong></font></p>
  <p>Such are the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten miles. If
      the urban resident has to rely on a car nonetheless, subtracting some $3,000
      annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again that much (and likely
      more) to own a car. Author James Kunstler put the true costs along with other
      experts at about $6,100 annually seven years ago.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9]</em></strong></font> The
      American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000 miles in
      2001 cost 51 cents per mile, or $7,650.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[10]</em></strong></font> This
      figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not the additional costs passed
      on to society.</p>
  <p>The latter figures include externalities such as pollution and the costs of
      highway crashes. Hortatory public pleas for people to tune up their engines
      so that they pollute less, to inflate tires properly, and to drive more safely
      are not likely to change the reality that people are forgetful and fallible.
      Pollution-free cars are not available; people must drive to participate in
      this society. The consequences of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and ozone
      are no longer a matter of debate; they are scientific fact. Despite frequent
      headlines about replacing the internal combustion engine, all the realistic
      substitutes also ultimately rely on fossil fuel power, solar-powered cars are
      far in the future, if at all, and also fail to deal with any transition. And
      every person driving his or her own car multiplies the probabilities of accidents.
      When people step into a car, they are seldom mindful of such odds. Yet if the
      direct pecuniary costs of driving increase in any substantial way, there will
      surely be significant changes in the trade-offs involved in housing/transportation
      choices. As will be made clear later, making costs visible and linking them
      to private personal behavior is one way to ensure that transportation pays
      its own way. ...</p>
  <p>Sooner than Americans are likely to bear the real burden of global warming's
      environmental consequences, they are likely to experience the onset of price
      rises for petroleum. Experts are divided, but among those best insulated from
      the pressures of bias, there is increasing consensus that the peak of oil extraction

      prices will not induce greater supply; it will not change the fact that the
      world will have passed the point of most easily extracted oil and will enter
      a long and increasingly steep period of declining availability. It is rather
      a matter of physics: When it costs more in energy to bring oil from deep in
      the earth than what can be extracted, it is not worth the investment. Even
      the greater wealth of American society will not insulate it from world competition
      over what is a limited and fungible commodity. How this alters the calculations
      Americans make about where to live and work will increasingly depend on the
      price they are willing to pay for transportation service. ...</p>
  <p>Just as recovering the costs of transportation service equilibrates costs
      and benefits on one side of the equation, recovering the economic rent accruing
      to land value facilitates efficient space configurations on the other side.
      Figure 10.2, again conceptually, portrays how the collection of various transportation
      user fees as well as the recovery of land rent corrects the economic distortions
      that today result in sprawl development. The shaded area indicates the pricing
      correctives necessary to ensure that neither urban nor rural land sites are
      disadvantaged in travel or location choices that individuals make for either
      residential or commercial purposes.</p>
  <p>As it happens, collecting land rent is a relatively simple operation: It involves
      a small computer adjustment in the assessment base of what is now the local
      real property tax. The real property tax to an economist is really two separate
      taxes: that put on land value and that put on improvement values. A gradual
      phaseout of the tax on the improvement component, shifting totally to a tax
      on the land, recovers economic rent in a way that satisfies all the principles
      of sound tax theory.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[35]</em></strong></font> It
      is efficient, neutral, equitable, administrate, stable, and simple. It is also
      absolutely foolproof: One cannot hide land or take it to a remote tax haven.
      It relieves poor households (who typically own no land) of any tax burden and
      rewards those titleholders who use their sites efficiently. High-value sites
      are induced to construct high-value improvements, and low-value sites are left
      alone. In this way, central locations, where commercial enterprises typically
      locate, pay according to their intensity; home owners, who typically locate
      at the periphery of a neighborhood community, pay moderately; and agricultural
      land and forestlands pay little if anything. <strong>By an automatic and natural
      process, the centrifugal forces of sprawl development are reversed, and investment
      is
      encouraged in core locales. The higher density resulting affords the necessary
      ten to twelve households per acre (or the commercial equivalent) that makes
      public transportation service economically viable, lessening the prospect of
      automobile dependency</strong>.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[36] </em></strong></font>... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Costs of Poor
Taxes</b>
</small><br>
<small>Society pays a price for not adopting taxes which follow the
principles developed over the centuries. Here I want only to show how
the resulting distortions that arose in the use of land ultimately
caused the railroads to fail in being able to serve society. While in
the short term the railroads certainly saved themselves from having
to pay taxes on their vast land holdings, the most valuable of which
were right around their own investment in tracks and stations, they
ultimately lost the frequency of traffic which that tax structure
would have induced. This is because the population and improvement
densities needed to make public transit traffic economically viable
did not come about. Taking the long view of society, George Kennen
notes in one of his books that:</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>The railway. . . was
capable of accepting and disgorging
its loads, whether of passengers or freight, only at fixed points. This
being the case, it tended to gather together, and to concentrate around
its urban terminus and railhead, all activity that was in any way
related to movements of freight or passengers into or out of the city.
It was in this quality that it had made major and in some ways decisive
contributions to the development not only of the great railway
metropolises of the Victorian age particularly of such inland cities as
Moscow, Berlin, Paris, and Chicago but even certain of the great
maritime turnover ports, such as London and New York.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The automobile, on the other hand,
had precisely the opposite
qualities. Incapable, in view of its own cumbersomeness and
requirements for space, of accepting or releasing large loads at any
concentrated points anywhere, but peculiarly capable of accepting and
releasing them at multitudes of unconcentrated points anywhere else,
the automobile tended to disintegrate and to explode all that the
railway had brought together. It was, in fact, the enemy of the
concentrated city. Thus it was destined to destroy the great densely
populated urban centers of the nineteenth century, with all the
glories of economic and cultural life that had flowed from their very
unity and compactness. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Transportation planners know that
public transit typically takes a
density of at least 8-10 households per acre in order for it to be
economically viable. Because tax policies have been instituted that
have the effect of deliberately fostering low density suburban
sprawl, society has become dependent upon motor vehicle
transportation rather than transit service. Had taxes been imposed
heavily or solely upon land value, just the opposite would have
occurred: development would have been most intense on the high
land-value parcels, right by the transit services, making our society
less dependent upon motor vehicles.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We face a far greater problem on
account of the way in which
America has allowed its landscape to be configured than most people
today realize. Over-reliance upon the car causes inefficiencies in
transportation patterns and thereby disenfranchises the poor, the
disabled, the young and the old from their right to mobility. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">One
1993 study concludes that "when the full range of costs of
transportation are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the
American public a total of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. This is
equal to about one-quarter of the annual GNP and is greater than our
total national annual expenditure on either education or health."
</span>Just the costs of motor vehicle accidents nothing else
represents a
figure equal to 8 percent of the American Gross Domestic Product.
Conventional American land use configurations and the automobile
dependent lifestyle that goes with it sap our resources and what
effort could be used for other ventures and activities. Since so much
of this activity is consumption and not production, it weakens
America's world economic position and precludes reinvestment in more
productive areas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Because of the way
in which we have encouraged
development, people who need jobs are frequently too poor to own the
cars necessary to get to them.</span>&nbsp;

</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... near me is a beautiful
parkway which runs about 40 miles. For most of
its length, it is a rather straight highway. But near its western end,
the straight road has some huge curves, designed to take it around some
properties which the builders of the highway did not seek to acquire
via eminent domain after the owners chose not to sell. Every driver who
uses the westernmost section of the Merritt Parkway must drive extra
miles in order to protect those wealthy 1930s landholders and their
successors. I estimate that at least 1.3 billion extra miles have been
driven by the general public. Had the builders of the parkway exercised
eminent domain, this mileage, and the pollution and expense involved,
would have been saved. Instead, the costs are shifted onto every driver
and onto the taxpayers who maintain the highway and its services.
Eminent domain would, I think, have been an appropriate step to prevent
that. Today, the properties are among the most valuable residences in
Connecticut, but their owners don't compensate the rest of us for our
inconvenience and expense.&nbsp; ... <a

Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>So also in the case of
the auctioning of &#8220;pollution credits&#8221; or
tradeable permits, what in fact constitute the right of power
industries to treat the air as a dump to the full extent which
environmental tolerances allow.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span></small> These
&#8220;credits&#8221; are now &#8220;owned&#8221; by the private sector and traded back and
forth among corporations, even though all people experience the
consequences of its treatment. Airport landing slots, &#8220;prime time&#8221;
broadcasting, and many other time-sensitive dimensions have all been
handed over to the private sector with nominal benefit to the public.
London Mayor Ken Livingstone has been a strong supporter of renting the
landing slots at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports, and is at this very
time exploring a rent recovery scheme to pay for the upgrade of
components of the Jubilee tube line.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">46 ...</span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>The
collection of land rent has other consequences for the smooth and
effective functioning of the economy as well. With respect to the
configurations of land use in urban areas, the collect of land rent
neutralizes, and even reverses, the centrifugal forces which the
current real property tax (i.e. that on both land and improvements)
exerts on the values of locational sites. In fact one eminent economist
argues that a tax on land sites is &#8220;better than neutral,&#8221; because it
fosters activity in the highest value areas and removes the factor of
adverse timing that often stalls economic investment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">51</span></small> This
all leads to the economic vitality of high-land-value cities, simply by
virtue of concentrating activity in central areas instead of peripheral
and remote regions. It discourages the extravagant and careless
development of land sites,
thereby also fostering development densities conducive to community
welfare and to the success of public transit services.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">52</span></small>
Experts agree that the minimum density necessary to make public transit
services economically viable is 10 to 12 households per acre; without
this, there is little prospect of altering private automobile
dependency.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">53</span></small>
And given the widespread environmentally and socially destructive
consequences of motor vehicle dependency, collecting rent is half the
answer toward the goal of engendering livable urban areas. (The other
half &#8212; see below &#8212; is pricing motor vehicle use at its true marginal
cost to society.)</small></div>
<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The more cohesive the
development of communities is, the greater the
synergy exists among its members. Sprawl development not only increases
the cost of transportation and other infrastructure needed to service
these sites, it also reduces the extent to which people are accessible
to one another. There is considerable indication that American society
is losing this elusive quality of community. When Harvard professor
Robert Putnam published his celebrated article <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Bowling Alone</span> in January, 1995, it
was remarkable as much for the resonance that it generated throughout
the nation as for the message itself. David Broder of the Washington
Post pronounced <span style="font-style: italic;">Bowling Alone</span>
the most important academic article that year. Putnam argued that our
communal relationships are declining, and that an ever smaller
proportion of the population is involved in social activities of a
cooperative and communal nature.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">54</span></small> We
used to be a nation of joiners; increasingly now we&#8217;re a nation of
loners. As Tocqueville noted 150 years ago, affiliative groups used to
be the unique strength of American society.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">55</span></small>
Several hypotheses were offered in this and subsequent studies to
explain the decline in the civic engagement of Americans &#8212; various
demographic changes, technological innovations such as television, the
changing role of government, the cultural revolution, and so on. The
land-use and transportation patterns that have evolved in the post-war
period are a factor as well. The concepts of neighborhood and community
today no longer mean the same thing as they
did in the past.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Recent days have witnessed a
profound and growing awareness of the problems due to sprawl
development. In fact one opinion poll marked sprawl as the highest
current concern among American voters.60 The answers being offered,
however, don&#8217;t address the root causes of the problem. The most talked
about panacea is the institution of urban growth boundaries, but these
have failed to be demonstrably successful even in the two communities
most often cited (Portland and Boulder) where they were instituted over
twenty years ago. Solutions such as these reflect the penchant of
policy makers to rely upon so-called &#8220;command-and-control&#8221; (CAC)
approaches to government rather than &#8220;pricing&#8221; approaches. The
extension of government reach and weight to impose policies deemed
appropriate is burdensome, expensive, and inefficient.</small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>Such means reflect a lack
of understanding and imagination according to
authors David Osborne and Ted Gaebler, who urge adoption policies of
&#8220;steering rather than rowing.&#8221; <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">62</span></small> As
long as drivers personally are able to pass off to others the true
costs of their travel, it guarantees, along with the failure to collect
land rent, that sprawl development will continue. One 1993 study
concluded that "when the full range of costs of transportation are
tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the American public a
total of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. This is equal to about
one-quarter of the annual GNP and is greater than our total national
annual expenditure on either education or health."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">63</span></small>
Japan, by way of comparison, spends an estimated 10.4% to satisfy all
its transportation requirements, although the figure might be a bit low
because not all externalities are included in the calculation.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">64</span></small> One
reason we are spending so much on motor vehicle transportation is that
our public policies encourage it. Road user fees represented about $33
billion in 1991 but the true costs to society were ten times that;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">65</span></small> put
another way, drivers pay only 10% of the true costs of their motor
vehicle use.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">66</span></small>...
