  <p>You may not have thought about the injunction &quot;thou shalt not steal!&quot; as relating
      to how society functions and how our laws and taxes are arranged, but Henry
      George and those who are persuaded by his ideas see the extent to which our
      poverty and many of our other social and economic ills are related to a system
      of perverse incentives and wrong taxes which allow some to privatize that which
      is rightly the property of all of us. And on the flip side, Georgists seek
      to reduce and even eliminiate our reliance on taxes which take from the individual
      that which is rightly his: the fruits of his labor.</p>

        justification for all the cruel wrongs of human slavery? Is it not
        but yesterday when whoever dared to say that the rights of property
        did not justly attach to human beings; when whoever dared to deny
        that human beings could be rightfully bought and sold like
        cattle&#8211;the husband torn from the wife and the child from the
        mother; when whoever denied the right of whoever had paid his money
        for him to work or whip his own nigger was looked upon as a wicked
        assailant of the rights of property? Is it not but yesterday when in
        the South whoever whispered such a thought took his life in his
        hands; when in the North the abolitionist was held by the churches as
        worse than an infidel, was denounced by the politicians and
        rotten-egged by the mob? I was born in a Northern State, I have never

        American of middle age must remember, how over and over again I have
        heard all questionings of slavery silenced by the declaration that
        the negroes were the property of their masters, and that to take away
        a man's slave without payment was as much a crime as to take away his
        horse without payment. <span style="font-weight: bold;">And whoever
        does not remember that far back,
        let him look over American literature previous to the war, and say
        whether, if the business of piracy had been a flourishing business,
        it would have lacked defenders? Let him say whether any proposal to
        stop the business of piracy without compensating the pirates would
        not have been denounced at first as a proposal to set aside vested
        rights?</span> ...<a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html"> <span

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You assume that there are in the natural order two classes, the rich and
    the poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say that there are differences in capacity, in diligence,
    in health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
    however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor. The
    natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not greater than
    are natural differences in stature. But while it is only by selecting giants
    and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as others, yet in the difference
    between rich and poor that exists today we find some men richer than other
    men by the thousandfold and the millionfold.</p>
  <p>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide with differences
    in individual powers and aptitudes. The real difference between rich and
    poor is the difference between those who hold the tollgates and those who
    pay toll; between tribute-receivers and tribute-yielders. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Men who are sure of getting food when they shall need it eat only what appetite
    dictates. But with the sparse tribes who exist on the verge of the habitable
    globe life is either a famine or a feast. Enduring hunger for days, the fear
    of it prompts them to gorge like anacondas when successful in their quest
    of game. And so, what gives wealth its curse is what drives men to seek it,
    what makes it so envied and admired &#8212; the fear of want. As the unduly
    rich are the corollary of the unduly poor, so is the soul-destroying quality
    of riches but the reflex of the want that embrutes and degrades. The real
    evil lies in the injustice from which unnatural possession and unnatural
    deprivation both spring.</p>
  <p>But this injustice can hardly be charged on individuals or classes. The
    existence of private property in land is a great social wrong from which
    society at large suffers, and of which the very rich and the very poor are
    alike victims, though at the opposite extremes. Seeing this, it seems to
    us like a violation of Christian charity to speak of the rich as though they
    individually were responsible for the sufferings of the poor. Yet, while
    you do this, you insist that the cause of monstrous wealth and degrading
    poverty shall not be touched. Here is a man with a disfiguring and dangerous
    excrescence. One physician would kindly, gently, but firmly remove it. Another
    insists that it shall not be removed, but at the same time holds up the poor
    victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right?</p>
  <p>In seeking to restore all men to their equal and natural rights we do not
    seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both know by faith and
    see by fact that injustice can profit no one and that justice must benefit
    all.</p>
  <p>Nor do we seek any &#8220;futile and ridiculous equality.&#8221; We recognize,
    with you, that there must always be differences and inequalities. In so far
    as these are in conformity with the moral law, in so far as they do not violate
    the command, &#8220;Thou shalt not steal,&#8221; we are content. We do not
    seek to better God&#8217;s work; we seek only to do his will. The equality
    we would bring about is not the equality of fortune, but the equality of
    natural opportunity; the equality that reason and religion alike proclaim &#8212; the
    equality in usufruct of all his children to the bounty of Our Father who
    art in Heaven. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp; (1887
      speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>Natural religion and revealed
        religion alike tell us that God is no respecter of persons; that He did
        not make this planet for a few individuals; that He did not give it to
        one generation in preference to other generations, but that He made it
        for the use during their lives of all the people that His providence
        brings into the world. If this be true, the child that is born tonight
        in the humblest tenement in the most squalid quarter of New York, comes
        into life seized with as good a title to the land of this city as any
        Astor or Rhinelander.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How do we know that the
        Almighty is against poverty? That it is not in accordance with His
        decree that poverty exists? We know it because we know this, that the
        Almighty has declared: "Thou shalt not steal." And we know for a truth
        that the poverty that exists today in the midst of abounding wealth is
    the result of a system that legalizes theft.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
    <br>
    <small>The women who by the thousands are bending over their needles or
        sewing machines, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day; these widows
        straining and striving to bring up the little ones deprived of their
        natural breadwinner; the children that are growing up in squalor and
        wretchedness, underclothed, underfed, undereducated, even in this city,
        without any place to play &#8212; growing up under conditions in which only a
        miracle can keep them pure &#8212; under conditions which condemn them in
        advance to the penitentiary or the brothel &#8212; they suffer, they die,
        because we permit them to be robbed, robbed of their birthright, robbed
        by a system which disinherits the vast majority of the children that
    come into the world.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>There is enough and to spare for them. Had they the equal rights
        in the estate which their Creator has given them, there would be no
        young girls forced to unwomanly toil to eke out a mere existence; no
        widows finding it such a bitter, bitter struggle to put bread into the
        mouths of their little children; no such misery and squalor as we may
        see here in the greatest of American cities; misery and squalor that
        are deepest in the largest and richest centers of our civilization
    today.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">These things are the results of
        legalized theft, the fruit of a denial of that commandment that says: "Thou
        shalt not steal." </span>How is this great commandment
        interpreted today, even by men who preach the Gospel? "Thou shalt not
        steal." Well, according to some of them, it means: "Thou shalt not get
        into the penitentiary." Not much more than that with some. You may
        steal, provided you steal enough, and you do not get caught. Do not
        steal a few dollars &#8212; that may be dangerous, but if you steal millions
    and get away with it, you become one of our first citizens.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>"Thou shalt not steal"; that is the law of God. What does it
        mean? Well, it does not merely mean that you shall not pick pockets! It
        does not merely mean that you shall not commit burglary or highway
        robbery! There are other forms of stealing which it prohibits as well. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It certainly means (if it has any meaning)
        that we shall not take that to which we are not entitled, to the
    detriment of others. </span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small><b></b>Now, here is a desert. Here is a caravan going along over
        the desert. Here is a gang of robbers. They say: "Look! There is a rich
        caravan; let us go and rob it, kill the men if necessary, take their
        goods from them, their camels and horses, and walk off." But one of the
        robbers says:&nbsp; "Oh, no; that is dangerous; besides, that would be
        stealing! Let us, instead of doing that, go ahead to where there is a
        spring, the only spring at which this caravan can get water in this
        desert.&nbsp; Let us put a wall around it and call it ours, and when
        they come up we won&#8217;t let them have any water until they have given us
        all the goods they have." That would be more gentlemanly, more polite,
        and more respectable; but would it not be theft all the same? And is it
        not theft of the same kind when people go ahead in advance of
        population and get land they have no use whatever for, and then, as
        people come into the world and population increases, will not let this
  increasing population use the land until they pay an exorbitant price?<strong>... </strong></small>    </p>
  <p><small>People do not have a natural right to demand employment of
            another, but they have a natural right, an inalienable right, a right
            given by their Creator, to demand opportunity to employ themselves. And
            whenever that right is acknowledged, whenever the people who want to go
            to work can find natural opportunities to work upon, then there will be
            as much competition among employers who are anxious to get people to
            work for them, as there will be among people who are anxious to get
            work.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Wages will rise in every vocation to the true rate of wages &#8212;
    the full, honest earnings of labor. That done, with this ever
            increasing social fund to draw upon, poverty will be abolished, and in
            a little while will come to be looked upon &#8212; as we are now beginning to
    look upon slavery &#8212; as the relic of a darker and more ignorant age.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>I remember &#8212; this man here remembers (turning to Mr. Redpath,
            who was on the platform) even better than I, for he was one of the men
            who brought the atrocities of human slavery home to the heart and
            conscience of the north &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;">I well
            remember, as he well knows, and all the older men and women in this
            audience will remember, how property in human flesh and blood was
            defended just as private property in land is now defended; how the same
            charges were hurled upon the men and women who protested against human
            slavery as are now made against the men and women who are intending to
    abolish industrial slavery.</span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We remember how some
            dignitaries and rich members of the churches branded as a disturber,
            almost as a reviler of religion, any priest or any minister who dared
            to get up and assert God&#8217;s truth &#8212; that there never was and there
    never could be rightful property in human flesh and blood.</span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>So, it is now said that people who protest against this system,
            which is simply another form of slavery, are people who propose
            robbery. Thus the commandment, "Thou shalt not steal," they have made
"Thou shalt not object to stealing." When we propose to resume our own
            again, when we propose to secure its natural right to every child that
            comes into being, such people talk of us as advocating confiscation &#8212; charge
            us with being deniers of the rights of property. The real truth is that we
            wish to assert the just rights of property, that we wish to
    prevent theft.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chattel slavery was incarnate
            theft of the worst kind. </span>That system which made property of
            human beings, which allowed one person to sell another, which allowed
            one person to take away the proceeds of another&#8217;s toil, which permitted
            the tearing of the child from the mother, and which permitted the
            so-called owner to hunt with bloodhounds the person who escaped from
            the owner&#8217;s tyranny &#8212; that form of slavery is abolished. To that
            extent, the command, "Thou shalt not steal," has been vindicated; but
            there is another form of slavery. ...&nbsp;<a
