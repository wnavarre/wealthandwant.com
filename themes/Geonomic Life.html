INTRODUCTORY KIT</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><small>It's fine to know of
lofty philosophical considerations, and comforting
to know that both social justice and prosperity can be thereby
reconciled, but what of ordinary everyday practicalities?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Firstly, in a Geonomic society, the experience of real liberty
would
pervade everything. For citizens would not be beholden to the
government to supply it all sorts of financial and personal information
demanded by the tax system. Instead of having to abide by a multitude
of tax requirements, the land you occupy would simply be assessed by
professional assessors. This would only occur once a year, and the
assessors would not even need to step onto your property because it
would only be your land and not the improvements that would be assessed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Gone are the armies of tax accountants, tax lawyers and tax
department
bureaucrats. Gone are the inefficiencies of speculation, the black
economy and its attendant criminal elements. Gone is the pool of
unemployed and the cost of supporting it (much more on this later).
Gone are many of the social problems arising from unemployment,
poverty, despair arising from hopelessness, and resentment resulting
from great inequities of wealth. And because of LVT and other eco-taxes
apply to all of the Global Commons, we'll live on a much healthier
planet - and so will our children.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Instead, in steps an inconceivable prosperity resulting from a
dynamic
economy that encourages productivity, discourages speculation, is not
hampered by high welfare needs, abolishes privilege, and doesn't
undersell our natural environment. It is estimated that a typical
household will have a true disposable income (after all taxes) often
double that of the current system, and that the average business will
earn trading profits after tax/rent considerably greater (refer to the
section "What's in it for me?").</small><br>
<br>
<small>Will this lead to a Singaporean-style society hell-bent on the
accumulation of material wealth? It should be said that there will
undoubtedly be some who will strive for affluence, and if they wish to
live in big houses, drive big cars and have huge bank accounts then
good luck to 'em! Remember, in this free and fair society, anyone this
wealthy has become so by their own efforts and not by exploiting others
nor the Global Commons.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But might our whole mentality be unimaginably different in this
new
world? No longer threatened by the dead hand of joblessness and the
miserably low wages inflicted on workers "lucky enough" to have a job,
a new sense of security might well infuse all. And the energetic
productivity of Geonomics would enable all, if they wish, to work far
fewer hours to provide their basic needs. What is difficult to imagine
is the use to which this sudden availability of leisure time will be
put - the arts, travel, exercise, personal &amp; spiritual growth, or
maybe just lying around in bed eating junk food?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Things will be a lot different outside the suburbs, too. Gone is
the
opportunity to loot natural resources, and perhaps the predatory
attitude towards nature that went with it. With LVT encouraging land to
be put to its best possible use, no longer will cities sprawl over what
should be farmland. Similarly, barely-productive farmland won't sprawl
over what should remain as forest, national park or wilderness. We deal
more fully with environmental benefits in the second kit.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Businesses will truly be unchained by real tax reform. No longer
will
they have to keep endless financial records to satisfy tax
requirements, nor will they be burdened by the huge compliance costs of
frequent tax returns. You, the shopper, will see the savings passed on
- and, of course, there will be no GST.</small><br>
<br>
<small>With economic policies no longer being so contentious, politics
would
take on a different dimension. The political issues of the day would
rightly return to the great social questions dealing with education,
global and personal peace, cultural enrichment, human rights, national
goals etc.</small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT and other eco-taxes (perhaps supplemented by a few remaining
taxes
on damaging social undesirables such as on tobacco and alcohol) will,
by many calculations, be more than enough to replace current taxes.
This is only one half of the equation - the revenue side - so how
should a government spend this revenue? Geonomics doesn't deal with the
spending issues, as priorities understandably vary greatly from culture
to culture. Each society must decide for itself whether it wants to
give spending priorities to education, defence (?!), social welfare,
environmental repair, mosques, infrastructure etc. Or perhaps it might
decide not to spend everything, and instead to distribute much of it as
a Citizens' Dividend.Under the current system, public expenditure
enriches private
landowners courtesy of unwitting taxpayers. For example, if a
government invests $millions in a new railway line, the value of land
near the railway line is enormously enhanced. Because the value of this
public investment has effectively disappeared into the "Black Hole" of
private land values, prohibitive rail fares must be charged. But
imagine this: what if we collected some of the boosted land values
through Land Value Taxation (LVT) - couldn't we could lower the fares?
And if we lowered the fares, this would enhance the land values now
that the accessible train service is cheaper to use. Enhanced land
values means more LVT to collect which could lead to lower fares and so
on and so on.</small><br>
<br>
<small>While these iterations wouldn't need to be done in practice, the
above
scenario illustrates how enhanced land values (created by the
community) are recaptured or recycled back to the community. Whether we
build a bridge, a park, a bike track, a community centre or
rehabilitate creekside vegetation - all these sort of life-enhancing
investments also enhance land values, which can be fully recouped for
further projects. This is just one aspect of Geonomics and one more
piece of the unemployment puzzle, but let's now take a peek at how this
tax shift can improve our neighbourhood and lifestyle. ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<p>Karl Williams: <a href="../docs/unindexed/Williams_Two-Cow_Economics.htm">Two
    Cow Economics</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NEOCLASSICAL LAND-MONOPOLY CAPITALIST</span><br>
    You have two cows and several hectares of land.</p>
  <p>Your neighbour is a single mother, has no cows, no land and works a part-time
    job.</p>
  <p>You tell her that if she works longer and harder she could buy one of your
    cows and become an enterprising capitalist. So she takes on full-time work
    so that, after 3 months, she has saved enough money to buy one of your cows.</p>
  <p>But what use is a cow (or anything, for that matter) without a plot of your
    land, which is now worth $20,000?</p>
  <p>So your neighbour takes on a night shift in addition to her day job, leaving
    for work after the kids are in bed and arriving home just in time to get
    them dressed for school.</p>
  <p>After a year she has saved enough money to buy that land.</p>
  <p>Expressing great regret you explain that, in the meantime, the taxes on
    her income have paid for the infrastructure that have boosted the value of
    your land, so that the current market price for that plot is now worth $30,000.
    Back to the grindstone, baby!</p>
  <p> Another year of sweat and toil follows, after which she returns with the
    money. But, with hand on heart, you break the news that economic circumstances
    have recently driven most single and married mothers to bring in an extra
    income in order to save for the ever-escalating price of land. As no-one&#8217;s
    making any more land, the greater number of bidders has pushed up the price
    of the fixed amount of land (this is called a &#8220;healthy, buoyant property
    market&#8221;). It&#8217;s now worth $40,000 but it would be a lot easier
    if she just got a bank loan, you tell her. However, all those eager bidders
    for land have also bid up the rate of interest they&#8217;re prepared to
    suffer, so that interest rates are now prohibitive. Your neighbour collapses
    in tears at your feet, but what can you do? &#8211; you didn&#8217;t invent
    the system! Just as our poor mum relents and considers taking out a mortgage,
    she finally gets some good news &#8211; in a surprise move, the Reserve Bank
    has decided to make it easier on prospective home-owners by reducing interest
    rates. However, this has had the effect of making the owning of property
    more attractive, so &#8211; immediately the interest rate decision is announced &#8211; landowners
    raise the selling price of land. The &#8220;fair market price&#8221; of that
    plot is now $50,000.<br>
          <br>
    However, under political pressure because of the unaffordability of property,
    the federal government announce that it will institute a First Home Owners&#8217; grant
    of $7,000. Suddenly that plot is selling for $57,000.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">GEOIST</span><br>
    You have two cows and several acres of land.</p>
  <p> Your neighbour is a single mother, has no cows, no land and works a minimum
    wage job.</p>
  <p> You&#8217;ve had an amazing vision wherein you see the geoist paradigm
    in all its glory and realise that all other reforms are just band-aids, so
    you become an activist with ProsperAustralia. You share your insight with
    your neighbour and so everyone pulls together to successfully reform our
    insane tax laws and system of land tenure. As a result:<br>
    (1) your neighbour can keep all of her hard-earned income, and<br>
    (2) those who have enclosed substantial amounts of the Common Wealth for
    their own private domain now pay fair land value taxation (LVT) to society.<br>
        <br>
    Your LVT bill arrives and you realise you have been holding more land than
    you really need, so auction off the title to your land and the improvements
    on it. Because of genuine tax relief, your neighbour can now afford to buy
    the property.<br>
        <br>
    And so - with LVT and trust and angel dust - they all live happily ever after.&nbsp; ... <a href="../docs/unindexed/Williams_Two-Cow_Economics.htm">read
