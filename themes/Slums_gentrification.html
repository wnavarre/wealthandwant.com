  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><small>"Slum
    clearance" in the 1950s had a negative caste, with a name
    catered solely for middle class consumption. Reuse of cleared land
    was often at lower density, inevitably throwing unhoused people on
    the private market. Federal "urban re-newal" in the 1960s, while
    better named, emphasized clearing, not rebuilding. The inventory of
    cleared, unrebuilt land under the program grew each year. Cynics'
    cracks of "bombing out" and "Negro re-moval" were on the mark, though
    blacks were not the only evictees. Any talk of demolition and renewal
    evokes the specters of those cruel, wasteful programs. </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But George's program begins with
    fostering renewal and intensive
    use. Clearance is involved only to serve renewal, never as a goal in
    itself. The first land taken would generally be vacant or with
    boarded-up buildings. New buildings would draw renters and buyers
    from old ones, releasing more space. The idea and impact are to
    increase rentable, salable floor space. There would also be more
    firms to compete in selling and hiring. How do we know there would be
    an aggregate increase in supply? 
    </small></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>Higher density is one test. Untaxing
    buildings fosters higher density because density, exemplified by high
    buildings, substitutes capital for land. Untaxing capital obviously
    makes it more economical.</small></li>
      <li><small>Higher quality is the other test. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The richer the new tenants or
    buyers, the more space is released when they move. This is the
    hardest point for advocates of the poor to accept. There will always
    be specific cases where the rich bump the poor, leading to
    contemptuous names like "trickle-down" that dismiss effects on the
    market. But the aggregate is what should concern us.</span> If tenants
    mobilize against new construction, a minority with a vested interest
    harms everyone else, including the poor. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Building new
    homes for the
    rich, who can afford them, releases usable space for everyone
    else.</span></small></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There
    are three kinds of slums.</span></small></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small>Only the narrowest kind, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
    slum
    on high-value land</span>, causes eviction of the poor to benefit the
    rich.
    Owners in these uncommon areas neglect their buildings, expecting to
    demolish them for expanding commerce or high-rise apartments. 
      </small></li>
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
    second kind is on bad land which will stay bad</span>. 
      </small></li>
      <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The third, and most
    common, kind is on good land with old buildings that have filtered
    down to people who generate bad neighborhood effects</span>. Units go
    vacant; land value is low. The market renews these slums not in a
    stroke, but by nibbling at the fringes. Yet as it nibbles
    incrementally in, it unavoidably creates more space than it consumes,
    raising aggregate supply.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The poor also must fear <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">gentrification</span>, in which new gentry
    displace the poor in the same old buildings. This is one result of
    not renewing; renewal as such is innocent. It seems carping, too, to
    criticize people for restoring old buildings. The alternative may be
    seen in ungentrified neighborhoods, where buildings simply go out of
    use, sheltering no one. But the ultimate end of Georgist policy is
    viewed in terms of the nation, pitting cities against each other to
    attract people.

    Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PTiaPT.html">The Property Tax
    is a Progressive Tax</a><br>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Definition of the property tax
    base is also a source of serious
    error in a number of studies based on cash rents. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Netzer for example
    assumes that property taxes are proportional to rents. They aren't. The
    base is not rent but capital value. The poor live in declining
    neighborhoods and buildings nearing abandonment, where capital value
    is a very low multiple of rent.</span> Rents include high costs for
    collection, turnover, damage, loss of status, maintenance and
    repairs, and general unpleasantness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In
    Milwaukee's "Inner Core" or
    slum area the rule of thumb is you pay 30 months' rent to buy a
    dwelling unit. </span>Tenant incomes are low, but higher than such
    capital
    values. The rich live in new buildings of long future life in
    appreciating neighborhoods. Incomes are high, but normally less than
    half of lot or acreage plus house values.</small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is true that slums are often
    overassessed, but again,
    maladministration is the fault of administrators. The property tax
    in concept is progressive precisely because it is based on capital
    value. Owners of appreciating property often complain that capital
    value as a base hits them harder than would current income or service
    flow as a base, and they are right. That is precisely what makes the
    property tax, correctly administered, so progressive. <a

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
    and Efficiency</small><br>

    <small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
    <small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
    a case
    for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
    logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
    follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
    principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
    the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
    one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
    is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
    important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
    efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
    because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
    for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
    on land
    would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
    report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
    shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
    in the Appendix.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
    taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
    reasons
    why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
    world peace.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
    argument for
    taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
    offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
    rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
    price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
    land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
    increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
    become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
    land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
    on
    land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
    the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
    erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
    because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
    collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
    <small>.</small><br>
    <small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
    that the
    return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
    rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
    what land
    is. ...</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>A similar phenomenon occurs with respect to the personal value
    that
    people attach to locations, what might be called &#8216;location-specific
    human capital&#8217;.&nbsp; If all persons had equal demands for all
    locations, there would be no location-specific human capital.&nbsp; But
    incomes, tastes and personal histories differ, leading to differing
    personal values for locations.&nbsp; Famil&shy;iarity with a location
    tends to lead people to attach a special value to it, a value that
    tends to be lost if the characteristics of the location change.&nbsp;
    Thus a change in land use that raises surrounding land values will
    generally reduce the location-specific human capital of the residents
    of that area.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One
    example of this phenomenon occurs when a
    neighborhood is &#8216;gentrified&#8217;, and the prior residents of modest means
    can no longer afford to live there and must seek other housing options
    that are less attractive to them than the opportunities they
    lost.&nbsp; This represents a reduction in their location-specific
    human capital.</span> ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

    </span>Walter Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Metropolis.html">The
    Uncertain Future of the Metropolis</a><br>
    <br style="font-weight: bold;">
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The single element that makes me
    apprehensive about the future of our cities is our land system.
    Tentacles
    of our misguided land policies are choking almost every vital aspect of
    metropolitan life. This is doubly worrisome, because the full
    dimensions of the land problem have barely surfaced in the public
    consciousness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To put it in the
    vernacular, most of us don't know what's eating us. </span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>We have scarcely begun to identify the causes of today's city
    land
    problems. This is not to denigrate the legions of good folk --
    officials and citizens alike -- who are trying desperately to cope with
    the daily disasters. But without a better notion of what is producing
    these disasters, we are unlikely to stem the flood.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A major problem, certainly, is
    our
    distorted land system that operates around the clock and around the
    calendar, and under the full sanction of the law. It rips off the poor,
    saps small business, and deprives municipalities of their rightful
    revenue.</span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The people as a whole create
    land
    values, not only by their presence, but also through participation in
    government, as taxpayers.</span> Schools, firehouses, streets, police,
    water lines -- the whole gamut of public works and services that
    enhance a neighborhood are converted into higher land values. The
    taxpayers of the entire country, through federal aid for our
    multi-billion-dollar Metrorail project, have been boosting Washington,
    D.C. land values mightily.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not all land values are
    manmade. Inherent qualities also give land special advantages:</span>
    fertile soils in farming districts, scenic views in residential areas,
    subsurface riches of coal, oil, and minerals. None of us, as landlords,
    tenants, or governments, can lay claim to having created these values.
    The people who have been drawing up an international law of the Seas
    have <span style="font-weight: bold;">characterized these natural
    endowments as "the common heritage of mankind", where no people,
    individually or collectively, produce these land values,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is difficult to argue with the
    conclusion that they belong to all people equally.</span></span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>If the institution of private property
    has a sound foundation, and I believe it does, then it rests on the
    principle that people have a right to reap what they sow, to retain for
    themselves what they themselves produce or earn. Land values, produced
    by all of society, and by nature, do not conform to this prescription.
    ...</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Decade after decade, billions of
    dollars in urban land values are being siphoned off by a narrowing
    class that has no ethical or economic claim to them. To be outraged
    when a few ghetto dwellers, in an occasional frenzy of despair, engage
    in looting on a relatively miniscule scale, but to remain indifferent
    to this massive, wholesale looting, is worse than hypocritical. It is
    to ignore a catastrophic social maladjustment, more severe, I believe,
    than anything the U.S. has experienced since slavery. ...</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>But I sense that we are drifting rapidly towards a
    landlord-dominated society. ... </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Before that happens, the opportunity
    awaits to see whether a reasonably free economy can still be made to
    work. Unless we tackle the land question, and the looting of America,
    that game may be forfeited. </small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The future of the
    metropolis is uncertain. The choice is ours. We can
    intervene in the way society is now headed, to preserve the American
    dream. Or, we can continue along the present path and await the
    American nightmare.&nbsp;</small>

    Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
    Capacity of Land</a><br>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;The question I am
    assigned is whether the taxable
    capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
    cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
    is "yes."</b></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
    local revenue problem today is
    whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
    exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
    California. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He keeps repeating we
    must make a hard choice: cut taxes
    and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
    figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
    one of them.)</span></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
    a property tax based on
    land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
    driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
    certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
    rate,
    not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
    town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
    that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
    think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</b></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There is the answer to
    Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope here
    in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
    answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
    now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
    object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
    toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Non-property
    taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
    activity.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>New
    buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
    it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
    fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
    of their lower property tax rate. ...
    </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>When you observe cities
    much, the positive neighborhood
    effects of replacing old buildings with new are irresistible and
    contagious, raising land prices all around. The converse is also
    true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
    without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
    new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
    off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope
    into optimism: optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax
    base.</b></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There are three kinds of
    slums.</small></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><small><b>Type I slums</b> develop on land in the van of downtown
    expansion, on land held for a future higher use. The speculators are
    milking the old structures for any residual value. They don't much mind
    when the tenants leave, and spare them the trouble of an eviction when
    they want to sell or rebuild. That's what they're in it for: the
    current use is incidental.</small></li>
      <li><small><b>Type III slums</b> (listed here out of numerical order)
    develop on land that is no good, and may never be, like floodplains and
    earthquake faults. They also develop around abbatoirs, dumps,
    stockyards, etc., although these are subject to change. In either case,
    people are driven there by the inadequate development of good land.</small></li>
      <li><small><b>Type II slums</b>, our focus here, are the most
    extensive. They occur on good or superior residential land originally
    developed over fifty or a hundred years ago. It may once have housed
    the upper crust, but as the buildings aged without replacement they
"filtered down," and down, and down, until their occupants began
    radiating negative neighborhood effects. There comes a tipping point
    where the neighborhood self- destructs cumulatively, because no one
    wants to build new in a decayed, menacing neighborhood. The renewal
    value of land is lost, the tax base is lost, nothing remains but social
    and public costs: a municipal disaster area. The city that fails to
    renew itself on time is steering itself to this fate, like Camden, the
    Bronx, East St. Louis, Benton Harbor, MI, and Detroit.</small></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;That's the bad news. How do
    you turn it around? When you
    drop buildings from the property tax base, you change the arithmetic
    of incentives, as we have discussed. Parachuting into the middle of a
    slum is still hopeless, as before. Change will come first to the
    fringes of the Type II slum, where it merges into healthy
    neighborhoods. New development likes to anchor onto healthy
    neighborhoods. Richard Hurd, father of urban studies in America,
    taught us in 1902 that land values are marked by continuity in space.
    It's still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles last.
    <b>Hope survives at the edge of the slum; land there retains some
    renewal value. There is where you'll first see change, because there
    is where the forces are evenly balanced. Tip the forces for renewal,
    and there is where it begins.</b></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Once it begins, it
    proceeds incrementally through the
    Type II slum. When it's through, your oldest neighborhood has become
    your newest, the cutting edge of progress, the showplace of the town.
    That is how it has got to work; that is how it will work when you
    exempt buildings and tax only land. When it is through, you have a
    high tax base where now you have nothing but fire and police
    calls.</b></small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;I once wrote a long chapter
    on this subject, "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">T</span><b><i>he
    Adequacy of Land as a Tax Base</i></b>" (Gaffney, 1970). It came out
    of two years of research, and is too long even to summarize now. I am
    delivering it to Pat Salkin, however, and hope she may add it to the
    record of this conference. I also attach a short bibliography of
    articles that expand on topics covered above, for whoever is moved to
    study more on this fascinating subject. I hope you think it as
    important as I do. <b>Please pick up this ball and run with it.
    Nobody said it was going to be easy. There are some bone-crushing
    line-backers out there, like Greed, Ignorance, Myopia, and Inertia.
    So much the more credit to you when you cross the line: your fans
    will love you for a touchdown. They really need a lift; they've
    waited so long!&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><a style="font-weight: bold;"
