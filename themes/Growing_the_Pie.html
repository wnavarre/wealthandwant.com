  <p>Money used to buy land from another person or corporation does not create
      demand for a product of which more can be produced. From the point of view
      of the economy, you might as well bury that money. </p>
  <p>The alternative? Lower
      the price of land and make it affordable to those who will put it to use.      </p>
  <p>How do we lower it? If we wanted to benefit the FIRE sector (Finance, Insurance,
        Real Estate), we could do that by increasing the interest rate &#8212; but
        the individual and the corporation would still have taxes to pay. The right
        way is to increase the tax on land value, collecting for the commons that
        which now sits in landholders' pockets even though it is not of their making:
        the annual economic value of the land they occupy.</p>
  <p>Georgists don't see economic life as a zero-sum gain. We see huge opportunities
    to grow the economic pie through logical and just incentives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> This is the secret which would transform the little village into the great
          city.*</li>
    <li><strong>With all the burdens removed which now oppress industry and hamper exchange,
          the production of wealth would go on with a rapidity now undreamed of.</strong></li>
    <li><strong> This, in its turn, would lead to an increase in the value of land &#8212; a
          new surplus which society might take for general purposes.</strong></li>
    <li> And released from the difficulties which attend the collection of revenue
          in a way that begets corruption and renders legislation the tool of special
          interests, society could assume functions which the increasing complexity
          of life makes it desirable to assume, but which the prospect of political
          demoralization under the present system now leads thoughtful men to shrink
          from.
        <p><font size="-1">*At the beginning of <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Book
                IX </a>of the complete Progress &amp; Poverty, Henry George quotes from
                Themistocles: &quot;I cannot play upon any stringed instrument, but I
                can tell you how of a little village to make a great and glorious city.&quot;</font></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
  <p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
      of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
      an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
      would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would be
      felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates upon
      exchange like artificial deserts and mountains;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to carry
          them around the world.</li>
    <li> It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a
      fine upon those qualities.</li>
    <li> If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
      been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually to
      make
          me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than
      you.</li>
    <li> If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
    <li> If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he
      had done an injury to the state;</li>
    <li> if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though
          it were a public nuisance;</li>
    <li> if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which would
          go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
    <li> We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it among
          us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.</li>
    <li> We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
      grain,</li>
    <li> we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have attempted
      to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have
      before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
      prices.</p>
  <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of taxation
      from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory;
      the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship;
    the farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would
    be
      free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed
    by the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The
      more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the state
      would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising
      as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall not be fined
      for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before; you shall not
      be taxed
      for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
  <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
      the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
      the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
      reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural reward.
      The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep
      to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
      enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
      advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
      the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain
      to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
      supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
      it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
      rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
      else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
      besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
  <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts him
      to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
      and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
      and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
      And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
      and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
      labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
      this would commensurately increase.</p>
  <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
      or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
      of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
      one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
      would everywhere be thrown open to improvement. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    12. Effect of Remedy Upon Various Economic Classes</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Part
    IX: Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 3. Of the effect upon individuals
    and classes</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
      are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to
    the fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this
    is a proposition
      to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will
    show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as
    landholders
      do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
      And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may
    lose relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For,
    the
      increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain
    very much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these
    gains,
      and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the
    whole community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
          all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head -- laborers,
      operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional men of all sorts.</li>
    <li> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
      by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital -- storekeepers, merchants,
          manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of
      all sorts
          from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner -- and</li>
    <li> it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose
          incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital. ... </li>
  </ul>
  <p>... In short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist, as well
          as a landowner, and it is by his labor and capital that his living is made.
          His
        loss would be nominal; his gain would be real and great. In varying degrees
        is this true of all landholders. Many landholders are laborers of one sort
        or another. This measure would make no one poorer but such as could be made
        a great deal poorer without being really hurt. It would cut down great fortunes,
        but it would impoverish no one.</p>
  <p>Wealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally distributed.
      I do not mean that each individual would get the same amount of wealth. That
      would not be equal distribution, so long as different individuals have different
      powers and different desires. But I mean that wealth would be distributed in
      accordance with the degree in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence
      of each contributed to the common stock. The great cause which concentrates
      wealth in the hands of those who do not produce, and takes it from the hands
      of those who do, would be gone. The inequalities that continued to exist would
      be those of nature, not the artificial inequalities produced by the denial
      of natural law. The nonproducer would no longer roll in luxury while the producer
      got but the barest necessities of animal existence. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read

Martin Luther King, Jr: <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">Where
        Do We Go From Here?</a> (1967)</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <p><strong>I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be
        the most effective &#8212; the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly
        by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.</strong></p>
    <p>Earlier in this century this proposal would have been greeted with ridicule
      and denunciation as destructive of initiative and responsibility. At that
      time economic status was considered the measure of the individual's abilities
      and talents. In the simplistic thinking of that day the absence of worldly
      goods indicated a want of industrious habits and moral fiber.</p>
    <p>We have come a long way in our understanding of human motivation and of
      the blind operation of our economic system. Now we realize that dislocations
      in the market operation of our economy and the prevalence of discrimination
      thrust people into idleness and bind them in constant or frequent unemployment
      against their will. The poor are less often dismissed from our conscience
      today by being branded as inferior and incompetent. We also know that no
      matter how dynamically the economy develops and expands it does not eliminate
      all poverty.</p>
    <p>We have come to the point where we must make the nonproducer a consumer
      or we will find ourselves drowning in a sea of consumer goods. We have
      so energetically mastered production that we now must give attention to
      distribution. Though there have been increases in purchasing power, they
      have lagged behind increases in production. Those at the lowest economic
      level, the poor white and Negro, the aged and chronically ill, are traditionally
      unorganized and therefore have little ability to force the necessary growth
      in their income. They stagnate or become even poorer in relation to the
      larger society.</p>
    <p>The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create
      full employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers
      by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position, we need
      to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New
      forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for
      those for whom traditional jobs are not available.</p>
    <p>In 1879 Henry George anticipated this state of affairs when he wrote,
      in <em>Progress and Poverty</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> &quot;The fact is that the work which improves the condition of mankind,
        the work which extends knowledge and increases power and enriches literature,
        and elevates thought, is not done to secure a living. It is not the work
        of slaves, driven to their task either by the lash of a master or by
        animal necessities. It is the work of men who perform it for their own
        sake, and not that they may get more to eat or drink, or wear, or display.
        In a state of society where want is abolished, work of this sort could
        be enormously increased.&quot; [from Book IX: Effects of the Remedy;

        and social life] ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">read the book
