<p align="center"><strong>Themes</strong></p>
<p>A number of themes recur in Georgist writings, and I assembled this index
  for my own edification, because as I encountered concepts that were unfamiliar
  to me, I found it useful to be able to find other references to them easily.
  Viewed side by side, the references helped me understand what I was reading.</p>
<p>At the top of the individual page for each theme, you'll find a list of related
  concepts, which might be of interest to you once you've read through the rest
  of the page.</p>
<p>Below that, there might be a quote which illustrates the importance of the
  theme.</p>
<p>Next is a list of the documents on this website which contain references to
  the theme. Each is linked to a section further down on the page which contains
  extended excerpts on the topic. You can go directly to the document from the
  list, or from the beginning or end of the extended excerpt.</p>
<p>You may find the themes useful in finding your way around the website initially,
  in re-finding a document you found relevant, and in figuring out how to share
the website with people based on their interests and values.</p>
