    <p>          Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
      Capacity of Land</a> </p>
  </div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The question I am
assigned is whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He keeps repeating we
must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There is the answer to
Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope here
in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Non-property
taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>New
buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
of their lower property tax rate. <strong>...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We also hear, sometimes,
that "it's never been done," or
it's only been done by our drab neighbor Pennsylvania, for whom
familiarity may have bred contempt? Only "far kine have long horns."
Or, whatever progress ensued there was happening anyway. We are
destiny's tots in the grip of cosmic forces. We rise and fall with
the tide. We cannot control Fate; relax and accept what the gods dish
out. Fatalism: it's a sure recipe for milling around ineffectually
while life passes us by.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Let's raise our sights far
afield to where "it" has also
been done. I was in <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Johannesburg</b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>not
long ago, a city that thrives in the face of daunting handicaps. I am
struck by the miracle of the place; it is Bootstrap City. It should
have died when its gold mines played out, like a normal mining
boomtown. Instead it remains as the economic capital of its nation
and half a continent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Johannesburg defies and
belies many "laws" of urban
economics, such as that "mines create no great cities." Its
once-fabled gold mines are just tailings now, so it should be a ghost
town. It has no harbor, no water transportation, not even any gravity
water supply. It is, in fact, on a ridge-top (the Rand or "reef"), at
an elevation over 5,000'. Water supply is pumped uphill. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It has no sunburst of rail lines,
like Chicago or Boston, "The
Hub," except perhaps what it has attracted itself. It is on the main
rail line, but so are a thousand miles of other sites. The natural
site lacks outstanding amenities, and can't hold a candle to Cape
Town. Jo-burg has no governmental economic base. Surrounding farmland
is poor, the climate droughty. Why Johannesburg? Why is it the
largest city, the center of finance, industry, commerce, and
international air travel? &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As a public finance economist I
may overvalue incentive taxation,
but Jo-burg has it. <b>The property tax is on site value alone, and
at a high rate: they tell me it is 4%. </b>This is what makes Jo-burg
distinctive. Challenge and response: Jo-burg had to do something
right in order to survive, and that is what it did. It not only
survived, it became and remains Number One. Give me a better
explanation and I'll back off. I haven't heard one yet. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Jo-burg is not heaven, far from
it. It is surrounded by and
transfused with social problems we can hardly imagine, much more
expensive to handle and solve than what we know. That is part of the
present point. Jo-burg obstinately prospers in the face of these,
added to its natural geographic disadvantages. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cape Town, by contrast, is
Sleeping Beauty. Nature has been
generous there. It is gifted with one of the world's great harbors
and sites, ideal climate and scenery. It has the national legislative
Capitol. It enjoys the business potential of New York, the climate of
La Jolla, the scenery of Vancouver, and the political base of
Washington (or at least Albany). Tourists flock there, and would do
so even if the place were misgoverned by Mayor Idi Amin with Police
Chief Saddam Hussein. Meantime Jo-burg, the ugly duckling, walks off
with most of the nation's business. What is Cape Town's problem? It
taxes buildings, the way we do.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>Cape Town, South Africa, quit the regular
property tax in favor of a
land levy. Altho' sited on one of the world's major shipping lanes,
Cape Town's development had always lagged behind the inland
Johannesburg, an abandoned mining town that prospered in part from
levying only locations and not any improvements. Not knowing what to
expect in the aftermath of apartheid, Cape Town's civic leaders wanted
to ease the transition to a sound, integrated economy. ... <br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>How long would it take for the PTS
to take effect? A clue comes from
Johannesburg, South Africa. That city taxes land, not buildings, and
has the fastest site recycling rate in the world, a little over 20
years. That means, within a few decades of shifting the property tax,
cities could be rebuilt by market-based incentives to human-scale,
becoming relatively car-free. At last civilization could realize its
promise to humanity.<br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution
which in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The German colony of Kiaochow, China, established in 1898, had a single tax
      on land value set at 6 percent.35 Its principal city, Tsing-tao, developed
      into a fine modern city. The Germans lost the colony in 1914 at the outbreak
      of World War I, but their experience influenced the Chinese revolutionary Sun
      Yat-sen, who became head of the government of China. He and his successors
      in the Nationalist Party were not able to implement land value taxation in
      that country, but when they moved to Taiwan in 1950 after the communists took
      the mainland, Chiang-kai shek implemented a land-to-the-tiller reform accompanied
      by a tax on land value. Taiwan has since developed into a major industrial
      power. Hong Kong and Singapore became major commercial centers in large part
      because much of their public finance is based on taxing land values, or in
      the case of Hong Kong, from selling land leases, with low taxes on trade and
      commerce. </p>
  <p>Of course there are many reasons for the success of economies such as Hong
      Kong&#8217;s, but the evidence is that more economic freedom is widely
      associated with greater growth and per-capita income, in accord with the
      economic theory
      that the deadweight loss caused by restricting and taxing production leads
      to lower production.</p>
  <p>Many cities worldwide, including Johannesburg, South Africa and Sydney, Australia,
      have levied real estate taxes on land values only. Some cities in Pennsylvania
      have had a two-rate system, where land values are taxed at a rate higher than
      the tax on improvements.36 ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...&nbsp; How long would it take
to ecologize cities after shifting its
property tax? While Johannesburg (South African) levied a rate of
only 3 percent on site value, it enjoyed the fastest site-recycling
rate in the world, a little over 20 years. Within a couple decades,
we could have those cities we'd love.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As cities grow more livable and
lovable, their site values rise.
The resultant increase in land dues would push owners to continually
convert to highest and best use automatically. In this positive
feedback loop, cities would constantly renew.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While generals and anarchists
might not easily find common cause,
planners and markets can, when planners paddle with, not against, the
mighty current of rent. Correcting the market, so that taxes and
rents no longer interfere with the choices of owners and developers,
would attain highest and best use of sites automatically.&nbsp; <a
