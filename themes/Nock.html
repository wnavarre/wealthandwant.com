<p>Albert Jay Nock &#8212; <a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">Henry George: Unorthodox
    American</a> - Will Lissner's bio of Nock, appended to Nock's article on
    George</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Back in the dark days of 1932, when a despairing world and its culture were
      being torn asunder by a major catastrophe, the worst economic depression
    ever known, a man who is foremost among America's few living exponents of
    belles-lettres
      wrote in his diary under the date of Oct. 27; &quot;Now that Roosevelt
      has dug up W. G. Sumner and the Yale Press shows signs of life, enough
      to republish
      his writings; I should think someone might soon be rediscovering Henry
      George. If so, he will find that George was one of the first half-dozen
      minds of the
      nineteenth century, in all the world.&quot;</p>
  <p>The man who set that down in his characteristically small, fine hand, an
    essayist and historian who is one of the chief catalyzers of the intellectual
    ferments
      of our time, was noting no passing fancy. The idea returned to him and
    on Oct. 31 he recorded: &quot;I have been looking over the biography of Henry
    George, by his son Harry, a pains-taking sort of book. The best one can say
    for it
      is that it is competent. There should be a better one, for George was undeniably
      a great man.&quot;</p>
  <p>Not only was Albert Jay Nock, the chronicler just quoted, thinking of these
      things. In New York the editors of <em>Scribner's Magazine</em> had the
      same notion and they commissioned Mr. Nock to do the job. The essayist
      went abroad
      the following February and through the Spring lived in his beloved low
      countries, breaking his stay at last for a junket through France and Spain
      into Portugal.
      With his papers full of commissions, some of which he would not do, some
      he might do and a few he would do if time, and the business of living fully,
      permitted,
      the assignment from Scribner's caused him no preoccupation. But the personality
      of George kept popping up: at Port Cros, watching a schooner put off ten
      tons of coal on March 31, he mused: &quot;All by hand labor, with the help
      of one donkey. I wonder whether most of our labor-saving devices have really
      saved
      anything worth saving ... Henry George attacked this problem, in '<em>Progress
      and Povert</em>y', and solved it, but his solution, being valid, will not
      be accepted in a hurry.&quot;</p>
  <p>Through his friends he was keeping in close touch with hectic America. Henry
      L. Mencken wrote him, after the fiasco of the World Economic Conference: &quot;'The
      republic proceeds towards hell at a rapidly accelerating tempo.&quot; Nock
      was not profoundly stirred; he spent the next day at the Lisbon Museum. But
      the idea of re-creating Henry George was still rankling him. On June 9 he wrote
      in the diary: &quot;Overnight at Porto, on the way to Vidago, where I hope
      to find a pleasant place to stop awhile and write 'an overdue paper for
      Scribner's on Henry George.&quot;</p>
  <p>Soon he was in Vidago where &quot;one sees miserable dwellings, occupied by
      people absolutely lost in poverty and filth, built of magnificent huge granite
      blocks after the Roman fashion&quot;; in Vidago among a Portuguese people whom
      he found, nevertheless &quot;without a single exception, the kindest people
      I have ever seen.&quot; On June 15 he noted. &quot;Working steadily at quite
      high pressure on my article for Scribner's on Henry George, so the days pass
      very quickly. I hope it will call attention to him, though I suppose nothing
      will do so effectively as long as Americans are what they are&quot; or until
      tremendous hardship puts an end to their being drugged and doped by nostrums
      dealt out to them by demagogues and scoundrels.&quot; In his idyllic refuge
      --&quot;what a superb climate and what grand scenery&quot; he remarked of Vidago
      -- America became remote to him; &quot;one can hardly convince oneself while
      here, that it exists.&quot; But George, along of all his environment, persisted
      and on June 26, Mr. Nock recorded: &quot;I am done with Henry George, and shall
      leave here tomorrow. What a great man he was, and how well he managed to get
      himself misjudged and forgotten! I suppose, Scribner's, people will pull a
      long face over getting a really serious piece of work -- I often think of that
      dreadful person, Bok, writing to Lyman Abbott for 'a short, snappy life of
      Christ.'&quot; The aftermath was typical of the man; on July 29 he noted: &quot;ScrIbner's
      people seem satisfied with my piece on Henry George, and say it will come
      out in November, so I suppose all the single-taxers in the country will
      curse me
      afresh.&quot;</p>
  <p>That is how &quot;Henry George, Unorthodox American&quot; came to be written,
      as anyone can see for himself in Mr. Nock's &quot;A Journal of These Days:
      June 1932-December 1933&quot; (Morrow, 1934.) But to understand how this tabloid
      biography came to be the unique study it is, even when one compares it with
      the admirable similar studies by Broadus Mitchell and Rexford G. Tugwell, one
      must recall Mr. Nock's career. He took his bachelor's degreeat St. Stephen's
      College, where he steeped hirnse1f in the classical languages and their literatures.
      With Francis Neilson he wrote &quot;How Diplomats Make War&quot; (1915; 2d
      Ed., 1916). From 1920 to 1924, he edited the old Freeman in company with Neilson,
      Suzanne Lafollette and others equal1y notable, setting unexcelled standards
      in periodical journalism. During that period he wrote &quot;The Myth of a Guilty
      Nation&quot; under the pseudonym of Historicus (1922) and edited &quot;The
      Selected Works of Charles F. Browne (Artemus Ward)&quot; (1924), in the
      latter work establishing the native humorist as the social satirist he
      was.</p>
  <p>A scholar's life-time job found fruit in his &quot;Jefferson&quot; (1926 ).
      He followed this with a collection, &quot;On Doing the Right Thing and Other
      Essays&quot; (1928). Then, with Catherine Rose Wilson, he wrote &quot;Francis
      Rabelais, the Man and His Work&quot; (1929), first fruit of another lifetime
      interest. With Miss Wilson, he edited the Urquhart-Le Matteaux translation
      of the works of &quot;Francis Rabelais&quot; (2 vols., 1931), concluding a
      monumental work of scholarship with his book, &quot;A Journey Into Rabelais's
      France&quot; (1934). Meanwhile he had served as visiting professor of American
      history and government at Saint Stephen's and had published, under the pseudonym
      of Journeyman, &quot;The Book of Journeyman&quot; (1932) together with a noteworthy
      structure on an institution close to him, &quot;The Theory of Education&quot; (1932).</p>
  <p>The contradiction between state and society, in which Ludwig Gumplowicz
    and Franz Oppenheimer had interested him long before, resulted in a work
    as significant
      in a social sense as &quot;Rabelais&quot; and &quot;Jefferson&quot; had been
      in literary and historical senses, &quot;Our Enemy the State&quot; (1935).
      He followed this with &quot;Free Speech and Plain Language&quot; (1937).
      Throughout all these dates a stream of essays on contemporary themes poured
      from his pen,
      to find critical and keenly appreciative hearings among the readers of
      The New Republic, The Atlantic Monthly, The American Mercury and similar
      literary
      papers.</p>
  <p>What we have, then, in &quot;Henry George, Unorthodox American,&quot; is
    a living portrait of one unusual citizen of the world by another.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several prominent libertarians have recognized land value or rent as the
    source of public finance most compatible with liberty. Albert Jay Nock, for
    example,
      distinguished between the improper political means of obtaining wealth,
    such as from arbitrary taxation, and the proper economic means, from enterprise.
      He regarded public revenue from land rent as within the economic means,
    since
      the &#8220;monopoly of economic rent, on the other hand, gives exclusive rights
      to values accruing from the desire of other persons to possess that property;
      values which take their rise irrespective of any exercise of the economic means
      on the part of the holder.&#8221;25 (He used the term &#8220;monopoly&#8221; in
      its classical meaning, in which a new entrant cannot increase the supply,
      hence together, the landowners have a monopoly.) ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>
