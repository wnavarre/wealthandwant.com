<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Charging
    Tenants for Their Improvements</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>When the average community member is stuck paying both rent and taxes, and
    the effect of the tax spending is to raise the rent the landlord can collect,
    the
    system is unjustly tilted in favor of the landlords. </p>
  <p>We might perceive that
    if we are landholders &#8212; even if all we've got is a small amount of
    home equity &#8212; then the system is tilted in <em>our</em> favor, but
    if one looks carefully, it will be clear that few of us are &quot;net beneficiaries&quot; of
    the existing system. </p>
  <p>The big winners are those who own our best land, who get rich in their sleep
    &#8212; and the losers are the vast majority of the rest of us, because
    our land is less well located and because we work for a living and we pay
    taxes
    on our income and on our purchases and on our houses, taxes whose net effect
    is to
      make land more valuable.</p>

to the Land</a> (1881)&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landlordism Confiscates the
    Work of Improvers.</b>
  </small><br>
  <small>But the present system of Land Tenure not merely enables a class
    to exact from the people of the country a famine price for the use of
    the land which God made: it also enables them to charge a rent for
    the use of the improvements on the land which the people themselves
    made, which are purely the result of their own industry and capital,
    and which, in fact, on the strictest principles of justice are their
    own private property. With the knowledge and experience which we have
    acquired all our lives long of the transactions that are daily taking
    place between landlords and tenants, the clearest and most convincing
    proof that can be given of this fact will perhaps be found in the
plain and simple statement of it.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The land of Ireland would at this
moment still be in its original
state of nature had it not been drained, cleared, reclaimed and
fertilised by the enormous outlay of labour and capital which has
been expended on it by the people of the present and their
forefathers in past generations. The landlords contributed nothing,
or next to nothing, for its improvement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Mr. Mill thus writes of the
improvement of land in Ireland:
"Whenever in any country the proprietors, generally speaking, cease
to improve their lands, political economy has nothing to say in
defence of landed property as there established.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Reports of Government
Commissions.</b>
</small><br>
<small>The Bessborough and Richmond Commissions recently appealed
directly to the nation for information on this important point. The
answer which the nation returned was (as everyone knew should be the
case), that all, or nearly all the permanent improvements in the soil
of the country were effected by the labour and capital of the people
of the country. The Bessborough Commissioners write in their report:
"As a fact, the removal of masses of rock and stone which, in some
parts of Ireland, encumbered the soil, the drainage of the land and
erection of buildings, including their own dwellings, have generally
been effected by the tenants' labour, unassisted, or only in some
instances assisted, by advances from the landlord."</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>The Work of the Tenants.</b>
</small><br>
<small>The Liberal section of the Richmond Commission write, in their
report on the same subject: "In a country like Ireland, where the
dwelling houses, farm buildings and other elements of a farm,
including often the reclamation from the waste of the cultivated land
itself, have been, and must, in our opinion, continue to be, for the
most part, the work of the tenants."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even the Tory section of this
Richmond Commission, composed as it
is of men of the highest type of Conservatism and Landlordism,
observe with a frankness that shows the force of the evidence brought
before them:</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"Bearing in mind the system by
which the improvements, and
equipments of a farm are very generally the work of the tenant, and
the fact that a yearly tenant is at any time liable to have his rent
raised in consequence of the increased value that has been given to
his holding by the expenditure of his own capital and labour, the
desire for legislative interference to protect him from an arbitrary
increase of rent does not seem unnatural."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But further argument in proof of
this fact is quite unnecessary,
seeing that both Houses of the Legislature bear emphatic testimony to
it in that section of the Land Act of 1870, which declares that "all
permanent improvements in the soil and on the farm are assumed to
have been made by the tenant, except in those cases in which it has
been clearly proved they have been made by the landlord." The vast
property thus created by the labour and capital of the people, in the
permanent improvement of the soil and in the buildings and equipments
of their farms, and which has been growing and accumulating for
centuries, covers a very considerable part of the aggregate value of
the land of the country.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Driven From the Land.</b>
</small><br>
<small>The question then arises, what has become of this enormous
property? The correct answer to this question will, I think, be found
to be that one part of it has been wantonly wasted and destroyed;
that the landlords have coolly appropriated to their own use a second
part of it; and that the people pay, at the present moment, a rent
for the use of the residue of what was once all their own
property. </small><br>
<br>
<small>In the one County of Meath, in this Diocese, there are about
369,000 acres of land laid down in grass seeds or pasture. That vast
territory was nearly all parcelled out about the commencement of this
century in farms of various sizes, ranging from ten to seventy,
eighty or a hundred acres each. These farms were dotted over with
clean, commodious, comfortable, whitewashed dwellings, with offices,
outhouses and the plant of well-to-do farmers. These dwellings were
occupied by a race of the most laborious, industrious, hardworking
and virtuous people that ever lived in any country. But, owing to the
iniquitous system of Land Tenure, they have been almost all
mercilessly evicted and swept away, and every vestige of the vast
amount of human life, industry, contentment and happiness that once
flourished on these lands has been so carefully obliterated that,
looking at them in their present melancholy solitude, one would
imagine them to have always been "prairie lands" since the
creation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The property which these poor
people possessed in their dwellings
and farm houses has been thus wantonly destroyed, and the permanent
improvements they had created in the productiveness of the soil were
coolly appropriated by the landlords who evicted them.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>How Tenants are Rack-rented.</b>
</small><br>
<small>Until the Irish Land League interfered with their operations,
these exterminators sold out by public auction every year the use of
the people's property, as well as the natural productiveness of the
soil, to cattle dealers, for a term of nine, ten or eleven months,
and at a rent ranging from &pound;4 to &pound;6 an acre; and they drew
from their estates an income twice, and in many instances three times
as large as the few honest and honourable proprietors in their
neighbourhood who never evicted anyone at all. I need hardly direct
attention to the notorious fact that those who have been suffered to
remain, were only too glad to be allowed the privilege of paying a
rent for the use of the residue of what was once their own
property.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The proof of this is plain. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Proprietors, in letting their
land, do
not distinguish between the enormous value superadded to the land by
the people's labour and capital for centuries, and the value it has
inherited from nature, and, perhaps in some instances, from their own
improvements.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They let its whole value from
every source at the highest price it
will bring. And yet this sorely aggrieved class of men complain that
they can not now let their lands as they always let them before, and
as all other owners are allowed to sell their property still, on the
principle of open competition and free sale!</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>During the long, large and
varied experience the world has had of
the letting of land on that principle, was it ever heard that an
owner let his land at less than its fair value? -- and surely that
fair value included the people's improvements on the land as well as
his own. We have seen, on the high authority of Mr. Mill, that it is
the almost universal practice of Irish landlords to exact from their
tenants in the form of rent the whole produce of the land minus the
potatoes that are necessary to keep them from dying of hunger; and
surely rack-rents like these cover every form of value the land
possesses, and consequently the people's improvements.<a
