<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_PJER.html">Peace, Justice and Economic Reform</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is a bumper sticker that says, "If you want peace, then work
    for justice." At a superficial level, this simple slogan contains an important
    half-truth. At a deeper level, it contains a more profound half-truth. To
    understand these half-truths and why they are only half true, we need to
    know what peace
    is, what justice is, and we need to understand the relationship between the
    two. So in this talk I want to explore the meanings of peace and justice,
    their relationship,
    and the role of economic reform in attaining both.</p>
  <p>"If you want peace, then work for justice." The more obvious and superficial
    meaning of this slogan is that people who are treated unjustly will prevent
    the attainment of peace until the wrongs to which they are subject are righted.
    Demonstrators shout: "No justice. No peace." The apparent meaning of peace
    in this case is tranquility, the absence of strife. And if this meaning of
    peace is accepted, the slogan is true. You cannot expect to end strife as
    long as people have unresolved grievances. But the reason that this is only
    half
    true is that this meaning is only a shadow of what peace really is.</p>
  <p>Peace is more than armistice, more than the cessation of violence. Peace is
    unity and harmony. In a peaceful world people are all pleased to cooperate
    with one another. When we have attained true peace, there will be no person
    who has any purpose that any other person seeks to thwart. In a peaceful world,
    everyone will feel the truth of John Donne's meditation,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>No man is an Island entire of itself; every man is a piece of
        the Continent; a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe
        is the less, and well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy
        friends or of thine own were; any man's death diminishes me because I am
        involved in Mankind; therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
        it tolls for thee</i>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000" size="-1">[1]</font></span></small></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Is it imaginable that we might ever attain a world where everyone felt so?
    And if we do so, what will be the role of justice in that world? What is justice?

<p>Mark Twain &nbsp; <a href="../docs/Twain_archimedes.html">Archimedes</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... I know of a mechanical
force more powerful than anything the vaunting engineer of Syracuse
ever dreamed of. It is the force of land monopoly; it is a screw and
lever all in one; it will screw the last penny out of a man's pocket,
and bend everything on earth to its own despotic will. Give me the
private ownership of all the land, and will I move the earth? No; but
I will do more. I will undertake to make slaves of all the human
beings on the face of it. Not chattel slaves exactly, but slaves
nevertheless. What an idiot I would be to make chattel slaves of
them. I would have to find them salts and senna when they were sick,
and whip them to work when they were lazy. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No, it is not good enough. Under
the system I propose the fools
would imagine they were all free. I would get a maximum of results,
and have no responsibility whatever. They would cultivate the soil;
they would dive into the bowels of the earth for its hidden
treasures; they would build cities and construct railways and
telegraphs; their ships would navigate the ocean; they would work and
work, and invent and contrive; their warehouses would be full, their
markets glutted, and: </small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The beauty of the whole
concern would be<br>
That everything they made would belong to me. </b></small></center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be this way, you see: As
I owned all the land, they would
of course, have to pay me rent. They could not reasonably expect me
to allow them the use of the land for nothing. I am not a hard man,
and in fixing the rent I would be very liberal with them. I would
allow them, in fact, to fix it themselves. What could be fairer? Here
is a piece of land, let us say, it might be a farm, it might be a
building site, or it might be something else - if there was only one
man who wanted it, of course he would not offer me much, but if the
land be really worth anything such a circumstance is not likely to
happen. On the contrary, there would be a number who would want it,
and they would go on bidding and bidding one against the other, in
order to get it. I should accept the highest offer - what could be
fairer? Every increase of population, extension of trade, every
advance in the arts and sciences would, as we all know, increase the
value of land, and the competition that would naturally arise would
continue to force rents upward, so much so, that in many cases the
tenants would have little or nothing left for themselves. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It hardly needs to be said that it
would not be consistent with my
dignity to associate with the common rank and file of humanity; it
would not be politic to say so, but, as a matter of fact, I not only
hate work but I hate those who do work, and I would not have their
stinking carcasses near me at any price. High above the contemptible
herd I would sit enthroned amid a circle of devoted worshippers. I
would choose for myself companions after my own heart. I would deck
them with ribbons and gewgaws to tickle their vanity; they would
esteem it an honour to kiss my glove, and would pay homage to the
very chair that I sat upon; brave men would die for me, parsons would
pray for me, and bright-eyed beauty would pander to my pleasures. For
the proper management of public affairs I would have a parliament,
and for the preservation of law and order there would be soldiers and
policemen, all sworn to serve me faithfully; their pay would not be
much, but their high sense of duty would be a sufficient guarantee
that they would fulfil the terms of the contract. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Outside the charmed circle of my
society would be others eagerly
pressing forward in the hope of sharing my favours; outside of these
would be others again who would be forever seeking to wriggle
themselves into the ranks of those in front of them, and so on,
outward and downward, until we reach the deep ranks of the workers
forever toiling and forever struggling merely to live, and with the
hell of poverty forever threatening to engulf them. The hell of
poverty, that outer realm of darkness where there is weeping and
wailing and gnashing of teeth -- the social Gehenna, where the worm
dieth not, and the fire is not quenched -- here is a whip more
effective by far than the keenest lash of the chattel slave owner,
urging them on by day, haunting their dreams by night, draining
without stint the life blood from their veins, and pursuing them with
relentless constancy to their graves. In the buoyancy of youth many
would start full of hope and with high expectations; but, as they
journeyed along, disappointment would follow disappointment, hope
would gradually give place to despair, the promised cup of joy would
be turned to bitterness, and the holiest affection would become a
poisoned arrow quivering in the heart!
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What a beautiful arrangement --
ambition urging in front, want and
the fear of want bringing up the rear! In the conflicting interests
that would be involved, in the throat-cutting competition that would
prevail, in the bitterness that would be engendered between man and
man, husband and wife, father and son, I should, of course, have no
part. There would be lying and cheating, harsh treatment by masters,
dishonesty of servants, strikes and lockouts, assaults and
intimidation, family feuds and interminable broils; but they would
not concern Me. In the serene atmosphere of my earthly paradise I
would be safe from all evil. I would feast on the daintiest of
dishes, and sip wines of the choicest vintage; my gardens would have
the most magnificent terraces and the finest walks. I would roam mid
the umbrageous foliage of the trees, the blooming flowers, the
warbling of birds, the jetting of fountains, and the splashing of
pellucid waters. My palace would have its walls of alabaster and
domes of crystal, there would be furniture of the most exquisite
workmanship, carpets and hangings of the richest fabrics and finest
textures, carvings and paintings that were miracles of art, vessels
of gold and silver, gems of the purest ray glittering in their
settings, the voluptuous strains of the sweetest music, the perfume
of roses, the softest of couches, a horde of titled lackeys to come
and go at my bidding, and a perfect galaxy of beauty to stimulate
desire, and administer to my enjoyment. Thus would I pass the happy
hours away, while throughout the world it would be a hallmark of
respectability to extol my virtues, and anthems would be everywhere
sung in praise. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Archimedes never dreamt of
anything like that. Yet, with the earth
for my fulcrum and its private ownership for my lever, it is all
possible. If it should be said that the people would eventually
detect the fraud, and with swift vengeance hurl me and all my courtly
parasites to perdition, I answer, "Nothing of the kind, the people
are as good as gold, and would stand it like bricks - and I appeal to
the facts of today to bear me witness."&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
