Underlying Problem</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>My gentle Georgist grandparents tried for years to turn my attention toward
      seeing that there was one underlying problem. While we agreed on the manifestations,
      I could not &#8212; would not &#8212; see what they were trying to tell
      me: that under most of the social, economic and justice problems we saw
      around
      us, there was a single underlying cause. It sounded like conspiracy theory
      to me, and just didn't register.</p>
  <p>Now I've found myself circling back to see if I could see what they saw,
    and I've spent a number of years in a hypothesis-testing mode. Their hypothesis
      has held, and in the process, I've read many of the things that I found
    in
      their files and bookshelves, and I have come to the conclusion that they &#8212; and
      Henry George &#8212; had it right. </p>
  <p>It isn't that all of our social, economic and justice problems will simply
      evaporate completely when we as a society enact the reform Henry George recommended.
      Rather, it is that the primary cause will be removed, and while there may still
      be come poverty, some injustice, some social problems, a huge thick layer of
      the structural cause of each will be gone. What will remain of these problems
      will be easily within our ability to ease. Today, the things we try to do to
      ease poverty's effects don't do much to reduce poverty. But with the underlying
      cause gone, those same efforts will be very effective.</p>
  <p>By all means approach this skeptically. I certainly did. But don't ignore
    it.</p>

    Henry George: <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/the_crime_of_poverty.html">The
    Crime of Poverty&nbsp;</a> (1885 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
I say that all this poverty and the ignorance that flows from it is
unnecessary; I say that there is no natural reason why we should not
all be rich, in the sense, not of having more than each other, but in
the sense of all having enough to completely satisfy all physical
wants; of all having enough to get such an easy living that we could
develop the better part of humanity. There is no reason why wealth
should not be so abundant, that no one should think of such a thing as
little children at work, or a woman compelled to a toil that nature
never intended her to perform; wealth so abundant that there would be
no cause for that harassing fear that sometimes paralyses even those
who are not considered "the poor," the fear that every man of us has
probably felt, that if sickness should smite him, or if he should be
taken away, those whom he loves better than his life would become
charges upon charity. "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;
they toil not, neither do they spin." I believe that in a really
Christian community, in a society that honoured not with the lips but
with the act, the doctrines of Jesus, no one would have occasion to
worry about physical needs any more than do the lilies of the field.
There is enough and to spare. The trouble is that, in this mad
struggle, we trample in the mire what has been provided in sufficiency
for us all; trample it in the mire while we tear and rend each other.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There is a cause for this
poverty; and, if you trace it down, you will find its root in a primary
injustice. Look over the world today&#8212;poverty everywhere. The cause must
be a common one. You cannot attribute it to the tariff, or to the form
of government, or to this thing or to that in which nations differ;
because, as deep poverty is common to them all the cause that produces
it must be a common cause. What is that common cause? There is one
sufficient cause that is common to all nations; and that is the
appropriation as the property of some of that natural element on which
and from which all must live.&nbsp; ...</span></small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Did you ever think of the utter
absurdity and strangeness of the
fact that, all over the civilised world, the working classes are the
poor classes? Go into any city in the world, and get into a cab and
ask the man to drive you where the working people live. He won't take
you to where the fine houses are. He will take you, on the contrary,
into the squalid quarters, the poorer quarters. Did you ever think
how curious that is? Think for a moment how it would strike a
rational being who had never been on the earth before, if such an
intelligence could come down, and you were to explain to him how we
live on earth, how houses and food and clothing, and all the many
things we need were all produced by work, would he not think that the
working people would be the people who lived in the finest houses and
had most of everything that work produces? Yet, whether you took him
to London or Paris or New York, or even to Burlington, he would find
that those called the working people were the people who live in the
poorest houses. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> All this is strange &#8212; just think
of it. We naturally despise
poverty; and it is reasonable that we should. I do not say &#8212; I
distinctly repudiate it &#8212; that the people who are poor are poor
always from their own fault, or even in most cases; but it ought to
be so. If any good man or woman could create a world, it would be a
sort of a world in which no one would be poor unless he was lazy or
vicious. But that is just precisely the kind of a world this is; that
is just precisely the kind of a world the Creator has made. <b>Nature
gives to labour, and to labour alone; there must be human work before
any article of wealth can be produced; and in the natural state of
things the man who toiled honestly and well would be the rich man,
and he who did not work would be poor. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We have so reversed the order
of nature that we are accustomed to think of the workingman as a poor
man.</span> </b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">And
if you trace it out I believe you will see that the primary
cause of this is that we compel those who work to pay others for
permission to do so.</span> You may buy a coat, a horse, a house; there
you
are paying the seller for labour exerted, for something that he has
produced, or that he has got from the man who did produce it; but
when you pay a man for land, what are you paying him for? You are
paying for something that no man has produced; you pay him for
something that was here before man was, or for a value that was
created, not by him individually, but by the community of which you
are a part. What is the reason that the land here, where we stand
tonight, is worth more than it was twenty-five years ago? What is the
reason that land in the centre of New York, that once could be bought
by the mile for a jug of whiskey, is now worth so much that, though
you were to cover it with gold, you would not have its value? Is it
not because of the increase of population? Take away that population,
and where would the value of the land be? Look at it in any way you
please. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> We talk about over-production.
How can there be such a thing as
over-production while people want? All these things that are said to
be over-produced are desired by many people. Why do they not get
them? They do not get them because they have not the means to buy
them; not that they do not want them. Why have not they the means to
buy them? They earn too little. When the great masses of men have to
work for an average of $1.40 a day, it is no wonder that great
quantities of goods cannot be sold. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now why is it that men have to
work for such low wages? Because
if they were to demand higher wages there are plenty of unemployed
men ready to step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed
men who compel that fierce competition that drives wages down to the
point of bare subsistence. Why is it that there are men who cannot
get employment? Did you ever think what a strange thing it is that
men cannot find employment? Adam had no difficulty in finding
employment; neither had Robinson Crusoe; the finding of employment
was the last thing that troubled them. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> If men cannot find an employer,
why cannot they employ
themselves? Simply because they are shut out from the element on
which human labour can alone be exerted. Men are compelled to compete
with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been
robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves; because
they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
paving some other human creature for the privilege.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I do not mean to say that even
after you had set right this
fundamental injustice, there would not be many things to do; but this
I do mean to say, that our treatment of land lies at the bottom of
all social questions. This I do mean to say, that, do what you
please, reform as you may, <b>you never can get rid of wide-spread
poverty so long as the element on which and from which all men must
live is made the private property of some men. It is utterly
impossible. Reform government &#8212; get taxes down to the
minimum &#8212; build railroads; institute co-operative stores; divide
profits, if you choose, between employers and employed-and what will
be the result? The result will be that the land will increase in
value &#8212; that will be the result &#8212; that and nothing else.
Experience shows this. Do not all improvements simply increase the
value of land &#8212; the price that some must pay others for the
privilege of living?&nbsp; </b>... <a

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Crowded! Is it any wonder that
people are crowded together as they are in this city, when we see other
people taking up far more land than they can by any possibility use,
and holding it for enormous prices? Why, what would have happened if,
when these doors were opened, the first people who came in had claimed
all the seats around them, and demanded a price of others who
afterwards came in by the same equal right? Yet that is precisely the
way we are treating this continent.</small><br>
<br>
<small>That is the reason why people are huddled together in tenement
houses; that is the reason why work is difficult to get; the reason
that there seems, even in good times, a surplus of labor, and that in
those times that we call bad, the times of industrial depression, there
are all over the country thousands and hundreds of thousands of men
tramping from place to place, unable to find employment.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Not work enough! Why, what is work? Productive work is simply
the application of human labor to land, it is simply the transforming,
into shapes adapted to gratify human desires, of the raw material that
the Creator has placed here. Is there not opportunity enough for work
in this country? Supposing that, when thousands of men are unemployed
and there are hard times everywhere, we could send a committee up to
the high court of heaven to represent the misery and the poverty of the
people here, consequent on their not being able to find employment.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What answer would we get? "Are your lands all in use? Are your
mines all worked out? Are there no natural opportunities for the
employment of labor?" What could we ask the Creator to furnish us with
that is not already here in abundance? He has given us the globe amply
stocked with raw materials for our needs. He has given us the power of
working up this raw material.</small><br>
<br>
<small>If there seems scarcity, if there is want, if there are people
starving in the midst of plenty, is it not simply because what the
Creator intended for all has been made the property of the few? And in
moving against this giant wrong, which denies to labor access to the
natural opportunities for the employment of labor, we move against the
cause of poverty. ...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html"> <span

The Problem</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, however, we are coming into collision with facts which there can be
    no mistaking. From all parts of the civilized world come
    complaints;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>of industrial depression;</li>
    <li>of labor condemned to involuntary idleness;</li>
    <li>of capital massed and wasting;</li>
    <li>of pecuniary distress among business men;</li>
    <li>of want and suffering and anxiety among the working classes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All the dull, deadening pain, all the keen, maddening anguish, that to great
    masses of men are involved in the words "hard times," afflict the world today. <B>This
    state of things, common to communities differing so widely in situation, in
    political institutions, in fiscal and financial systems, in density of population
    and in social organization can hardly be accounted for by local causes.</B></p>
  <ul>
    <li>There is distress where large standing armies are maintained, but there
          is also distress where the standing armies are nominal;</li>
    <li>there is distress where protective tariffs stupidly and wastefully hamper
          trade, but there is also distress where trade is nearly free;</li>
    <li>there is distress where autocratic government yet prevails, but there
      is also distress where political power is wholly in the hands of the people;</li>
    <li>in countries where paper is money, and</li>
    <li>in countries where gold and silver are the only currency.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Evidently, beneath all such things as these, we must infer a common cause.</p>
  <p><B>That there is a common cause, and that it is either what we call material
      progress or something closely connected with material progress, becomes
      more than an inference when it is noted that the phenomena we class together
      and
      speak of as industrial depression, are but intensifications of phenomena
      which always accompany material progress, and which show themselves more
      clearly and strongly as material progress goes on. </B><I>Where the conditions
      to which material progress everywhere tends are most fully realized &#8212; that
      is to say, where population is densest, wealth greatest, and the machinery
      of production and exchange most highly developed &#8212; we find the deepest
      poverty, the sharpest struggle for existence, and the most enforced idleness. </I>... <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/ppintro.html">read

  <p><small>Our problem today, as yesterday,
        and the days before, back to the
        earliest recorded times, is POVERTY.</small>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are times when this problem
is lesser. We call these
"booms." There are also times when the problem is greatly
exacerbated. These are called "busts." But, as the Bible says, "the
poor have ye always with ye."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The purpose of this paper is to
explore the core of the problem.
It is not the position that there is only one single error afoot in
our social organizations. There may be several, there may be only a
few things to remedy. The position is, as stated earlier, that there
is one basic cause of the problem. Therefore, the removal of this one
basic error is the first, the primary step, for the simple reason
that, until this basic social evil is eradicated, no other reform
will avail. We will simply continue the boom and bust cycles until
the economies of the whole world are wrecked by inflation or by a
nuclear war triggered by the ongoing economic disaster.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let us begin this study of the
likely causes of our troubles by
asking two questions: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are we over-populated? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are the earth's
resources inadequate for this population?&nbsp; ...
    </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In our economy, land is a ready
object of speculation, and its
value is constantly reflecting this evil. What happens in a rising
market, the up side of a business cycle, is that investors see rising
prices in land as indicative of a boom. Thereupon, they try to
increase their holdings in such land, only to discover that their
present returns will not pay for the present costs of land; the
current price of land is not based on what the yield of that land is
today, but on what it is projected to be two or three years from now.
The difference tends to increase until a point is reached where the
imarginal buyer of land suddenly finds himself unable to meet the
rising costs to which he has subjected himself. With bankruptcy
threatening him or having already been forced upon him, the land
passes from his hands, and the market temporarily becomes overpriced.
The bankruptcies increase, and ultimately land values are brought
back to levels which represent current productivity, at which point
the new boom will have started.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The wringing out of land
speculation from the dynamics of
economics will remove that unacknowledged offence which has so
labored the economic profession and the public at large. As Henry
George discovered and as <a href="Hoyt.html">Homer Hoyt</a> so brilliantly depicted
speculative land prices as the cause of this bitter cycle, so will
its removal rid society of this hitherto hidden defect. It will put
the land market on a current value basis and eliminate the terrible
risks to which that market has always been subject in the past.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The reason for such speculation
under the present practices is
obvious. All products of labor are subject to increases or decreases
depending on supply and demand. When an oversupply of any commodity
begins to rear its ugly head, prices tend downward and production is
thereby lessened until there is a contrary swing upward. Land, on the
other hand, is of fixed supply. Nothing man does can increase or
decrease the amount of land, and therefore that brake that operates
in the field of production does not apply to land values and
prices.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Just think of the social benefits
that would accrue to a society
that could, at a stroke, rid itself of the potential hazards to which
all prior societies have been so subject. Production will then occur
on a steadily rising level, demand increases as the well-being of
society improves, new techniques develop, new inventions are made,
and all these will be benefits to the community as a whole, and not
just to the land-owners as in the past.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This occurs every day in this
country. A new road is built, or a
superhighway is constructed, which makes access to a particular site
much easier. We tell ourselves that we justify this as an
expenditure of public funds by the benefits that accrue to the
traveling public; but the benefits go, in the form of higher land
prices and rents, to the owners of the sites that are served by this
new road. If you doubt this, consider the jockeying for the insider
information or for influence over the selection.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Any
reader will recognize this chain of events and set of economic
relationships as being the course of everyday life and business at
the local, state and national level. <b>The cynic would say that a
primary motivation for entering local or even national politics would
be the opportunity for personal gain offered daily by publicly
financed improvements.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Thus, the benefits of a
tax-supported public work accrued once
more not to the benefit of the public at large, but to that of a very
limited and narrowly defined class, those who were rich enough to own
land in that location.</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are undoubtedly
many
other problems to be resolved before
the ills of our society are cured; but what many do not recognize and
understand is the primacy of the adoption of land value taxation over
all these other corrections. The reason for that can be very simply
stated: <b>If any of these other measures already adopted have no
merit and have only added to the burden of our problems, then they
are disqualified at the outset. On the other hand, if they are of
themselves beneficial, any benefit from them will be immediately
capitalized into land values and will therefore exacerbate the very
problems which otherwise might be helped toward a cure.</b> Thus it
is that our first step toward any possible remedy for the awesome

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the law of human
progress?&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George saw ours alone among the
civilizations of the world as
still progressing; all others had either petrified or had vanished.
And in our civilization he had already detected alarming evidences of
corruption and decay. So he sought out the forces that create
civilization and the forces that destroy it. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He found the incentives to
progress to be the desires inherent in
human nature, and the motor of progress to be what he called mental
power. But the mental power that is available for progress is only
what remains after nonprogressive demands have been met. These
demands George listed as maintenance and conflict. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his isolated state, primitive
man's powers are required simply
to maintain existence; only as he begins to associate in communities
and to enjoy the resultant economies is mental power set free for
higher uses. Hence, association is the first essential of progress:
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And as the wasteful expenditure of
mental power in conflict
becomes greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an
equality of rights is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice)
is the second essential of progress. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus association in equality is
the law of progress. Association
frees mental power for expenditure in improvement, and equality, or
justice, or freedom -- for the terms here signify the same thing, the
recognition of the moral law -- prevents the dissipation of this
power in fruitless struggles. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He concluded this phase of his
analysis of civilization in these
words: "The law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just
as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge the
equality of right between man and man, just as they insure to each
the perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty of
every other, must civilization advance. Just as they fail in this,
must advancing civilization come to a halt and recede..."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, as the primary relation
of man is to the earth, so must
the primary social adjustment concern the relation of man to the
earth. Only that social adjustment which affords all mankind equal
access to nature and which insures labor its full earnings will
promote justice, acknowledge equality of right between man and man,
and insure perfect liberty to each. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This, according to George, was
what the single tax would do. It
was why he saw the single tax as not merely a fiscal reform but as
the basic reform without which no other reform could, in the long
run, avail. This is why he said, "What is inexplicable, if we lose
sight of man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear
when we recognize it."... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span
