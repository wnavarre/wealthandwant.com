The documents I've chosen for this website are the result of my own
quirky reading and research patterns, and my own initial skepticism
about these ideas.&nbsp; If you'd like to nominate or submit other
papers, please feel free to (<a href="mailto:web@wealthandwant.com">mailto:web@wealthandwant.com</a>).&nbsp;
Similarly if you see documents that should be hyperlinked together, and
aren't, or additional theme pages that would help this website reach
more audiences, please call those opportunities to my attention.&nbsp;
If I've used some of your papers, I hope you approve!&nbsp; If you'd
like to comment on them, or update them, please let me know.&nbsp; I'll
happily add the material. <br>
<br>
My late paternal <a href="#My_grandparents">grandparents</a> (three of
them, actually) were longtime
Georgists, and my father and uncle took their first Georgist class as a teenager
circa 1939 in
New Jersey (see my grandmother's "<a href="docs/CarterM_intro.html">My
Introduction to Henry George</a>"); my aunt and uncle met through HGSSS
in Chicago.&nbsp; I grew up hearing about these ideas. I even
hung around at some <a href="docs/tred.html">TRED</a> conferences in
the late 60's. When I got to college, even as an economics major (ever
so briefly, after math and before American Studies), I did not
encounter more than a passing paragraph about Henry George.&nbsp; (By
the time I started college, I had received not one but two copies of <a
 href="George_P&P.html">P&amp;P</a> from my grandparents, lovingly
inscribed.&nbsp; I don't think I ever went beyond the inscription.)<br>
<br>
Largely through my own reading, before, during and after college, I
became interested in religious and ethnic minority groups &#8212; those
whose experience was, for various reasons, significantly different from
the mainstream &#8212; and in issues of poverty and inequality.&nbsp; My
grandparents did
their gentle best to suggest that I might find some of the answers I
was looking for in <a href="George_P&P.html">P&amp;P</a>, and I nodded
and said I'd read it.&nbsp;
(Never did, until rather recently.) &nbsp; We talked about what we saw
around us, and of course they, who saw the cat (though, loving the
three-dimensional furry type, never used that particular phrase),
understood the root causes, and tried, through gentle, leading
questions, to help me see what they saw.&nbsp; It just sounded like
some sort of conspiracy theory to me.&nbsp; How could one "thing" ever
be responsible for such a range of problems?<br>
<br>
It wasn't until after they were gone, and I went to collect from their
belongings the things that would be meaningful to family members (I
filled an SUV to its roof with photos, two pieces of furniture, some
household things I treasured from 25+ years of annual&nbsp;summer visits, and
boxes and boxes of books, files and
correspondence) that I got curious.&nbsp; Once home,
my
first
pass
through
the
files
and
correspondence was for genealogical clues I'd known to look for, and in
the process of that, I came across the draft of a document that my
grandfather had worked on over several years in the early 1980's, when
his eyesight was in decline.&nbsp; It was called "<small><a
 href="docs/Carter_Clarion.html">A Clarion Call to Sanity, to Honesty,
to
Justice</a>."&nbsp; The document had never quite gelled.</small>&nbsp;
But what was there got my attention.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it was simply
advancing age on my part, maybe it was that this paper intersected with
something I'd been told about myself years back when I was in the
middle of a career switch (I had taken some excellent aptitude tests
which
revealed that I had both many aptitudes and a peculiar, almost
discordant, combination of them, for which the long term recommendation
was that I either open my own business or "take on a grand cause" &#8212;
advice I had mentally filed away but started making room for in my
life). &nbsp; Maybe I'd found my "grand cause."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I approached Georgist ideas skeptically, a form of
hypothesis-testing.&nbsp; But 4+ years later, they are still holding
up and making sense.&nbsp; (How I wish I'd gotten there sooner, while I
still had my grandparents' minds and experience to joust with while I
explored.&nbsp; It would have been fun and far more efficient!)&nbsp;
I worked my way through the materials in their files, starting with
some of the shorter things (hey, when one isn't convinced, why start
with a long book, right? )&nbsp; One of the first things I hit was "<a
 href="HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>."&nbsp; It
resonated with me, and led me deeper into examining these ideas.&nbsp;
I no longer remember the exact course of my explorations.&nbsp; But
within about 6 months, I was attending my first <a
 href="http://www.progress.org/cgo">CGO meeting</a>, in
Pittsburgh. <br>
<br>
As we drove there from southwestern Connecticut, I told my husband
and son about the ten or so people I hoped to meet there.&nbsp; (Seven
were there, and one I've not yet met, though you'll find his works on
this site.)&nbsp; I read them Weld's
<a href="docs/Carter_Clarion.html">Clarion Call</a> paper.&nbsp; It
sounded dated to me, and I was mildly embarrassed by that &#8212;- two of
the issues it was most concerned about were fiat inflation and nuclear
war, both of which seemed quite distant issues as of Labor Day,
2001.&nbsp; Still, much of the paper was still inspiring to me.&nbsp;
Once at CGO, I put faces to a lot of names, met face to face someone
against whom I'd bid on ebay and with whom I'd been
corresponding.&nbsp; I sat
with laptop, and took notes, shared with several of those I met the
idea I had for a Georgist website, asking them for caution flags &#8212; and
got nothing but green lights.&nbsp;
My first meeting was a very steep learning curve.<br>
<br>
I told them then, and I'll tell you: I still regard myself as a very young
Georgist, not so much&nbsp; chronologically, but in terms of my
experience with these ideas.&nbsp; I'm self-taught.&nbsp; I read
P&amp;P, slowly, then moved on to SP, and SPE, unabridged.&nbsp; Interestingly,
in the early 90's, I had a copy of a small white book from the UK which was a
collection of HG
quotes, and many of them had made a lot of sense to me.&nbsp; (Eventually,
I hope to scan that book, and provide links from each quote into the
original texts.)<br>
<br>
Were it not for the internet, I would probably not have gotten so
actively involved in seeking to share this movement.&nbsp; I'm not a
pen and paper person, and while books are wonderful, a reality is that
they meet a relatively small audience today.&nbsp; But as more people
get on the internet, it is possible to meet the curious where they are &#8212; or
rather
be
available for the curious to find us &#8212; if only we can provide material
they're looking for.&nbsp; My website idea was one designed around the
interests of the audience.&nbsp; The structure has evolved a great deal
since that first summer, but the focus is pretty much the same.<br>
<br>
Events in the six months following that CGO meeting also led me to
think about my grandfather's paper further &#8212; first 9/11, which made
the issue of nuclear war not sound quite so remote as it had a few
weeks before, then huge inflation in the Argentine currency, with all
its attendant misery for the Argentine people.<br>
<br>
All of this is to say that my reading has been a function of the
documents in my grandparents' files and what I've been attracted to
online, based on my quirky research style.&nbsp; Your favorites may not
be here.&nbsp; I'd be interested in knowing what inspired and inspires
you.<br>
<br>
Further, if you have in mind other <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/Index.html">themes</a>
that you think would be
useful means to share our ideas, I'd welcome your suggestions.&nbsp;  Some of
these themes originated in the 180 or so Georgist documents on this website.
Others began as a way to organize material in response to my frustrated attempts
to talk back to various guests on CSPAN whose analyses, as Bill Vickrey would
have put it, would benefit from an application of the ideas of Henry George.  I
hope to mine P&amp;P as I have the other 160 documents; now that the system is set
up, it is not particularly difficult.<br>
<br>
I've borrowed shamelessly from other Georgist sites (always with full
attribution in the form of a link at the top of the page!) and from a
range of nonGeorgist studies.&nbsp; I hope that this website will bring
more people to those sites, which contain much information that will
resonate for them.&nbsp; My background is in consumer products
marketing, and quantitative people analysis.&nbsp; I hope that I can
bring those skills to sharing our movement with a wide audience, and
create the curiosity in them that all of us have.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How You
Can Help</span>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nitpick!</span>&nbsp; I can't
promise I'll get to all the nits instantly, but I will appreciate
knowing about them.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Propose links I've
failed to
create <em>within</em> this website.</span>&nbsp; As I worked on this, my sense
of urgency and energy levels sometimes did not leave me time to excerpt
articles as I wish I had. For example, the "themes"
pages arose over a period of time, as I re-read the documents which
form the core of the website.&nbsp; There may very well be sections of
the documents I indexed early in the process which contain material to
which a link would
be appropriate from a "theme" page that I didn't create until
later.&nbsp; Please call missed opportunities to my attention! </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Propose additional documents
that
belong on this website &#8212; your own and others'.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suggest additional themes</span>
&#8212; and the documents you'd link to that theme.&nbsp; There are over 650
themes in the<a href="themes/aa_all_themes.htm"> index</a>.</li>
  <li>Provide me <span style="font-weight: bold;">feedback </span>on
some of my rants and comments, if you think I've missed the mark or
need to expand on a point.</li>
  <li>If you think further <span style="font-weight: bold;">comments </span>are
called for on various pieces, please share those comments with me! </li>
  <li>If you have some favorite Georgist <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">quotes </span>you think should be
featured on various theme pages, let me know.&nbsp; I'd like to be able to show
the source for each one.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>If you're interested, join the <span style="font-weight: bold;">MTTS
    </span>(Marketing the Tax Shift) mailing list at topica. It would
be a
good forum for discussing this website.</li>
  <li>If you see errors &#8212; either of omission or of commission &#8212; call
them to my attention!&nbsp; I am still a very young Georgist, and I'm
still on the 45&deg; portion of my learning curve.  </li>
  <li>If you see a synthesis of some material on this website that you
haven't seen written up, share it!&nbsp; Your AHA! may shine light for
someone else.&nbsp; Write it up and send it to me, and I'll see whether
I can fit it in.&nbsp; (Maybe AHAs will become their own section of
the website.)</li>
  <li>If you have a newer version of a piece of your work that is on
this website, I'd be happy to substitute it.&nbsp; Most likely, I will
not update all the theme pages that contain links to and excerpts from
the article.&nbsp; If you've added material, call the additions to my
attention so that I can mine them for themes which should contain links
to the new text. </li>
  <li>If you have sent a proposal to the federal tax reform panel, and would
    like to share it on this website, I'd welcome it, and will set up a section
    of
    the
    website for such proposals.</li>
  <li>At some point, it may make sense to add some links on various theme pages
    to additional articles that do not reside on this website. I will welcome
    your suggestions for those links. (At the moment, I envision those as &quot;updates.&quot;)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">When we agree that this website
is
close enough to "ready for prime time," share it with your friends.</span>&nbsp;
Think
about whether starting them on the main page is best, or whether there
is a particular theme page that might be a better entry point for
someone with their set of interests.&nbsp; And give me feedback! My goal is to
provide as many entrances as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>What you see on this website is the first two layers of what is to be a much
larger website. The Georgist material is the foundation.</p>
<p>To the extent that I've added value to the documents I've included, I
    hereby grant Georgist license for the use of my contributions: use the
    material I've created in whatever way you see fit to further share
    these ideas.&nbsp; Create your own themed pages for specific people or
    groups, formatted and linked as you think best.</p>

<a name="My_grandparents"></a>*My grandparents were Weld Carter
(1900-1989) and Marjorie Carter
(1902-1963), and Weld's second wife, Jessie Tredway Matteson Carter
(1911-2001).&nbsp; It was Jessie's first husband, Archie Matteson, who
taught a P&amp;P course in Westwood, NJ (<a
 href="docs/CarterM_intro.html">described fictionally</a> by Marjorie
in the early 40's)
which the entire family took in 1939 or so. &nbsp; Both Jessie and
Archie remained family friends (I know Weld saw Archie at a Georgist
gathering in Bryn Mawr circa 1978), and after Marjorie's death, Weld
married Jessie, who had worked for John Monroe at the Chicago HGSSS
since
sometime in the 1940s.&nbsp; (Her books are stamped "JTMatteson, HGSSS,
desk copy").&nbsp; Jessie's father had known Weld's father (they were
boyhood chums in rural Chatham, Pittsylvania, Virginia, and continued their
acquaintance when both moved to NYC as young men in the 1890s) and
their grandmothers were fast friends &#8212; though due to the vagaries of
Weld's life as a young man, he was not aware of this.<br>
<br>
Weld and Marjorie were "on tour" (eventually living in a 28' Airstream
for years at a time) on behalf of <a
 href="docs/Aller_RSF.html">RSF</a> in the 50s and early 60s,
visiting university economics faculty to encourage interest in HG's
ideas.&nbsp; A document he developed during that period as <a
 href="docs/CarterW_intro.html">an introduction to Henry George</a> is
on this website.&nbsp; In the late 60s, funded largely by RSF, Weld began working
with <a
 href="auth/Gaffney.html">Mase
Gaffney</a>, Arthur Becker and others to develop the <a
 href="docs/tred.html">Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic
Development</a> (TRED).&nbsp; In the years Weld was involved, TRED convened
twelve annual conferences resulting in twelve volumes of contemporary
Georgist literature.&nbsp; Some of these books are still available from the
RSF.<br>
<br>
Jessie is a particular inspiration to me.&nbsp; She attempted to send
off an activist letter every day.&nbsp; I attribute my "letter to the
editor" interest to her, and am grateful, again, for electronic media
which permit me to do mine without ever putting a piece of paper in a
typewriter or a stamp on a letter.<br>
